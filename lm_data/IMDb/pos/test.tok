" What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director 's point of view . Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war , Nazis and hardship . An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make . Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled ( in the beginning ) love . I adored Christian Bale playing Mandras the heroine 's husband-to-be , he looks very very good as a Greek , his personality matched the one of the Greek patriot ! A true fighter in there , or what ! One of the movies I would like to buy and keep it in my collection ... for ever ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man혚General Douglas MacArthur . This is of course , the story of one of America 's great military figures , and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory . Though there is a continuity issue ( there may be others ) e.g. MacArthur 's speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 address to the U.S. Military Academy on accepting the Thayer award did not contain the phrase " " old soldiers never die ; they just fade away . " " ( That was in his speech to Congress upon his dismissal by President Truman ) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination ( these two did not see eye to eye ! ) Gregory Peck is im-Peck-able as the general who vowed he would return to the Philippines in World War II . The film moves quickly and easily with the General , his family and his staff from the beginning of the Second World War to the end of his service career . This film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both WW II and the Korean War . Nevertheless , Peck 's portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed .

" This movie is one of the funniest , saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have pervaded the Balkans yet again , 45 years after the time depicted . All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger , sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response . The accuracy of portrayal and the timelessness of the types , however , make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex-Yugoslavia to its madness . In fact , no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything until they saw this movie , and its twin , * Maratonci trce pocasni krug . * Did I mention it is one of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie . The fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath Yuen Woo Ping , who also did the fights in The Matrix . And the fight scenes are somethin.Li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain , who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian ( ya got me ) . When other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade , Li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them.There are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie ( one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices ) . The fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches ; the body count is way up there . Li has seldom been better , and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars ( Yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier ) . Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord ( no suprises there ; he makes a cameo in every HK movie ) . It 's unfortunate they don 't make action movies like this in the US ; I wouldn 't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that I crave so much .

" This gem captures early 80 's life brilliantly . As a grad ' 83 boymyself , I must say that Valley Girl ( along with Fast Times atRidgemont High ) stands out as the class of the teen sex filmgenre . The characters are accurate representatives of the era ; thevapid mall chicks , pseudo punk rebels , preppy jocks are allrepresented here.I have seen this over ten times now . The music in the film was topnotch . Unfortunately , these tunes could were never as popular intheir era as those by arena cockrockers like Journey , Styx orLoverboy . Before the soundtrack existed , I searched out recordsand tapes ( it was the 80 's after all ! ) of Josie Cotton , Sparks , Plimsouls and Modern English.This movie deserves respect . It isn 't just a good 80 's teen flick . It isa great film . Period . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A delight from start to finish.If you don 't like the Muppets , then I just have to feel sorry for you . This terrific film doesn 't simply cash in on the Muppets ' popularity -- it 's a well-conceived and well-written film in its own right . It 's got great songs , and it has that thread of wistful melancholy that was always present in Jim Henson 's creations and which is most personified in the character of Kermit the Frog . I always responded to this as a kid , and it 's what makes the Muppets still enjoyable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children drives me crazy.A huge cast of big names appearing in cameos makes this film feel like a kiddie-sized version of " " Around the World in 80 Days , " " except that it 's about 80 times better.Grade : A , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Pecker " " proves that Waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age . A lot of things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s , but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do . Over the years , the budget of Waters ' films has increased considerably . This is one of his most recent productions , but I was amazed to see that Waters still has that " " trailer-park " " touch . Edward Furlong plays Pecker , a kid who is obsessed with photography . He lives a quite life in Baltimore , MD , with his friends and family . But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent ( the always watchable Lili Taylor ) , and his life changes for the worst . Once again , Waters makes fun of art , fame and heterosexuality . It is not among his best films , but there are some big belly laughs here ( " " Memama " " has the best lines in the film ! ) . It is consistently clever and funny , and has that very " " queer " " sensibility that I have come to love in Warters ' movies . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " House Calls " " is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as " " how they used to make them . " " It stars Walter Matthau ( in one of his best roles ) as a recently widowed doctor who goes out on the dating scene again and hits paydirt as he seems to have a different woman every night . He then meets hospital patient Glenda Jackson and soon develops a relationship with her . But it 's one that will be severely tested as she informs him she is a one man woman and expects him to be a one woman man.This is a sweet , very funny film also starring Art Carney as the senile hospital administrator and Richard Benjamin as Matthau 's friend and fellow doctor . It 's a must see for any Matthau fan or any fan of light comedy.You won 't be disappointed . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" After playing a nymphomaniac in WRITTEN ON THE WIND , Dorothy Malone finally said good-bye to her sweet sister / wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them . She and Gloria Grahame played the same sort of tramps--and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role , Malone won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.The film she 's in is not quite up to Oscar standards , but it is a strong enough melodrama under Douglas Sirk 's capable hands . There 's an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has ROCK HUDSON , LAUREN BACALL , ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE as its headliners.Domestic squabbles among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama , with the accent on the strong supporting players , Stack and Malone . Both of them seize the opportunity with both hands and Stack , too , should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak , alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives.The nominal stars have less impressive work to do , but do it with their usual skill and conviction--Hudson and Bacall . They play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding.The use of color is particularly striking ( as it usually is in a Sirk film ) and yet it doesn 't preclude me from thinking of the film as a Technicolor film noir in the vein of LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN.Well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When watching A Bug 's Life for the first time in a long while , I couldn 't help but see the comparisons with last year 's Happy Feet . As far as the main storyline goes , they are very similar , an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special . It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion . A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar 's sophomore effort . Sure it doesn 't manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story , nor is the animation out of this world . However , the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with . With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot , I could watch this one just as much as the studio 's other classics.There is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here . Between our lead Flick needing to keep his self-esteem up to save his colony , the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future , and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks , everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story . Even the villain Hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons . He is not doing it to be mean , but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1 . He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth . It is very much a circle of life , but not one that can 't evolve with the ages.When thinking about the animation , it is actually quite good . Compared to Antz , the rival film of the time , this is much more realistic and less cartoony . The water is rendered nicely , as is the foliage . You don 't have to look much further than the ants ' eyes to see how much detail went into the production . The reflections and moistness , despite the smooth exterior , shows the realism . All the bugs are finely crafted too . The flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on , whether for a small role or a more expanded one . It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments . While Ant Island is nice , it is just the outdoors . Bug City contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs . It is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything . From the ice cube trays as circus stands , the animal crackers box as circus wagon혰complete with full nutrition guide on the side혰and crazy compilation of boxes to create a Times Square of billboards and facades , everything is done right.As far as much of the humor , you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices . No one could do a male ladybug better than Dennis Leary with his acerbic wit . I dare you to think of someone better . Our leads are great too with Dave Foley as Flick and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Princess Atta , as well as the always-fantastic Kevin Spacey as Hopper . Spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie , but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits . Yes , A Bug 's Life was the originator of animated outtakes from Pixar , a tradition that has continued on . With many tongue-in-cheek bug jokes laced throughout , you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast . Full of " " those guy actors , " " it is people like Richard Kind , Brad Garrett , and the late Joe Ranft as Heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs.Overall , it may be the simplest story brought to screen by Pixar , one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years , but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience . There are joyous moments , sad times , and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun . Complete with a couple of my favorite Pixar characters , Tuck and Roll , there isn 't too much bad that I can think of saying about it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What can I say ? Curse of Monkey Island is fantastic .

" Starring : Jim Carrey , Morgan Freeman , Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie . I mean , what a conceptual NIGHTMARE . Jim Carrey playing God ? Nothing is sacred anymore.Well , this movie is hardly sacred , but it also is not sacrilegious , at least not to any great extent . Yes , Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while , but he is not God . Confused ? I 'll give you the low down.Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan , a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life . He lives with his beautiful girlfriend , Grace ( Anniston ) , and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other , but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground.Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman , only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter . Obviously not please , Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired.Much complaining and griping about God later , Bruce gets a page . After a while he gets tired of it calling , so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building ( heh ) . There he meets God ( Freeman ) , who is the Boss , Electrician , and Janitor of the building . I found this highly amusing . God is the Boss , the Holy Spirit is the Electrician , and Jesus Christ is the Janitor . Think about it . Boss , obvious . Electrician , the guy who keeps everything running . Janitor , the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left . BRILLIANT.Anyway , Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God , but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God , he starts to believe a bit . Wonder why . Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.Since this is Hollywood , Bruce obviously eventually smartens up , learns his lesson , and starts using his powers for the good of the world . In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done , not Bruce 's.Since it is Jim Carrey , the movie is quite amusing , and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it . The movie is not perfect theology , but for Hollywood , it is definitely a good attempt . Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging , and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.So , while far from perfect , definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.Bottom Line : 3.5 out of 4 ( worth a view or two ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Coming from Oz I probably shouldn 't say it but I find a lot of the local movies lacking that cohesive flow with a weak storyline . This comedy lacks in nothing .

" If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber , just a look at his new film , " " Everything is Illuminated " , " which clearly shows a man that is not only one of America 's finest actors , but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow . Mr. Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material . The film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas.For those who haven 't watched the film , perhaps you should stop reading here.Jonathan is a collector . His love for his grandparents is boundless . He watches as his grandfather dies and as his grandmother is on what appears to be her death bed . On a clear moment , this dying woman gives Jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for his collection . Watching the photograph , taken a long time ago , a young couple are seen together . Watching makes Jonathan think it shows the grandfather and his girlfriend , taken on happier times . Watching the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to go looking for his ancestors ' past in the Ukraine.Jonathan has made arrangements with a travel agency , Heritage Tours , of Odessa for his trip to Trochenbrod , the mythical place where his grandfather came from . The agency is handled by an older man , who claims to be blind , and his grandson , Alex , a man who loves the pop American culture that has captured his imagination , as well as his contemporaries in the country . Alex speaks a kind of English no one speaks and his conversation and translation , for Jonathan 's benefit are hilarious to our ear for the use of sometimes unheard English terms . The old man insists in taking his dog , Sammy Davis Jr . , against the wishes of Jonathan , who doesn 't want to sit next to the snarling and barking animal during the trip.As they embark in search of Trochenbrod , it 's clearly that his companions , especially the old man has no clue where he is going . At this point , the film becomes a road movie , as the three characters riding the back roads of the country become more acquainted with one another . As the trio arrive at the sunflower field with the house at the end , it indicates they have indeed come to the right place . Some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past.The older woman , living in the isolated place , is the missing link of the story . She is able to put things into the right perspective . But here is where the story changes its emphasis from Jonathan , who clearly has come to the land of his ancestors , to the old man . We watch as this older man starts remembering things about himself . This , in turn , changes the dynamic of the film as we discover how connected Jonathan and his guides have been all the time.Some criticism in these pages have expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story , which after all , it 's a work of fiction and liberties have been taken . It would have been impossible to make another film including so much that is contained in the book . The great way the film is divided into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what 's about to be seen.Elijah Wood , a magnificent film actor , does an excellent work by underplaying Jonathan . Mr. Wood makes one of his best appearances in any film with his interpretation of the main character . The felicitous casting of Eugene Hutz as Alex , the Ukranian tour assistant and translator , seems to be an idea made in heaven . Mr. Hutz is about the best thing in the film . His arcane usage of English gives the film a funny angle that delights the viewer . Boris Leskin as Alex 's grandfather and driver of the tour car makes a valuable contribution to the film , as well as Laryssa Lauret , who is seen in the last part of the movie.The excellent cinematography of Matthew Libatique brings the splendor of the Czech Republic 's countryside in all its magnificence . The musical score by Paul Cantelon is heard in the background adorning the film in ways that it adds a richness to the movie.Above all , this is a triumph for Liev Schreiber , the first time director that will surely go far in whatever he decides to do next . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" How strange the human mind is ; this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored , and in which one 's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain , this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory . And how much do we really know of it 's inner-workings , of it 's depth or capacity ? What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream ? Or can we ? Perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see , like looking at a painting by Monet , in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality . It 's a concept visited by filmmaker Cameron Crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film , ' Vanilla Sky , ' starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz . At the age of thirty-three , David Aames ( Cruise ) inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father . His fifty-one percent controlling interest , however , has made him something of a marked man , as there are seven members of his board of directors , and each deems himself more worthy than the young Mr. Aames of the lion 's share of the company . And fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that David lacks the focus the job requires.Admittedly , David likes to play ; still , he 's in control of the business and does what he sees fit , whether the board ( he refers to them as the ' Seven Dwarfs ' ) likes it or not , and no one has ever had the courage to challenge him directly . But during a lavish birthday party in his honor , one of the corporate lawyers , Thomas Tipp ( Timothy Spall ) warns David that the seven are up to something behind his back . At the time , however , it 's the last thing on David 's mind ; he 's been having a casual affair with a friend , Julie Gianni ( Cameron Diaz ) , but even that moves to the back burner when he meets a woman at his party that he can 't get out of his mind . Her name is Sofia ( Penelope Cruz ) , and after knowing her for only one night , she becomes a pivotal part of his life-- which is about to be turned upside down , as on the morning after his party he makes a decision that will change his life forever . And he is about to learn that sometimes , there is simply no going back.Director Cameron Crowe has crafted and delivered much more than just another film with this one ; far more than a movie , ' Vanilla Sky ' is a vision realized . Beginning with the first images that appear on screen , he presents a visually stunning experience that is both viscerally and cerebrally affecting . It 's a mind-twisting mystery that will swallow you up and sweep you away ; emotionally , it 's a rush-- and it may leave you exhausted , because it requires some effort to stay with it . But it 's worth it . Think ' Memento ' with a driving rock n ' roll soundtrack and a vibrant assault of colors proffered by the stroke of an impressionist 's brush . There 's darkness and light , and sounds that pound and drive until you can feel the blood rushing through your veins and throbbing in your brain . And all played out on a landscape of virtual reality swirling beneath that ever expanding vanilla sky . Simply put , this one 's a real trip ; it 's exciting-- and it 's a mind bender.As to the performances here , those who can 't get past the mind-set of Tom Cruise as Maverick in ' Top Gun , ' or his Ethan Hunt in ' Mission Impossible , ' or those who perceive him only as a ' movie star ' rather than an actor , are going to have to think again in light of his work here . Because as David Aames , Cruise gives the best performance of his career , one that should check any doubts as to his ability as an actor at the door . He 's made some interesting career choices the past few years , with films like ' Magnolia ' and ' Eyes Wide Shut ' merely warm-ups for the very real and complex character he creates here . And give him credit , too , for taking on a role that dispels any sense of vanity ; this is Cruise as you 've never seen him before . ' Jerry Maguire ' earned him an Oscar nomination , and this one should , also-- as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peers . Cruise is not just good in this movie , he is remarkable.Penelope Cruz turns in an outstanding , if not exceptional performance , as well , as Sofia , the woman of David 's dreams . There 's an alluring innocence she brings to this role that works well for her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible , yet she lacks any hint of mystery that may have added that special ' something extra ' to the part . But Crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors , and he certainly did with Cruz.He also knew what he was doing with Cameron Diaz , who is absolutely vibrant in the role of Julie . She 's never looked better , and fairly sizzles on screen . But make no mistake , this is no ' window-dressing ' part , and Diaz delivers a complete package with this character . The quality of her performance can be measured , in fact , in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time . And it 's the persona she integrates so fully with her innate beauty that makes Julie so unforgettable . Overall , a terrific job by Diaz.The supporting cast includes Kurt Russell ( Dr. McCabe ) , Jason Lee ( Brian ) , Johnny Galecki ( Peter ) , Armand Schultz ( Dr. Pomerantz ) , Noah Taylor ( Ed ) , Mel Thompson ( ' L.E. ' Man ) , Jean Carol ( Woman in New York ) and John Fedevich ( Silent Ed ) . About half-way through , this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality ; but rest assured , by the end of ' Vanilla Sky ' all will be revealed . It 's a reality-bender , to be sure , and a wild one ; but this is exciting entertainment that offers a satisfying-- and unique-- experience , one you have to see to believe . It 's the essential , and absolute , magic of the movies . 10 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of the movies that get better every time you see them . It 's packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail . As in Sabu 's subsequent movies ( I didn 't see " " Unlucky monkey " " yet , but the other ones are as great ) failure , chance and humanism play great roles . The cutting and Montage is inventive and artistic , without the movie being an " " art " " picture , but a highly entertaining one . When comparing it to " " Run , Lola , Run " " you have to keep in mind that " " Dangan Ranna " " was made some years before and was shown on German TV as early as 1997 ... so it 's more probable that it served as inspiration for Tom Tykwer 's movie , and not the other way around .

" Never having seen this movie , based on the entertaining novel by Nicholas Katzenbach , and taking into consideration the first rate cast assembled for the production , we decided to take a look . " " Just Cause " , " while not a horrible film , takes too many liberties with the original material that Jeb Stuart didn 't quite succeed in his treatment . Arne Glimcher directed.The first thing we think when a young black man is hauled to the local precinct for interrogation is police brutality . After all , sheriff Tanny Brown , and police officer Wilcox , show no mercy in beating Bobby Earl , who is accused of killing a young white girl . We feel horrified by what the officers do to the prisoner.Then , the scene changes . Evangeline , Bobby Earl 's grandmother is sent north to ask a distinguished Harvard professor , a retired lawyer , the young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him . She old woman is convincing enough for Armstrong to take a look at the case . He is also convinced of the young man 's innocence.Things are not exactly what we thought they were . When Blair Sullivan , a man who is serving time in the same facility as Bobby Earl , comes forward to tell about how he is connected to the young girl 's murder , and changes the dynamics of the case . The way it plays in the movie , it serves to confuse the viewer and distract Armstrong from arriving at the truth.This thriller is made enjoyable by Sean Connery , who plays Armstrong . Laurence Fishburne , an intense actor , makes a fine impression as the Sheriff who , as far as we can see , is guilty of abusing his prisoner . Ed Harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors . Blair Underwood , Kate Capshaw , Ruby Dee and the young Scarlett Johansson are seen in supporting roles.The film , even with its faults , will not disappoint . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The sad thing about Frontline is that once you watch three or four episodes of it you really begin to understand that it is not far away from what happens in real life . What is really sad is that it also makes extremely funny.The Frontline team in Series One consists of Brian Thompson ( Bruno Lawrence ) - a man who truly lives and dies merely by the ratings his show gets . Occasionally his stunts to achieve these ratings see him run in with his Line Producer Emma Thompson ( Alison Whyte ) ; a woman who hasn 't lost all her journalistic integrity and is prepared to defend moral scruples on occasions . The same cannot be said of Reporter Brooke Vandenberg ( Jane Kennedy ) - a reporter who has had all the substance sucked out of her- so much so that when interviewing Ben Elton she needs to be instructed to laugh . Her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities ( with whom she has or hasn 't ' crossed paths ' with before ) or scandalous unethical reports that usually backfire . Martin De Stasio ( Tiriel Mora ) is the reporter with whom the team relies on for gravitas and dignity , as he has the smarts of 21 years of journalism behind him . His doesn 't have principles so much as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story , though he does draw the occasional line . Parading over this chaos ( in name ) is Mike Moore ( Rob Sitch ) an egotistical , naive reporter who can 't see that he 's only a pretty face for the grubby journalism . He often finds his morals being compromised simply because Brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest.Frontline is the sort of show that there needs to be more of , because it shows that while in modern times happiness , safety and deep political insight are interesting things ; it 's much easier to rate with scandal , fear and tabloid celebrities . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies , in my opinion , that are perfect . This little B picture is a taut story , well told . I 've always been intrigued by Alexander Knox , but have seen him very few movies . Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm , a sad little man who turns into a monster . He betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse . The performance is one of the most chilling performances I 've ever seen . Since World War 2 , actors who played Nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for Oscars . I imagine that since this was made during the war , the Academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil . But Knox puts in that kind of performance--a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer . I still can 't get over it.Marsha Hunt , who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly , is cast against type in probably the best performance I 've ever seen her give , too . Maybe not Oscar worthy , but the best of her career . Nothing against her ; I have enjoyed her in those " " slight " " roles she often played . But here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama.If you like human drama stories , or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis , I highly recommend this fine little film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " Sister Helen " " is a superb documentary about a rigid , intolerant , foul mouthed , bitter , oblate ( civilian ) nun who runs a shelter for drunks and dopers in a very rundown neighborhood in the south Bronx . All but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunks / addicts . Robert , the only middle class representative 혯 he had a real job , house , and even a BMW 혯 regrets she died before he could tell her off . Why ? Robert , like six of the residents , was on parole . He complained that Helen wielded a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didn 't cow-tow to her . In an " " extras " " interview he said Helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life 혯 her husband and her two boys . The husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55 . One boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15 . Helen was left with one daughter , who she abandoned to run the center . The daughter was not pleased . She wanted her momWhat 's fascinating is how little Helen changed . Outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change . But after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times -- once with the directors narrating -- it became clear that Helen substituted 21 male addicts to boss around to replace her three dead males . Helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars . But her bossiness , intolerance , and sharp tongue didn 't emerge at age 56 . Living with her must have been extremely difficult . Even Robert says he stayed clean in spite of Helen . The film opens with Helen abusively demeaning a man who wants to live at the shelter . Supposedly she is showing off her street savvy . Another time she publicly demeans Mel , her " " assistant " " for not bathing for a year . Then she waves his filthy pillowcase in the air . The film is viscous with Helen threatening and demeaning people . Her signature song is " " My Way . " " Her favorite phrase is , " " I 'm going to be totally honest with you . " " Often , people who use such phrases , turn out o be the opposite . The residents are really down and out . Only Robert has any marketable skills beyond pushing a broom . They all desperately need a roof over their heads , and Helen , since she runs the place on her own , has the power to admit or evict whoever she pleases . She has no governing board to answer to and gets no public funding . It is her show . Helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety . She stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too . She blames substance abuse on the drug or booze , and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug . She 's no therapist , just a landlady who dyes her hair , wears a habit , and wields complete power over her tenants , and stopped drinking . Helen also lords it over her inmates by demanding urine ( ureen she calls it ) tests on requests . Twice Major , a very solid and respected long term older resident -- who she trusted -- failed his tests . Helen was furious and evicted him . Major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin . Helen didn 't yield and failed to consider a mistake could have been made . This was especially troubling since she knew Major for a long time . Yet she discounted her relationship with him , assumed he was a liar , and relied completely on the results . Major eventually discovered the codeine in his cough syrup showed up as an opiate . Helen never apologized publicly , but supposedly made up with major privately.Helen also had a very tainted reputation in her old neighborhood . She tacitly admitted to Robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someone 's tires . The person wronged her and certainly deserved to have his / her tires slashed . She was not a nice woman . So eventually , she decided the only way to keep the Travis name ( her last name ) alive 혯 since the three male Travises died 혯 was to start the Travis Center.For some of the residents it was a great deal . They complied with Helen and in exchange received a cheap , safe , sober , and structured place to live . One however , said he preferred jail . Addicts and drunks don 't all need to be treated like children . Helen employed " " old school " " techniques which have been discredited . However , no one was forced to remain at the center and for some , it was definitely a positive experience . The Travis Center is not a treatment center . It is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who what to straighten out their lives . To receive the full Sister Helen experience , see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with Sister Helen and her guests . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The original DeMille movie was made in 1938 with Frederic March . A very good film indeed . Hollywood 's love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring Yul Brynner . He of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies . Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a stroke of genius . However , the movie did tend to get a little long in places . It does not move at the pace of the 1938 version . Still , it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As drunken millionaire playboy Arthur Bach , Dudley Moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood . As it turned out , the role fit Moore so perfectly , it trapped him as an actor as well . Many disappointments soon followed ( including this film 's pale sequel ) , yet that doesn 't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture , which is cleverly written and directed . Some of Moore 's drunk scenes are forced , parts of the film are wobbly , but the cast performs with so much relish it 's a difficult movie to resist . It has a very big heart and gives Oscar-winner John Gielgud a sly , dryly amusing role as Arthur 's valet , Hobson ; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport . Liza Minnelli ( as a blue-collar love-interest ) is sassy in a low-key and Moore is brash , but deft and lively ; he never shook off the shadow of Arthur , but at least we have this document of a career high-point to cherish . * * * from * * * * , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a great movie if viewed in the proper context - It was meant to be a parody of teen-horror-devil-worship movies ( and the ' 80s saw plenty of them ) ! I saw this movie when it first came out , and instantly liked it . Being a big fan of KISS , it was great to see Gene in the movie . And anything with OZZY as a metal-hating preacher can 't be all bad ! Also , Fastway was already a favorite of mine , so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack.The original VHS ( this was pre-DVD ) cover for Trick Or Treat featured an illustration of Sammi kneeling , playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a " " demon " " looking on . It was a special order , and the price for the VHS copy at the time ( circa 1987 ) was $ 90 ! I really wanted the movie , but not at that ridiculous price . The ' OZZY-Gene ' cover was only created for the $ 5 re-release . The company releasing it probably figured Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the movie , so they had better put ' em on the cover ! Same thing with the original " " Little Shop Of Horrors " " - Jack Nicholson was in it for all of five minutes , but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star.I have a " " Trick Or Treat " " web site , and it 's surprising how many people believe Sammi Curr was a real person ! Fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to ' Sammi Curr ' .All-in-all , it was just a good time , rock-n-roll movie . Definitely not to be taken too seriously , but just enjoyed ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Rea , Sutherland , DeMunn , and von Sydow ( in a small role ) are all brilliant in their performances . Sutherland is particularly adept at this sort of role , where he must portray a character whose morality is , at first , uncertain to the audience . As is so often the case with Sutherland 's characters , we must ask " " is he a villian [ in this case , a minor one ] , or a hero ? " " This is a disturbing story , intelligently told , about the incompetence and fearful bureaucracy in the old Soviet Union that impeded the efforts of extremely competent people . As Sutherland 's character wryly notes , " " The measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions " . " The " " committee meeting " " ( between Rea and Sutherland 's characters ) after perestroika is enforced , with its revelations , has enormous emotional impact . You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system.The handful of dramatic scenes portraying victims ' family members adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story . This is seldom a feature of a film with this sickening subject matter , but effectively reminds us that the victims had lives , and were loved.This is a sad , but very important film , which deserved its showcase on Canada 's History Television . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years . I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives . Also we often don 't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs .

" You know , this movie isn 't that great , but , I mean , c 'mon , it 's about angels helping a baseball team . I find the plot line to be hilarious anyways , this kid 's dad says he 'll take him back if the angels win the pennant ( because he knows they won 't ) Kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win , god helps the whole time ( via the angel Christopher Lloyd , RIP ) And in the end , his dad doesn 't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face. it 's hilarious until Danny Glover adopts it and it 's friend.I guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin ' projects and her stories . The real winner here , though , is god . Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows.As a kids movie , it gets a 7 .

" This film is a wonderfully simplistic work . Enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time . The performances from Miranda Otto ( oh , how she deserves so much more recognition ! ) and George del Hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch , as the two tortured souls come to understand each other . The supporting cast of workers at the Dead Letter Office are wonderful bit-parts in them selves , as is Alice 's long-suffering boyfriend , who I couldn 't help but feel slightly sorry for . There 's one particular scene I could watch over and over ( and I have ! ) , it 's such a shame that films like these don 't get recognition , and therefore bring them futher into the public eye for more people to enjoy .

" Garde 횪 Vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub-plots it contains .

You 'll only obtain boredom to death , and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you.Garde 횪 Vue is a wordy film , essentially based upon dialogs ( written by Audiard by the way ) and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances.Why does Ma챤tre Martineau ( Serrault ) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth ? Because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8-years sexual relation .

" What I find remarkable about this terrific film , is that Altman , the crazy and wild guy that he is , took the novel THAT COLD DAY IN THE PARK and the Sandy Dennis character was originally a male in the book . He was a mentally whacked out isolated gay who looked out of his apartment window when he spotted the hustler . It is strange that Altman fans aren 't aware of how clever he was to change the sex of the main character ; thereby avoiding the homo erotic taboos of gay life in the 60 's and actually making Dennis ' reclusive kind of madness work even better in the transposition.If you see the film again , it will be evident how wily the Altman mind works ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I like bad movies . I like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration . Then there are abhorrent movies like this . Redline is not just a bad movie , but a telling sign that maybe the American movie industry should please , for the sake of the viewer , at least proofread scripts before funding a movie.If a stereotype took a crap , this movie would spawn from that . The storyline is unbearable , and the acting all around is laughable . Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have , perhaps , the worst screen chemistry I 've seen in a good while , and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants ( about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for ) . Furthermore , how Angus Macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that I can 't even think of an analogy . I am a loyal fan of his , but this has made me question him.To sum it up . Several people want revenge for different reasons ( and if you care enough to know what they are , you 're a bigger person than me ) , so much so that it turns to violence ( I guess ) . The movie is like Ouroboros , the snake that swallows its own tail , in that it 's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears . This movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half , and an indecipherable action movie for the rest , it should be avoided at any and all costs.I wish I could find one positive aspect to this movie , and I think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll.P.S. Nadia Bjorlin , if that was YOU singing those two songs in this movie , then you are a hack , and I hope old age ravages you.P.S.S. If you DO rent this movie looking for a laughable experience , listen for the lyrics to Nadia Bjorlin 's awesome songs . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Lush cinematography , beautifully written and edited , John Boorman 's Beyond Rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation . It interweaves a personal and political tale that continues to haunt me , popping up in my mind 's eye with frequency . The story line is gripping , and the inner and outer journeys are paralleled carefully and delicately both cinematically , and in the story line .

There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary , David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn , and I could go on and on . The script is fantastic , so funny and sometimes even touching .

" I caught this on IFC last week and I thought it was typical of the indie short subject film : heavy on style , little on substance and originality . Does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive ( and blond to boot ) boy with 70s shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes ? Plus , this film wallows in late 1970s chic , which works for some ( Sofia Coppola 's " " The Virgin Suicides " " comes to mind ) but not for this director.Another reviewer compared this to Harmony Korine 's work and I agree . Yet I don 't view this as a positive thing ( what has HE done lately , anyway ? ) . " " Bobbycrush " " is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved .

" Sidney Franklin 's " " The Good Earth " " has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting , especially from Luis Ranier , who won an Oscar for her portrayal of O-Lan . Rainers performance is so complete , she is nearly unrecognizable . Having very little dialogue throughout the entire film ( and it is a long one ) , Rainer relies instead on facial and body language . She looks and acts Chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as such.The film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it . When Lung and wife O-Lan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty , they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning . It is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts ( the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch ) that they again find fulfillment . A common formula told with the unique perspective of a Chinese family ( especially for 1937 ) makes the film a classic .

I saw this movie on a fluke.I was standing on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this movie.I gave it a chance not expecting much.The promotional movie posters I 've seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all.The movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal.I 'll leave it there.The movie is a heavy comedy and lot 's of fun.If your are old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this film.Jack Black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician.Tenacious D is definitely worth a look ! , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" A refreshing interview with the legendary Italian cinematographer-producer-director who passed away in 1999 with close to 200 features to his credit as director . A large portion is spent on D 'Amato 's softcore sex films including his notorious EMANUELLE entries with Laura Gemser . They also briefly cover his porn career , which kept him afloat during his last decade or so . More interesting to me is the section focusing on his horror and action efforts . D 'Amato has plenty of great anecdotes about actors and his low budget film-making including a story about an assistant accidentally collecting real bones amid the fake ones while shooting in a 2,000-year-old catacomb .

" As I type these comments I 'm watching a DVD of this movie that I just got from a mail-order dealer , and I 'm finding that it holds up extremely well , with strong characterizations , believable situations , and well-staged action scenes.It 's been a good 45 years , maybe 50 , since I saw HELL BELOW , but the one scene that made an extremely deep impression on me was Sterling Holloway 's death scene , which several other commenters have mentioned here . I haven 't gotten to that scene yet on this viewing , but I can vouch for what other comments have said : once you see Sterling Holloway 's death scene in this movie , you will absolutely never , ever forget it . Judging from how strong the film so far is holding up , I fully expect that scene to live up to the memory of it -- as unquestionably one of the greatest death scenes in movie history . The movie 's worth seeing for that moment alone , but even without it , it would be a first-rate early submarine drama . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Initially , I would have thought that Secret Sunshine had something critical to say of religion ( and here being Christianity ) , and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith , or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou . Surprisingly , it was none of the sort and was largely non-judgemental , putting in place events as a matter of fact , and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusion.And I can 't help but to chuckle at the role of Song Kang-ho , a man who 's taken a liking for widower Shin-ae ( Jeong Do-yeon ) , and starts going to church when she does . The reasons for church going are many I suppose , either to find inner peace , to seek help , being afraid of eternal damnation in the fires of Hell , to reaffirm faith , or even things like wanting to get married in a church , or to skirt chase ( I kid you not ) . But to each his own reasons for turning up in church every Sunday and participating in prayer groups for fellowship , what is indeed dangerous , is when the underlying ulterior motives , do not get satisfied , and that 's when frustration sets in . Or when you discover how hypocritical man can be , portraying one face inside the house of God , and displaying yet another outside.Shin-ae and her son Jun moves to the town of Miryang , which is the birthplace of her deceased husband . Wanting to start life anew , she opens up a piano shop to give lessons , though in discovering her new found freedom and in a moment 's lack of good judgement , has another tragedy befall her . And that takes one hour to get to . Secret Sunshine really took its time to get to this point , where things then begin to get slightly more interesting with Shin-ae now taking to embracing religion to deal with and accept her current state , reveling in the comfort that religion , and fellow believers , can offer.What began as crying out for sympathy turns into acceptance and belief that religion offers that silver bullet to solve the ills of all mankind , and sometimes you wonder if it 's because of your personal myopic view of what the almighty is doing for you , that you begin to adopt a somewhat selfish opinion that everything 's good going your way , and in Shin-ae 's case , her magnanimous attitude in wanting to forgive others who had trespassed against her , forgetting something very fundamental that it the feeling can cut both ways too.The last act is probably the most fun of the lot as it says plenty , where most of us can identify with - why me , and why not someone else , as we rage against our faith and start questioning , unfortunately , with no hard and fast answers available . It is then either we fall by the wayside , or continue with destructive deeds so rebelliously . But somehow the plug gets carefully pulled in Secret Sunshine so as not to offend , and what could have been an ugly character mouthpiece , got muted.If you bite into the hype this movie is generating , then perhaps you 'll realize only Jeong Do- yeon 's excellent portrayal is worth mentioning , as she totally owns her role as the widow Shin-ae who is probably the most unluckiest person on Earth in having to deal with that many tragedies over a short period of time , and if you look at it carefully , most of which are of her own doing . Watching her transformation , is worth the ticket price , and despite having my personal favourite Korean actor Song Kang-ho in the movie , this is something he just breezed right through . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" These are excerpts from a nine-page " " Memo to Mr. Cohn from Mr. Welles " , " written after Orson had seen studio mogul Harry Cohn 's edited version of the picture ( he took an hour out ) : " ... " The preview title music was written by a first rate composer , George Antheil . Although not written for our picture at all , this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable ... The only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer ( Heinz Roemheld ) is the rather weary one of using a popular song--the " " theme " " --in as many arrangements as possible . Throughout we have musical references to " " Please Don 't Kiss Me " " for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material . The tune is pleasing , it may do very well on the Hit Parade--but Lady from Shanghai is not a musical comedy ... Mr. Roemheld is an ardent devotee of an old-fashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as " " Disney " . " In other words , if somebody falls down , he makes a " " falling down " " sound in the orchestra , etc . , etc ... If the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative , I couldn 't be unhappier about the results ... Just before I left to go abroad , I asked Vi ( Viola Lawrence , the editor ) to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi-cab and also quite a bit of dialogue . I am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut ... saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence ( this was not done , accounting for the main weaknesses of the film 's opening reel ) ... There is nothing in the fact of Rita 's diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo ... What does matter is Rita 's beauty ... the evil overtones suggested by Grigsby 's character , and Michael 's bewilderment . Any or all of these items might have inspired the music . Instead , the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a Silly Symphony : a pratfall by Pluto the Pup , or a wild jump into space by Donald Duck ... There is no sound atmosphere on the boat . A little wind and water is sorely missed . There 's no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen ... At the start of the picnic sequence ... in the temporary score , we used a very curious , sexy Latin-American strain ... This has been replaced with a corny " " dramatic " " sequel--bad stock stuff ... This sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved Lady from Shanghai from being just another whodunit ... There is a big musical outburst after Grigsby 's line , " " I want you to kill him . " " This is absurd ... The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio ... was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point . As it stands now , it 's on about the same level as the rest of the scoring . Nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we 're kidding ... The aquarium scene needs more echo . " " Please Don 't Kiss Me " " is in again ! ... A bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of Michael 's run down the pier . From the gunshot through to the phone call , a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort . For some reason , this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo . As a result , the whole sequence seems dull ... The audience should feel at this point , along with Michael , that maybe they are going crazy . The new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they 're going to sleep ... The gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music ... The closing music again makes reference to " " Please Don 't Kiss Me " ...

" Just to correct something in a previous review here , I don 't believe this film is only for people who know London , it 's a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments . Jack Rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who , by going though this gruelling Knowledge test , gain some measure of self-knowledge.I think it 's one of the most perfectly-written dramas I 've seen : technically it 's supremely adept at conveying quite complex details but it 's also joyous in how it involves you . At the start you know no more about this London Knowledge test than the main characters but you get scooped up right along with them until it 's vitally important to you . You become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed , and you are crushed for those who don 't . Especially one whose downfall , without giving anything anyway , will make your hands fly to your face.Also just as a point of fact , Nigel Hawthorne 's character , Mr Burgess , is called the Vampire , not Dracula . You don 't need to know this , I 'm not saying it 's crucial , but it 's a measure of the drama : once you 've seen this , you will want everyone to and you will evangelise about its every detail.I hope you get to see it.William , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As I looked at this movie once again , I think it belongs among Hitchcock 's greatest films . The first time I saw it I was just blown away by the suspense , action and imagery . It has the gripping ending , the deranged murderer , the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances , some great on-location shots , e.g. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York . It also has great supporting actors with Hitch 's daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and the stalwart Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movies . The merry-go-round episode near the end is one of the most nerve-wracking in Hitchcock 's body of work.Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony ( his last full film ) gives a great performance as the deranged stranger on the train , who worms himself into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star , Guy Haines ( Farley Granger ) . Granger plays the nice guy who is caught up in a messy divorce . The movie opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men as they leave their taxis to board the train . Eventually , they meet and the story takes over . The stranger takes an unusual interest in the tennis star and as the movie continues , the stranger becomes a stalker . The action shifts from place to place , including Washington , the fictional small town of Metcalf , the Forest Hills tennis championship , and a passenger train taking the two leading men back and forth on separate missions . Towards the end , the pace of a tennis game is woven into the plot as they race against time . The camera cuts away to the faces of the athletes as they volley and serve in a remarkable series of shots . When the closely-fought contest is over , the climactic chase takes place . Hitchcock has a love for trains and it is great to see Penn Station , long since gone . Trains are featured in the 39 Steps , the Lady Vanishes , Shadow of a Doubt , Spellbound , North by Northwest and this movie . This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the start of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense - the 1950 's and I am convinced that one day it will be given its due in the Hitchcock hall of fame . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My 5 year old daughter is very into the Barbie series of movies . I 've had mixed feelings about that - not wanting her to buy into the whole Barbie-doll image of things , and recognizing that the movies are a marketing ploy to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for Mattel . This morning though she asked me to watch this movie with her , and - it being a lazy Saturday morning and with not much else to do - I agreed . I don 't know if the movies have been made to help market the dolls , which seem to be losing their appeal a bit from what I 've heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies ( or , more likely , a bit of both ) but whichever is the case , I have to admit - somewhat to my surprise , this wasn 't half bad.It 's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters ( both good and evil . ) Essentially , Annika ( " " played " " by Barbie ) has to find a way to build a " " wand of light " " to reverse the evil spells of the wizard Wenlock , who among other things has turned her sister into a flying horse and her parents into stone . The animation here was pretty good - not Disney-calibre ( if one thinks of Disney as the standard to aspire to ) but generally pretty good , and while the movie is obviously tailored to young girls rather than middle-aged men , I still found there were enough twists and turns to make me wonder how it was all going to turn out . It 's true that there were some holes in the story , or at least some logical inconsistencies , but again one must remember the target audience , who wouldn 't really think of such things . This is an all around decent family movie . 7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I can 't understand why . Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film ! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town . She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter . Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else , especially when someone tries to kill her . It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does . She hires Samuel L. Jackson , who is a former police officer . Together they form a pair that is as entertaining as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover . When Geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song " " She 's Not There " " playing in the background . What follows is Geena and Samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive . All through the rest of the film Geena has to decide who she really is . The killing unfeeling machine ? The mother / schoolteacher with the quiet family life ? Or a combination of both ? Especially , since the bad guys grab Geena 's daughter . Great action scenes that rank up with any of the Die Hard movies ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Tales from the Crypt : And All Through the House starts on Christmas Eve as Elizabeth ( Mary Ellen Trainor ) kills her husband Joseph ( Marshall Bell ) , she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac ( Larry Drake ) dressed as Santa Clause has escaped from a local mental asylum & has already killed several women with Elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas & tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage ... This Tales from the Crypt story was episode 2 from season 1 , directed by the one of the show 's regular executive producers Robert Zemeckis And All Through the House is a decent enough watch . The script by Fred Dekker was actually based on a story appearing in the comic ' The Vault of Horror ' & was originally adapted to film as one episode from the Britsih horror anthology film Tales from the Crypt ( 1972 ) which starred Joan Collins as the murderous wife character here played by Ellen Trainor . This particular version is good enough but doesn 't do anything different or special & is a bit too linear & predictable to be considered a classic . At only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace , the story is just about macabre enough & it generally provides decent entertainment & I quite liked the downbeat ending . This time there are Christmas themed opening & closing Crypt Keeper ( John Kassir ) segments complete with the usual puns.Director Zemeckis does a good job & there 's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of Christmas influence as well . There 's not much gore here , someone has a poker stuck in their head , someone 's face is cut with an icicle , someone 's arm is cut with an axe & there 's some blood splatter but generally speaking it 's not that graphic . The acting by a small cast is pretty good.And All Through the House isn 't the best tale from the crypt but it 's a decent one all the same , worth a watch but after the comic book story & original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Firstly , I have heard great things about this film , not least among the retro / vintage scene and the stockings lovers who absolutely love Bettie Page and it did not disappoint . Shot in very clean black and white with colour added for key scenes , the film gives a documentary feel to the early life and career of Bettie Page.There are many things I did not know about Page . Firstly , there was the gang rape , later on , there is her early attempts at developing an acting career and then glamour pictures , firstly with a camera club peopled with men who can 't get enough of her and later with the Klaws , Paula and Irving , who despite their taking of bondage and fetish photos , come across as extremely pleasant and friendly people . If only modern pornography producers were like that , perhaps better porn would be a consequence ! For the most part , the film is neither a diatribe against the evils of pornography but an attempt to show the kind of environment that existed in the 1950s for those producing fetish and nude pictures of women . This environment was extremely repressive , perhaps in a good way because it meant that there was none of the ' saturation ' effect that we have today , when it comes to pornography . It also appeared to be much less harsh . Page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and doesn 't appear to be degraded by it . In many of her photos she is seen tied up and gagged ( and trying to hold a conversation ) , brandishing a whip with a flourish , thus exciting the photographers taking her pictures and seen in ' initiation style ' girlie bondage movies which look quite tame compared with the hardcore stuff we have now.Page never became an actress and instead deserted pinup when she was in her thirties for ' Jesus Christ ' . Her belief in God and Jesus never goes away , even when bound and gagged she still insists that she has been given a ' gift ' by God to do ' this thing ' . Seeing this film , I am more knowledgeable about Page and in awe at her modesty , beliefs and demeanour . She is one of a kind , compared with the identi-kit clone blondes we have today and someone who can actually say ' There is life after porn ' . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you have seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or have any interest in seeing the real , non-caricature , " " Real American " " side of America then Riding Giants will hit deeper than anything you 've seen before.This film is " " unreal " , " a facile term if ever there was one , but hugely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it - it is a 100 % factual documentary , but with all the drama of an opera , and the completely apparent sense of love , expert and knowing instilled by Stacy Peralta 's direction and narration , this film expertly leads you from swell to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the privilege of seeing.This film is a symphony , crafted as well as Beethovens 9th , beginning beautifully with its prelude in Hawaii , tugging deeply on human emotion in Santa Cruz and finishing with uproar , triumph and crescendo in Laird Hamiltons feats , again in Hawaii.Like classical music ; like Beethoven 's 9th , Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings , this may be the only piece you like , but it 's worth it .

" I saw this in the early 70s ( when I was 16 ) , and despite the long slow set-up , meetings , riots , etc , once the desert section began all fell into context and I loved it . ( Still do , it has aged very well . ) Back then I was in what seemed to be a tiny minority . All criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative . Happily I 'm no longer in such a minority . It deftly shows ( in a somewhat prophetic way ) the political splintering , unrest , confrontation , brutal repression , commercialisation and deception which lay ahead.Appreciation for this magistral film has grown , and I 'm glad about that . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is one of my favorite series , all categories , all time.I was fortunate enough to get a hold of the whole series on VHS a few years ago . I loved it when I saw it back in -91 -92 , when I was about 12 . I love it as much , or more , today , which is remarkable considering my ( hopefully ) improved film appreciation and criticism skills . Most of the movies I liked back then I 'm not that fond of today , besides for the nostalgia factor . That factor is present here as well , but there 's so much more to Robin of Sherwood than nostalgia.There are only a few bad things about this series . First , the picture and sound quality is so-so , at least in the first couple of episodes . Fortunately , it gets better . Secondly , you could have wished for a bit more blood and realism in the fighting scenes , although I know that was not an option in this case.So , on to the good things ! And there are a lot of them . First of all , Michael Praed IS Robin Hood . I don 't think I have seen him in a single role since then , which only strengthen this fact for me . He delivers such a believable performance as Robin . Jason Connery had an impossible task replacing him . The fact that Michael Praed hasn 't become a bigger name as an actor is unbelievable . Or perhaps that was his fate , to do this one role perfectly , then disappear.I love Nickolas Graces Sheriff of Nottingham . He is really not a complex character , but totally rotten . The relation between him and Gisburne is just hilarious . Actually , just looking at de Rainault sitting in his throne , bored , glaring , makes me laugh even before he has said anything . Another actor that deserves extra praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet . You can really feel the sadness inside of him as well as his hate for the soldiers who killed his wife . Winstone is an actor that finally has gotten his well deserved Hollywood breakthrough ( in films as The Departed and Beowulf ) . There are a lot of other great actors here , too.I love the portrayal of the Robin gang . They are having fun , playing , laughing , you really get a feel of the camaraderie between them , the closeness that comes from a tight bound group such as this . Those bonding scenes are so important.I think that it being UK produced with British actors really made it better , compared to for example the -92 feature film version with Kevin Costner , that just feels fake , fake , fake . ( Christian Slater as Will Scarlet , come on .. ) The cast being able to speak English with British accent makes it more believable , and I get the feeling that the actors , as well as the director and writers , behind the series can put themselves much more into the shoes of the Robin Hood gang than an American crew could have . The music is wonderful , Clannad is perfect for the feel of the series . The music is another of those things they just nailed.An exciting addition also is the fantasy and magic spice that is put in there . It 's not over the top , but believable and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting . I also love how nicely the mix of comedy , adventure and drama is blended.Those are a few of the things that makes this series so alive and so genuine . It 's by far the best Robin Hood version I have ever seen . I won 't wrap up with the " " Nothing 's forgotten " " quote . But one thing that never will be forgotten , for me , is this fantastic Robin Hood retelling . See it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office , this remake actually turns out to be better than the original . Douglas Fairbanks , Jr . , is horribly miscast as a pugilist . John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals . Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM . Berkeley does do a fine job here , keeping the action flowing at a good pace . I particularly like the scene where four of the Dead End Kids and Garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down . They get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity.Other performances besides Garfield and the kids to remember are May Robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and Claude Rains as the obsessed detective on Garfield 's trail . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Fragile Carne , just before his great period . Although it is sometimes hesitantly directed , and marred by longueurs , HOTEL DU NORD is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of French films of the late 1930s , as well as a relative lightness of touch unusual with this director . All of his great virtues are here : the cramped interiors broken up by gliding , complex , delicious camera movements ; a melancholy deployment of light and shade ; remarkable , wistful sets by Alexander Trauner , which are so evocative that they , as the title suggests , take on a shaping personality of their own ; the quietly mournful music of Maurice Jaubert ; a seemingly casual plot about romance , tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters ; extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time , in this case Louis Jouvet and Arletty.In fact , the film 's biggest failing , and I find myself astonished ( as someone who usually , didactically , minimises its importance ) to admit it , is its script . It has plenty of wit and poignancy , but without the poetry and irony regular Carne collaborator Jacques Prevert brought to their best films , it cannot avoid slipping into cliche ( even if it is only cliche in hindsight ) .Ostensibly set in the boarding house , the film sets up its opening idea of community with two interconnecting tales of doomed love , and emotional , metaphysical and actual isolation The doomed love scenario is the one that works least well . Annabella is very beautiful , but not very good at doing tragic , while Aumont 's callowness , brilliantly appropriate though it may be , by its nature obtrudes any real , felt , romance . Maybe it 's just me , but I find it hard to sympathise with a couple , so young , so attractive , who , after only a few months , are so racked with despair that they have to shoot each other . Their high-flown lines are rather embarrassing too . Of course , this affair is not meant to be plausible - they are symbolic of youth , hope and possibility being crushed in France , or maybe France itself , despairing , resigned , waiting for death . For symbols to be truly powerful , they must convince on a narrative level , which , I feel , they don 't quite here.What saves this plot is its connection with the story of M. Edmond , a character linked to the great tradition of French gangsters . Although we only learn it gradually , he is a killer in hiding , living off the prostitute played by Arletty , having dobbed in his accomplices . In his previous ' role ' - and the theatricality of his position is crucial - he had one set of traits ; in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite . Living a rather aimless life , he is profoundly shaken by the lovers ' pact , and becomes fatalistic , realising the folly of trying to cheat death.In this way - the admission that one is less a person than a collection of signs , and that death is an unavoidable reality the most powerful masculinity must succumb to - Edmond is like a romantic prototype of Melville 's clinical killers . With one exception - he gives briefly into hope , a delusion which only strenghtens - if that 's not too much of an unbearable irony - his fatal resolve.All this could have been trite if it wasn 't for the truly amazing performance of Louis Jouvet . I had studied his theatrical work at college , but this was my first taste of his screen talents , and he reveals himself to be worthy of the greats - Grant , Mastroianni , Clift , Mason , Mitchum , Cotten - giving a quiet nobility to a role which is more of a conception ( he , needless to say , is allegorical too ) than an actual person . Edmond begins the film a minor supporting character , but emerges as a tragic hero of some force . Like all those major actors , Jouvet 's brilliance lies in what he conceals.On a formal level , what amazes is Carne 's grasping , ten years before its flourishing , of the techniques of the great Hollywood melodramas of Sirk , Ophuls , Ray and Minnelli . Although his theatricality lacks the fluidity and clear-eyed beauty of Sierck 's contemporary German melodramas ( check out the masterpieces ZU NEUEN UFERN and LA HABENERA ) , Carne 's style truly fits his theme - that of entrapment , paralysis , resignation.The film 's principle motif is that of water - the credits float and dissolve , the hotel stands by a waterway - but instead of Renoir 's open river of possibility , we have a canal , stagnant and manmade , going nowhere . The film begins as it ends , and the setting never changes , except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return . Characters can only escape through death - their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy , the walls and frames that hold them captive , the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve . Any hope at the end , therefore , is profoundly , if romantically , compromised . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I had to fast forward quite a number of scenes.If it is just entertainment you are looking for , then this movie has it all . The songs are catchy . A lavish production , I must add.However , the message of the movie is not universal . It emphasizes on the idea of karma . That is , if you do good , you will get good . And if you do evil , you will get evil . The fruit of good deeds is good , while the fruit of evil is evil . In real life , this is not always true . It is well-known that most people do not get justice in this world . While it is true that some evil people do meet with an evil end , there are many who escape . And then , there are many people who do good , and yet in return they meet with a sorry end.If you don 't care about the message , and all you want is an escape from worldly reality , this movie is an entertainer alright . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Who would 've imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style . The fusion is highly entertaining.Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade , I approached this one with some caution . His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog . The director 's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island , New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a " " spy thriller " . " To my pleasant surprise , Hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue . It works in more ways than one might imagine . Hartley 's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks , along with a singular cinematographic style.Moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides . Hartley has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana . Truly he is coming into his own . The cast does a fine job of interpreting Hartley 's vision and style . Fans of Parker Posey will see her in full bloom here , still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Generally I like horror movies , but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand . We sat down to watch it , ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much . The concept isn 't that bad , but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky I don 't know . The worst thing about the movie is the actors . The camera work was poor , the special effects are actually not bad if I am being generous , but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm . They were wooden beyond measure , especially a foppish young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent . He looked more like a public school boy in fact . There was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later his nappy sized underpants were hysterical , but then I remembered it wasn 't supposed to be a comedy . I 'm desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts , but there simply isn 't .

It is particularly a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and , of course , to Jean Renoir father , Pierre-Auguste .

" The stark , cold landscape of Big Sky Country , with its majestic snow-capped mountains juxtaposed to barren plains , is put to poetic use here in this Lynchian fable / slide picture show about death and melancholy from the young and talented Polish Brothers ( who previously treated indie movie fans to the bizarre and fascinating " " Twin Falls Idaho " " --a film about a young woman falling in love with two brothers who happen to be Siamese twins ) . A little orphan boy is dying , and a town is about to flooded in the name of progress ( in the form a damn and hydroelectric power plant ) . With its eerily pleasing music score , minimalist dialogue and character development , and uncanny fantasy sequences involving some very unique angels , the Polish brothers put their focus on what every good film artist knows a film should be about , the moving pictures ... the images , the scenes ... paintings of deep beauty captured on celluloid . This is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can linger in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep . The fact that all of this was done on a shoe-string budget of less than two million dollars puts Hollywood with their bloated film costs and hollow movies to shame and indicates something grand to come from the Polish brothers in the future . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Hal Hartley entry into a European film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date , and , lucklily , one of the few available on DVD . At only 63 minutes running time , my only quibble would be with Hartley I always leave wanting more , but never so much as this time . Martin Donovan is astonishing as Jesus . PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting as Magdelena , but the high point for me was Thomas Jay Ryan ( Henry Fool ) as Satan . Hartley gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resounding voice to full effect . Look for three scenes in which a microphone awaits him , as if a poetry slam is about to be won by the devil . I have read other comments on this film and had to add mine because there is not enough praise going around . If you like Henry Fool , Martin Donovan in anything ( Opposite of Sex ) , and / or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas , get this as quickly as possible . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

As the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other , the laughs come thick and fast , before Felix departs , leaving Oscar a changed and more cleanly individual.Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic , cleaning obsessed divorcee coping with life as a single man . Walter Matthau in contrast to Lemmon 's character is equally as good as the slobbish sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefits.Lemmon and Matthau are magnificant in their selected parts , to some degree dependent upon the beautiful script by Neil Simon , and simultaneously because they work well as a team . As two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles , although similar in relationships with ex-wives and children , these two , late , great actors create a partnership which is practically impossible to recreate . So great in fact , that the world screamed out so much for something similar , that two years before Matthau 's death and three before Lemmon 's , the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel . This idea , whilst following Hollywood 's irritating obsession with sequels , might have worked to a certain degree , but at the same time , it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original film.Ultimately it 's not really possible to say anything else . With Simon 's amazing script , filled with humour and laughter , the creators of this film were already onto a hit . The casting of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison though , is the most important part of this film . " " The Odd Couple " , " with it 's traditional soundtrack ( which even gained a tribute in " " The Simpsons " " ) , it 's excellent script and it 's genius leading men , is a tribute to cinema and a feature for history to remember . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" SPOILER ALERT ! Don 't read on unless you 're prepared for some spoilers.I think this film had a lot beneath its shell . Besides the apparent connections with " " Oldboy " " ( and Park-wook 's other films ) , an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me , and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric , physical action.The main actor , Kang-ho Song , is terrific in the r척le of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally , " " sang " " means " " blood " " in some languages - who truly loved Tae-ju , played by OK-bin Kim . Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in " " Badlands " , " where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger.Their relationship is one thing , but the girl 's mother is entirely different . While moving , she is stiff , one-dimensional and taut , but paralysed , she says all through not moving , or through the wink of an eye.Park-wook has really , really mastered his cinematography in this film , and owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick ; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film , some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.The music is quite stock , using mostly strings to accompany the main thespian 's monoreaction ; it 's a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is . While he does very little and loses at that , he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot . While his love-interest says and does a lot , her actions display very little thought behind it . In my humble opinion.All in all , a very disturbing film that is not made for action , which isn 't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days ; it 's magnificent , and repellant at the same time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of the best , Lackawanna BluesGreat movie , great cast , great music , this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes , I will w3atch this one many times . This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature . The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role . You get the sense that you 're really there taking all this in . A great deal of care was given in the sets , costumes and music of the period . The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on , but the steady performance of Ms. Merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before we 've had our fill of the wonderful misfits . To single out anyone other than " " Nanny " " is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including : Jeffery Wright , Jimmy Smits , Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo . But it is Marcus Franklin , Macy Gray and Ms. Merkerson that makes this a wonderful experience.The movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards , but it is without question one of the best movies you 're going to see this year . If you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally , tug at your heart , lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time , then this is the movie for you . I 've shown it to several friends and they all want my copy , that says it all , the movie is that good . Check it out for yourself.danceability-1 , Amsterdam Holland , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of the best films made about the 80 punk scene . I saw this a few years back on a " " bootleg " " copy and was amazed . Very few of todays kids know the true roots of punk and this movie shows some of the 80s punk legends such as The Germs and shows how it was back then . Nowadays so much punk has gone mainstream with MTV and radio and its nice to see the true underground rebellious movement of the original scene . Darby Crash ( of The Germs ) is one of my heros and this film shows why . A must see for all " " punks " " and anyone curious about the 80s punk scene , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This was it ! i would have never expected the ending if i didn 't already know the behind the scenes stuff.The one thing that i hated was that why was Shannon kicked off and not Alyssa. i hate her i would rather her character die that Shannon 's. what was funny is that in the scene where piper is dieing on the hospital bed and Prue was crying by her side i started crying too lol. at the time that this aired i was about 10yo and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning so i was saying to myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore ! lolthen the whole go back in time thing was a shocker and really good. i also blame Pheobe for Prue 's death because instead of being with her sisters she had to be a slutty bi * * * and be with her good for nothing demon boyfriend.but i think this episode will be now and forever one of my favorites and a CHRMED classic.FOREVER CHARMED !

" A huge cast gathered for this remake which sadly was a box office failure notwithstanding a great sound track . I can 't say it was riveting entertainment , nor a cure for insomnia . Nevertheless I enjoyed the film - it provided the escape I was after one afternoon . A good look for those of us looking for the ideal life , albeit a fantasy . Expect some corny moments , few thrills , and an occasional laugh . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The sequel to the ever popular Cinderella story reminded me somewhat of what they did with one of the Beauty & the Beast movies . It 's basically three short stories rolled into 1.OK , the mice are adorable ( I love Gus ! He 's sooo cute ! ) , and Lucifer 's awesome ( as usual ) . I liked some of the newer characters as well , ( Pom Pom was adorable and I did like Prudence . ) . Still , the storyline was somewhat limited , but still very cute .

" Since September of last year , I have been borrowing four to six films each week from the Harold Washington Library , which boasts an impressive DVD collection . ( The HWL truly is a circulating library : three-quarters of its films are out at any given time ! ) Recently , I was thrilled to find The Short Films of David Lynch . Yesterday , knowing little about the animated series , I picked up Dumbland . I 'm here to report that , for David Lynch fans , watching the eight episodes is half an hour well-spent.The most remarkable feature of these brief pieces are their soundtracks . Each episode has its own rhythm . Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion . Outrageous voices accent pauses ' ends . Physical violence supplies the beats . Chirping birds and buzzing sockets brush along the edges . Many other elements fill out the orchestra . The pacing of the crude animation often keeps in sync with the sound , but the soundtrack itself struck me as Lynch 's primary interest in creating and disseminating this work . In a way , these eight shorts are unique Lynchian rhythms.That said , the situations are odd , ugly , profound , dumb and funny as hell . And there 's enough space within them to reflect on how absurd we humans can be . I can 't say that I 'll watch the collection again , but for anyone who revelled in the movements that is the suite Inland Empire , Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Finally got to see this classic TV movie on an unofficial disc recorded from an old VHS , it is a classic piece of horror . Its a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS ... the TV horror movie . Recommended for all fans of the 70 's TV movie much like trilogy of terror . Those interested should get the book on the subject by David Deal - Television Fright Films of the 70 's . Email me for a chance to see it ..... its fabulous to see it again.It does have it problems like many TV movies they have to be rather inventive in the effects dept and even at 70 mins it can seem to drag possibly we are all used to more modern editing but still great stuff and far better than many theatrical frights released today . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Toy Soldiers ' is the story of five misfits boys ( most noteably being Sean Astin , Wil Wheaton , and Kieth Coogan ) attempt to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the American government imprisons the leader 's father . Lou Gosset Jr. plays the headmaster of the school , a headstrong guy who tries to instill in his students a sense of discipline . ' Toy Soldiers ' is a funny and pretty cool action , and certainly the better of hostage-crisis-at-school movies . I think most of the appeal comes from the teen cast , but also , the terrorists don 't come off as completely useless whereas in some movies , they never seem to be quite the intimidating group that they should . Trapped inside the boarding school , and threatened to be killed if the military or police interferes , this is a very formidable challenge for these group of guys who plan to save the school . They 're actually pretty clever about it , too.I was surprised that it was a pretty good movie . It keeps a steady pace and doesn 't get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that . Astin and Gosset Jr. give good performances . I , too , agree that this is an underrated action movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out . It has this freakish feel to it . Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you . It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies . What does push to such a high level is the : The directing was spectacular here . Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie . Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war . Most others just display and show you the horrors of war . Coppola though makes you feel confused , shocked and scared . These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story . This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film . The writing was of course amazing too . It brought you write into the middle of the movie . It never made me bored and this movie is three hours . The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm.The acting was bone-chilling . Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded , out of whack colonel . When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now . With Brando n this film you don 't want to look into his eyes . Like the movie he was freakish . To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather . Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal . It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations . Robert Duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies , among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming . Also Duvall 's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable . Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne , Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a clich챕 . Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both love.I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie . It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best . There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting , directing , writing , cinematography and great ending . Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it . I 'm a student of screen writing and I loved the way the minor characters intervened just when something pivotal / climatic happened in a scene . I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of story is rather shocking - at one particular point Barbara Stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter 's boyfriend ; AND rekindling some passion in her husband whom she hasn 't seen in ten years ; AND with the gunshot signal ' two shots and then one ' she hooks up with her old shag mate Dutch ( the reason she left town in the first place ! ) ALL AT THE SAME TIME ! The moral majority must have been totally incensed when they saw this flick back in the 50 's.Love the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue - just to watch Barbara Stanwyck and Co doing the ' Bunny Hug ' is good enough reason to rent this film on DVD.One of the best films from that period I 've seen in a long time . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Jean Paget , Joe Harman , and Noel Strachan--all are unlikely heroes and survivors . Petite but strong Jean whose strength and resolve help save lives , marching hundreds of miles and with calm self-discipline and persuasive powers , Joe Harman ( " " oh my word " " ) who took risks for Jean and the other prisoners , only to suffer the worst pain imaginable , and Noel Strahan , who trusted Jean regardless of the odds . Her good humor and hardiness inspire everyone around her , and those with the courage to go in with her are rewarded . The beautiful scenery and musical score adds to the adventure . Despite the length it was never boring to me . These ordinary people did extraordinary things and it is based on a true story .

One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams playing herself . When she snubs Tammy at the dry cleaners , Tammy finds a picture of Cindy Williams in her coat . The picture is of Cindy Williams doing an unmentionable act with a bowling pin-upside down . It is awesome to see an actress like Cindy Williams being able to play herself like this .

" I saw this movie in part because of some positive comments here on IMDb . After wishing I had those 90 minutes of my life back , I feel it 's my duty to get on here myself and say ... Please don 't bother watching this movie.I can 't argue with the actors efforts - they did what they could given the material , but that material is dreadful . The pace was deadly - slow , meandering , and you saw everything coming about an hour away , and then it took forever to happen . The dialogue was boring , pointless , not funny at all . The characters were all completely unsympathetic . And the cinematography was , in my opinion , very low quality - the clich챕 of " " character uses home video machine ! " " was used to very bad effect.Yes , Jeri Ryan is a cool person . Don 't let that sucker you into wasting your time on this film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" 6 out of the 8 comments on this subject rated this film as worth watching , so let me redress the balance.If this is the best that British Independent film makers have to offer then they need to pack away their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry . Unfortunately for me that was 82 minutes I 'll never see again and hopefully I 'll save some of you from wasting 82 minutes of your own . Whilst the idea behind the film is interesting , it is not developed enough to keep the viewer attached . The student characters are bland and uninteresting and quite frankly you won 't care about what happens to them . The soldiers are practically caricatures of every baddie ever seen in film , I kept waiting for Captain Markovic to twirl an imaginary moustache . Some of the effects were quite good and showed some imagination , but these were ruined by the shockingly bad acting , poor script writing and patchy camera work . The budget may have been better spent sending the " " actors " " ( and I use that term loosely ) to acting classes or the Thomas Brothers to film making school or maybe on a spell checker because the subtitles were incorrectly spelt . The fact that the mis-spellings were not picked up on and rectified speaks volumes about the immaturity of the whole production.I can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the film makers , either that or they were watching a completely different film . I implore the Thomas Brothers to never give up their day jobs for if they continue in this field , they will surely starve to death . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" i hate vampire movies. with that said , this one was very interesting to me. i do want to point out one thing tho . " " bakjwi " " literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories , you see count Dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva . We also know that bats are mammals that can fly thus many categorizes them to be " " exceptional . " " As I watched the film , I realized that the theme of bat is deeply embedded in this movie more than just to make the bat-vampire connection.Duality of human nature = if you ever read aesop 's fables , there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can 't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage . Mammals and birds find out what this bat has been doing and banish the bat out of their lands at the end of the story.the two contradicting sides of human nature are constantly at battle throughout the film ex. sang-hyun 's blind priest friend , sang-hyun 's effort to quench thirst and his sexual desire , tae-ju playing both sides , her ordinary boring life vs. her thrill seeking vampire adventure , etc ( won 't ruin too much , u have to watch the film ) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance , sex , violence , religion , dark-comedy , tragedy , vengeance , you name it ! i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long , but this film is very fresh and new , something that i haven 't seen b4 yet . I wouldn 't say this is CW Park 's best work , but it is mos. def. the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a Welles box set I had recently purchased . A box set I chiefly got because I wanted to own A Man For All Seasons and to also re-evaluate Waterloo . So I stick Orson and Rita in the player and I 'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure.On the surface the story seemed a simple one , man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs , they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband , and then ............... well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans . Michael O 'Hara ( Orson Welles } himself doesn 't really know what is going on , he is as confused as the viewer is , and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film . Obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as Elsa Bannister ( Rita Hayworth } has its moments , but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped.So many wonderful things in the film , it has Welles visual style all over it , see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye . The narration from O 'Hara is joyously self mocking , and we get good light relief by way of a court case with Everett Sloane considerably lighting up proceedings.Yet the film is an oddity , and in fact it 's a choppy viewing experience , because { as I was to find out after } studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour , and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer , but unfair on Welles ' vision . I 'm positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale , as it is tho , we have a very good and intriguing film , one that sadly only hints at greatness , but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that I 'm glad I own to revisit further . 8.5 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" David Suchet is Agatha Christie 's mustached detective Hercule Poirot in " " After the Funeral , " " produced in 2005 . Anyone who has heard David Suchet speak with his own British accent knows what a shock it is , because his accent as Poirot is so perfect and organic to the character . Suchet is the Poirot of Agatha Christie 's books , and although I confess a love for Peter Ustinov in the role , his portrayal doesn 't have that much to do with what Christie wrote.In this episode , Poirot is asked by a solicitor friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients . Enroute on the train , the solicitor recounts the events after the death - a strange will disinheriting the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man 's sister that he was murdered . When Poirot meets the family , he discovers adultery , lots of secrets , another will and murder.The story is excellent with rich production values and a wonderful , detailed depiction of the time period . All of the acting is superb , particularly from Monica Dolan , who plays Miss Gilchrist . Poirot here is without Hastings , his beautiful office , or Miss Lemon but he 's effective nonetheless.I had the privilege of seeing David Suchet on Broadway in " " Amadeus . " " Breathtaking .

" I recently watched this , but when it started I had no idea what the concept was about , what the topic was ..... in short - I had no idea what it was . Was it a documentary , was it a comedy routine ..... Well , it was BOTH.It started a little slow , but I think that 's because I had absolutely no idea what type of program I was viewing . But it quickly sucked me in . The episode I watched had Robert Wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history . Mainly how we ( american 's ) learn history that isn 't really true - and how we got to learn what we did . He did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained , and interested . I actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be.I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO .

" I have seen this movie twice now on cable . The first time I saw it , it caught me by suprise .

I am glad that a film was finally made that gives an accurate account of how it all came to be . I am almost 40 years old now and I guess a pretty uptight kind of guy with all of life 's problems , however ; this film did a great job of taking me back .

" I don 't like " " grade inflation " " but I just had to give this a 10 . I can 't think of anything I didn 't like about it . I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it . I 'm sure that the Hollywood remake that someone told me about , with J Lo and Richard Gear , will be excellent , but this original Japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me that I am hard-pressed to think of any way that it could be improved , or its setting changed to a different culture.A story I found worth watching , and with o fist-fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort ! Imagine that ! All the characters seemed well-developed , ... even non-primary characters had good character-development and enjoyable acting , and the casting seemed very appropriate . It 's always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age , and perhaps this doesn 't quite qualify ( there is plenty of learning how to dance , but no singing ) but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man , successful with a family in Japan , looking for something ... he knows not precisely what.To the team of people in Japan who contributed to this film , thank you for creating and doing it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Bride of Chucky " " is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90 's . * * SPOILERS * * Chucky 's girlfriend , Tiffany ( Jennifer Tilly ) manages to find his battered remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and brings him to life in her trailer park . Her neighbor , Jessie ( Nick Stabile ) and his girlfriend Jade ( Katherine Heigl ) are being tormented by her uncle . ( John Ritter ) Tiffany upsets Chucky when he refuses to marry her , so she buys a doll for him to play with . Chucky kills Tiffany , and then transfers her soul into the doll she got him . In order for them to be placed back into human bodies , they have to travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so . Jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from Ritter , and they set out on the journey , but not before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany . Along the way , several bizarre incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast . When several more people are killed , they call up their best friend ( Gordon Woolvett ) to straighten out the situation . They convince him neither one of them are the killers , as the police have began to solve the crimes . He finds Ritter 's body in a trunk in the back of the van . Thinking he has been set up , he confronts them about it . Chucky and Tiffany then turn real to prove they did it , which gets Woolvett killed . The group steals a motor home and arrives at the cemetery . Jessie and Jade get Chucky and Tiffany to turn on each other , giving them enough to escape . Chucky recaptures Jade and forces her to get his amulet . Chucky and Tiffany restart their feud , which gives Jessie and Jade enough time to kill the both of them as the police arrive and clears them of the crimes.The Good News : I have to give the most amount of props to the FX department , as Chucky and Tiffany as dolls look completely convincing . The scenes with them together are the movies main highlights , including a hilarious conversation where Tiffany advises Chucky on how serial killers in the 90 's work . That being said , the amount of one-liners in this movie that are actually funny is incredible . Chucky gets the most of them , but Tiffany cracks a few gems as well . It is actually funnier than what Hollywood calls comedies these days . The gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic . Several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative . Turning Ritter into a new form of Pinhead was a totally brilliant scene . The honeymooning couple was a nice death scene , as well . For teenage love , the pairing of Stabile and Heigl works great . They have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple . I also have to admit that the first time I saw this movie , I did jump during certain scenes , and that shows what an incredible job director Yu did . He learned enough , apparently , to do the same thing with " " Freddy vs. Jason . " " He knows how to stage set-ups and pay-offs , and here he shows some great skills that have a Hong Kong influenced look and style . He could be the next great horror director if he keeps filling up his resume with films like those two . Nice soundtrack , too , like " " Freddy vs. Jason . " " The Bad News : For fans of cheesy movies , this will be a great find . However , this film has a high cheese factor that may prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this film . The film knows it is a cheesy movie and revels in it , making a serious fan turned off because of things like the one-liners . It isn 't all that bad of a movie , but it has to be watched in the mind frame that it is a cheesy movie , and that the cheesiness of certain scenes add to the movie , not to take it away . Remove yourself from that state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this movie.The Final Verdict : Fans of cheesy movies and the other " " Child 's Play " " movies will find a lot to like about this movie . For serious horror fans , take a look at it , but keep in mind that it isn 't a serious movie and that the cheesiness is supposed to be there and you might find yourself liking it.Rated R : Graphic Violence , Graphic Language , Brief Nudity on a doll , a shadowy puppet sex scene , some drug use , and numerous drug references . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I first saw this movie in a theater in France a year or so ago . It came and went with little fanfare , but I enjoyed it for the beauty of the landscape photography and the fascinating wildlife footage . ( The story , while nice , is really incidental . If you actually thought about it , there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life . ) I just saw it again tonight , here in the States , on DVD . Again , I gather it has very limited distribution . Blockbusters only had one copy of it , and I don 't recall it ever playing in the art houses in Cleveland.Seen on my TV , the photography is not as breathtaking , though it is still very beautiful . The wildlife footage is still fascinating . The story of the relationship between the 10-year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around , when you know where it 's headed.Still , as I said , the story is incidental . It 's a beautiful film to watch , and if you like wildlife footage , you should find this fascinating . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Mark Walhberg in a great role , idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs , imitating him to perfection , and dressing like him . When the opportunity comes for him to take over his " " idol 's " " role in the band , he jumps at the opportunity . However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be ... and relationships can change .... This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it . Overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads , Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston . It did make me feel sad , especially when Emily , ( Jennifer Aniston ) , met up with Chris in Seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk . If anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle , although glamourous for a while , is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is not what it appears to be . Clint Eastwood is not Dirty Harry or a " " cowboy " " here . The movie 's appeal comes from its careful manipulation of atmosphere and theme . It 's a Gothic tale set in the Civil War and as such all the film 's " " action " , " or lack thereof , takes place inside a house populated by Southern Belles of all ages and shapes.The horror comes from viewing the whole story through the eyes of the Clint Eastwood character . Seeing him stranded in the house and held captive by the women is a very " " beguiling " " experience indeed . And who is " " beguiled " " here exactly ? Are the women beguiled by Eastwood 's incredible looks ? Are we , the viewers , beguiled by both his sexual allure and the potential deviant sexualities it unleashes ? Or does " " beguiled " " refer to what the director does here-- holds us enthralled for a short space only to ( maybe ) let us go ? Don Siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing films I had the pleasure of watching . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" All of the people reviewing this film , and probably many professional film reviewers , just don 't get it . This film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great Czech filmmaker , Karel Zeman . If you want to know what I 'm talking about , I suggest you get any of Zeman 's films , such as The Fabulous World of Jules Verne , Baron Munchausen , Journey to the Beginning of Time , or On The Comet . If you are unable to locate a film , then read the reviews in AMG . They will explain the processes used . If one were to look at Zeman 's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci / fi fantasy films of the time , viewers probably wouldn 't have gotten it then either . It is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers ' styles to the standard technologies of the day , because both Zemen and Hines " " do not compute " . " They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only . If you look at this film from a perspective where you KNOW that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action , you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job . It isn 't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow . I thought that the creatures were also quite good , also considering how they were made . Hines took a great gamble , and I think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come . Someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing , rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual CG work . Regarding the actors , I think Hines also took a page from Zemen 's book , in that many of Zemen 's actors were somewhat expressionless at first , but became much more engaging as the film and action went on . It is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library . I will watch it for years to come , all three great hours of it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Nobi " " or " " Fires On the Plain " " is a film that is so excellent on so many levels , that not enough good things can be said about it . My only regret is that I was not able to see this 1959 film sooner.Being something of a film purist , I tend to look at films for their artistic merits based upon dialog , acting , photography and even the efforts to remain true to the period in terms of costume . Ultimately , I want to know if the film is " " truthful " " enough in revealing the human condition to make me think without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think . " " Fires on the Plain " " is a great film because it crafts a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe.Ichikawa 's film is a condemnation of war on all levels -- as any good war film should be . War is horrifying , bloody , destructive . It is also murderous on the psyche . However , what is fundamental about " " Fires on the Plain " " is its unapologetic look at the Japanese soldiers . It shows them slowly collapsing under the weight of superior American firepower and their nation 's inability to wage a war of its own making . A fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is at the heart of this madness.I was astonished to see such an honest and brutally close look at the bitter fruits of Japan 's military misadventure made just 14 years after the end of what the Japanese call the " " Great Pacific War . " " Ichikawa , reveals what the Germans called the " " war life , " " the plight of the common soldier.Ichikawa 's film is interesting , since even today Japan is having a hard time fully coming to terms with its wartime fanaticism , its subjugation of conquered peoples , the racism of its war against the Chinese and war crimes which included cannibalism by soldiers and officers practiced not only against one another , but against Allied prisoners of war.Ichikawa produces a stark representation of the victimization of soldiers by a confluence of bad political decisions and cultural pressures.This stark examination is skillfully done by portraying the doomed soldiers as human beings who exhibit , at various times , fear , brilliantly laconic humor , dialog enriched by its sparseness , and a plot whose complexity is belied by the grim , wilderness setting.Ichikawa 's portrait is a ragged and painful tapestry of defeated men . The tubercular Tamura , played as a woebegone and gentle soul by Eiji Funakoshi , is a good soldier who can 't abandon his humanity , though he is as frightened and lost as his comrades . Before he departs for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy , Tamura is given a hand grenade by a superior who , recognizing the hopelessness of their situation , advises Tamura to kill himself.Why Tamura 's hopelessly ill-supplied and militarily incapable unit was not ordered to surrender at the start of the film is telling . Ichikawa makes it plain that the war is over and everyone is merely waiting to die . As Tamura leaves his unit for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation , he sees his comrades pointlessly digging an air raid shelter . They appear like corpses looking up from their own mass grave.We later watch as the overworked hospital 's medical staff abandons the dying patients to an all-consuming American artillery barrage . The pathetic patients , who crawl from their huts in a vain attempt to survive , appear like pathetic , serpentine creatures dragging themselves from an omnipotent force . You know they won 't survive.Ichikawa makes it plain that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its comrades . As Tamura staggers through the jungles of Leyte we encounter the noble , the dying and the exploitive . Cannibalism rears its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat one another rather than surrender to American " " corned beef . " " When the men do talk of surrender , the propaganda of how Americans kills prisoners is countered by a worldly-wise soldier who reveals that the approaching Americans feed and care for prisoners of war because they , unlike the Japanese , respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up.It is the Japanese who intend to die fighting for the Emperor long after resistance has lost all meaning . Those willing to fight to the death will be killed . It is the calculus of war.After shooting a murderous and cannibalistic comrade , whom he earlier offered his own body to as food , the fatalistic Tamura 's careless surrender also seems to be an intentional form of suicide . His death is a lonely image . Was Ichikawa trying to tell us of the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live , but who is still trapped by his nation 's suicidal cultural codes ? If someone watches this film carefully , he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism is the enemy . The Americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people willing to employ that technology in the form of inexorable military power -- a lesson that transformed Japanese postwar society . Ichikawa 's film isn 't so shallow that it indicts America . Ichikawa indicts the sedimentary layers of Japan 's destructive policies that created the war and then to continue it when all was lost.Ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons dropped upon Nagasaki and Hiroshima . He doesn 't have to . The slow-motion destruction of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of Japan 's immolation . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Recently when i was shopping , i saw the box-set of Americian Gothic , and i thought ' I remember that ! ' I used to set my alarm to get back up & watch this when it was on CH 4 in 1996 at 1.30am ( i was 14 ) . I remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird , no person could ever be as frightening as Lucas Buck ( with a B ! ! ) No one ever was anyway . What annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the box-set as when on TV . Episodes in funny order , I kept thinking when does Dr Matt leave ? ? ? - they made it so confusing . However this is not the writers , producers or directors fault ( its TV people in background the money makers They still do the same - Just look at shows like Carnivale and Farscape they don 't like originality in studios ! ! ! ! ! ) To finish - If you 've not seen this and you call yourself a Sci-Fi Fantasy , Horror , supernatural drama ..

" Not many reviews , hence thought i would add one.DO NOT GO BY THE OTHER REVIEWS ! This was a excellent movie.RKS is one of the very few Indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie.AB and Akshay given yet another example of great acting , as does bhoomika too , which was a little unexpected , but great to watch.Am surprised there has not been much hype around release.Or filmfare / other awards nominations , considering how good the movie was.Better then Khakee i thought and i thought Khakkee too was good movie.Is a fairly long movie , but definitely worth it and while watching it , definitely does seem long.Cant wait for RKS next movie and the next AB , Akshay movie they always seem to do well together ... e.g. waqt.Bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When Gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with , a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else . This OVA is kinda the opposite . Though there 're only half a dozen episodes , it isn 't filled with action , but emotional things . The two main action sequences in this , I believe , are enough to satisfy me . After seeing so many gundam series , movies , and OVAs , I was completely ready for a civilian-esquire movie . This movie did a fantastic job of that . What makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people . It made the Zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they 're depicted as the second rise of evil Nazis . Most people that don 't like anime that I 've forced to watch this movie ( lol ) , liked it . So , I 'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti-war story . If you 're a Gundam fan , and haven 't seen this , you shouldn 't be reading this ; you should already be watching it right now . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it 's not all about being beautiful on the outside . The inside counts for something too . A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls . I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season . About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel . Recently , Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual . I felt that she should have done more to encourage her . It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look . Tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl out . Instead , the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism . It 's a shame because I truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons . There 's a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD and Top Model only has 1 season on DVD . It 's called taste .

" I once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on Turner Classic Movies about 6 months back . I thought every minute of what I was watching was gold , and , because it was somewhere in the film 's middle and I didn 't want to spoil the whole thing if I were to watch it from the start , I decided that I would rent it immediately . Well , the video store which I frequent did not have a copy , so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it . I had previous to that experience only seen some Chaplin shorts , funny but not greatly artful , but after I saw the snippet of The Great Dictator , I checked out three of his other films , City Lights , The Gold Rush , and Modern Times ( City Lights was great , I found the Gold Rush a little overrated , but still worthwhile , and I found Modern Times to be one of the funniest films I 've ever seen ( second funniest , behind Keaton 's Sherlock Jr . , more exactly ) .Finally , the whole of the Great Dictator . Well , to be honest , it had its moments , both of comedy and of drama . But these moments don 't always mix well . Chaplin 's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama ( City Lights is the best example of this ) , but it didn 't always work with social commentary . Plus , the fact that there was dialogue lessened the impressiveness of Chaplin 's talent . Don 't get me wrong , I liked the movie as a whole , but I thought it of little consequence . I would have given it a solid 7 / 10 on the ratings scale ... if not for the ending . The final speech that the Jewish barber gives is enormously powerful . Yes , it is adressed to the tempora et mores of 1940 , but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today . The speech brought me to tears , and I consider it one of the best endings I 've ever seen . Final score : 8 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie was for a while in my collection , but it wasn 't before a friend of mine reminded me about it 혯 until I decided that I should watch it . I did not know much about Close to Leo 혯 just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic 혯 Aids . Although the person who has aids 혯 is Leo 혯 the scenario wraps around the way in which Marcel ( the youngest brother of Leo ) coupes with the sickness of his relative . At first everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel 혯 he is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of his brother 혯 the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young Marcel . I know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves . With exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from Marcel , they have left quite an impression for me 혯 the way they supported their son 혯 even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his sickness . The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel along with Leo to Paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them혯 most families I know will be reluctant to do that . There is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together 혯 you can see them being real friends , concern about each other.Close to Leo is an excellent drama , which I strongly recommend , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's Bad for Ya really showcases more of George Carlin 's talents . He really is still as sharp as a tack . It is a shame that we lost him this past year , but his comedy will forever live on . This stand-up special is literally one of the funniest I have ever heard a comedian perform . Even though he is making fun of small children , it just makes you laugh the way he says some of the stuff . It is true that Carlin can literally make something that seems unfunny and turn it into one of the funniest things you have ever and will ever hear .

" I understand " " Checking Out " " will likely be released in Theatres in the USA in June 2006 , and on DVD in November 2006 . My recommendation is to not miss " " Checking Out " " ! ! This Comedy Film will entertain everyone , who will all relate to the characters , family relationships and multiple social issues that are portrayed . " " Checking Out " " will make you laugh throughout with quick fire clever humor built into almost every line , and may make you poignantly cry in a touching positive way as well . The subject of suicide is dealt with in a comical way , that at the same time may help people considering it understand the impacts this act may have on those their life has touched and on those who love them . Lets hope that " " Checking Out " " can have a positive impact and help prevent those considering suicide from acting it out , especially in the 16-25 age group that has the highest rate of suicide in the USA . The script is wonderfully written , perfectly casted , and loaded with synchronicity and meaningful flashbacks in time , whose significance become more apparent throughout the film and especially at the ending . I believe the script is worthy of an Academy Award Nomination for " " Best Screenplay , Play to a Movie " " ( The Phoenix Film Festival honored " " Checking Out " " with a " " Best Screenplay Award " " ) .The cast is loaded with great actors that out do themselves , and have a long track record of great performances , acting award nominations and wins . I feel Peter Falk 's performance in " " Checking Out " " is worthy of an Academy Award Nomination , and is the most challenging and wide ranging of his career . Laura San Giacomo 's performance and chemistry with Peter Falk as her father is masterful , and was recognized at the Palm Beach International Film Festival with a " " Best Actress Award . " " Even the teenage characters in the movie shine and are played by young acting phenoms Dan Byrd ( Movies : A Cinderalla Story with Hilary Duff ; 3 Young Artist Award nominations , Won 1 ) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead ( TV : Monster Island , Wolf Lake , Passions , Touched by an Angel ; 2 Young Star Nominations ) .Director Jeff Hare and Producer Mark Lane wonderfully develop the characters , their interrelationships , and the story line of this entertaining , enjoyable yet complex script.The film editing keeps the pace of the film moving quickly , only appropriately slowing in the poignant scenes , so that the audience will never loose interest from the beginning to the end.Don 't miss this film that you can take the whole family to see and all will enjoy it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Every movie critic and metal head hated this movie but I enjoyed it . I saw this as a child on TV somewhere and was amazed by the scene where Sammi comes on stage and plays Trick or Treat by Fastway.The movie itself was typical 80 's , guy gets pushed around by bullies and enlists supernatural help to beat up the bullies but goes to far and has to be destroyed.Matt from Melrose Place picks on Skippy from Family Ties so Skippy gets a record of Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose , the highlight being where Tony sings ( lip-synchs ) and dances to a metal song before the shyt hits the fan.There were a lot of errors and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" So , Fox pulled the plug midway through a drama / mystery ... How lame is that ? Do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens ? Why weren 't the remaining , already filmed episodes aired in the US ? They were broadcast elsewhere.Hey , Fox ! Are you listening ? This was a great show , but you left us hanging . If you 're going to introduce new drama / mysteries , at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid-theme . Every time something like this happens ( and it seems to happen a lot with you - i.e. , Fox ) , there are more of those who will " " wait and see " " before investing their time . This means you will see an artificially low interest share , and are more likely to end the series . See ? It is a vicious cycle . Don 't let us down again ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert . They find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past , present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner . Director John " " Bud " " Cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger , crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds . Moreover , Cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder . The admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus : Jim Davis as hearty patriarch Grant Williams , Dorothy Malone as his cheery wife Ana , Christopher Mitchum as the concerned Richard , Marcy Lafferty as his lovely wife Beth , Natasha Ryan as sweet little girl Jenny , and Scott C. Kolden as the gutsy Steve . The funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures , neat stop-motion animation monsters ( said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy , a big , lumpy , fanged beast , and a scrawny lizard dude ) , and nifty matte paintings . Richard Band 's rousing full-bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot . John Arthur Morrill 's crisp , sunny cinematography likewise does the trick .

" Firstly , I really enjoyed this movie and its message , which is about daring to live life to the fullest . Very poetic , with heartwarming and funny and sad scenes , very lively , it was a pleasure to watch . Here are my " " exceptions " " though : The movie was way too long and at some point , it kept adding more and more additional conflicts so that it started to lose the main story line . I disagree though with another comment that its unrealistic to have so many people with " " strange " " problems in such a small village . I think this was absolutely realistic ! There are incredible dramas going on everywhere , we just don 't know this about people we meet only superficially . I disliked the ending , which was so loaded with symbolism and extremely forced . It left a bad taste as it was just too much . I did not like it that so many big issues were dramatically mentioned in the group ( when some accused others in front of everyone else of major things , people would just be more " " ashamed " " to voice everything so personal in front of everybody , even if those people are a group one is closely working with ) . And : defending oneself is a human-beings strongest instinct . So why on earth would Daniel let himself be beaten and never fight back , not even to defend himself ? I mean he was not weak , he could at least try to defend himself when attacked but it just drove me mad to see him do nothing . It was as if the storyteller tried to forcefully bring across a message like " " violence is not needed " , " but the way he chose to do this was not good . I am also against violence but the character loses credibility when he stays unmoved despite all the attacks . And : Gabriella ... why on earth would a woman , who has spent years with a man beating her up , go to that man when he gets arrested and say " " I do not wish you any harm . You have just done your best , like all of us " . " Oh really , this spoiled so much ! Was she going to be a saint or what ? It would be normal for her to be bitter but not so almost " " holy " " and therefore not human . Was her work with Daniel and the music so great that it made her forget all of the s * * t that happened to her ? Oh , please . So , these were the spoiling moments . Nevertheless , I still think this is a delightful movie all in all , which is amazing enough , given my discomfort with quite a few things .

" This was a very faithful presentation of Lewis 's life in the mid-50 's . The dialogue on theology and the banter with his follow colleagues was exceptionally good . Michael White 's book , " " C.S. Lewis : Creator of Narnia " " deals with this time frame in a very parallel way . Joss Ackland 's acting was superb in catching the unemotional Lewis .

The development of a strong bond between " " Jack " " ( his preferred name ) Lewis and Douglas Gresham , Joy 's son from her previous marriage , was enjoyable to watch .

" Most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm . Not so this gloriously bent , batty and berserk over-the-top Italian-made shot-in-Canada kitsch gut-buster : It 's a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over-baked " " what the hell 's going on ? " " crackpot excess and inanity.A freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30-foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70 's disco stud ( complete with jumbo wavy afro ) perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice . They dethaw the beast , jolt him back to life with electric charges , grossly mistreat him , and keep the poor hairy Goliath in an enormous glass booth . Before you can say " " Hey , the filmmakers are obviously ripping off ' King Kong ' , " " our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage , grabs the first luscious nubile blonde Euro vixen ( the gorgeous Pheonix Grant ) he lays lustful eyes on , and storms away with his new lady love . The yeti gets recaptured and flown to Toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience . Of course , he breaks free again , nabs the vixen , and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage.The sublimely stupid dialogue ( sample line : " " Philosophy has no place in science , professor " " ) , cheesy ( far from ) special effects ( the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy Tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw-dropping awfulness ) , clunky ( mis ) direction , and a heavy-handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere " " Is the yeti a man or a beast ? " " ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen . Better still , we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew : the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti 's nipples , which causes it to harden and elicits a big , leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth ( ! ) ; the vixen nurses the yeti 's wounded hand while he makes goo-goo eyes at her , the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building , and the furry fellow even breaks a man 's neck with his toes ( ! ! ) . Overall , this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should-be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that 's eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

When Alan mentions things of his past , Charlie turns violent towards Alan or anyone who mentions his deceased family . Now Alan tries to help Charlie and tries to make his life a little easier for himself . But Alan finds out making Charlie talking about his true feelings is more difficult than expected.Written and Directed by Mike Bender ( Blankman , Indian Summer , The Upside of Anger ) made an wonderfully touching human drama that moments of sadness , truth and comedy as well . Sandler offers an impressive dramatic performance , which Sandler offers more in his dramatic role than he did on Paul Thomas Anderson 's Punch-Drunk Love . Cheadle is excellent as usual . Pinkett Smith is fine as Alan 's supportive wife , Liv Tyler is also good as the young psychiatrist and Saffron Burrows is quite good as the beautiful odd lonely woman , who has a wild crush on Alan . This film was sadly an box office disappointment , despite it had some great reviews . The cast are first-rate here , the writing & director is wonderful and Russ T.

The movie has great NYC locations , which the film makes New York a beautiful city to look at in the picture.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen ( 2.35 : 1 ) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound . DVD also an jam session with Sandler & Cheadle , an featurette , photo montage and previews . I was expecting more for the DVD features like an audio commentary track by the director and deleted scenes . " " Reign Over Me " " is certainly one of the best films that came out this year . I am sure , this movie looked great in the big screen . Which sadly , i haven 't had a chance to see it in a theater . But it is also the kind of movie that plays well on DVD . The film has an good soundtrack as well and it has plenty of familiar faces in supporting roles and bit-parts . Even the director has a bit-part as Byran Sugarman , who 's an actor himself . " " Reign Over Me " " is one of the most underrated pictures of this year . It is also the best Sandler film in my taste since " " The Wedding Singer " . " Don 't miss it . HD Widescreen .

" Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to do his own songs and it really works . It 's always good to see that fine actor , Don Stroud ( one of the crickets ) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10 . Best performance = Gary Busey . Thankfully , Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this , losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME . A fairly low-budget flick that doesn 't disappoint , with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly . I hope this made plenty of dough . Busey was never this popular again for varying reasons , but thankfully he has this one great one on his resume . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Those prophetic words were spoken by William Holden ( as a war reporter ) to the beauteous Jennifer Jones ( as a Eurasian doctor ) , explaining his failing marriage on the beach . They start an affair , despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues . In Hollywood of the 1950s , interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end . Beautiful Hong Kong scenery ( although some beach scenes look studio-bound ) , a famous title tune , poetic script , lovely background music ( by Alfred Newman ) , great costumes , outstanding performances , especially Jones ( directed here by Henry King , who also did " " The Song of Bernadette - 1943 , an Oscar for Jones ) still make this a world-class romance weeper . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot . The film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor 's innermost feeling . Max , who has lived in New York for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there , comes back to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend . Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well . The three women Max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations . His fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see . She gives him also no love but only stability . True love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex-girlfriend . Merely a fantasy for him to escape - many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable . The one who really animates Max 's life in fact is her best friend . The equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because Max has understand much more about his innermost feeling . The nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated . Not equally ingenious as " " Pulp Fiction " " but things seem much more natural in " " The Apartment " . " Max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to Romane Bohringer . The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful . A good commentary of today 's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " May Contain Spoilers * " " All Dogs Go to Heaven " " is a great movie . I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old . I didn 't understand it that well but as I saw it more and more times I started to love it . I love the songs in this movie . My favorite songs are " " Let Me Be Surprised " " and " " Soon You 'll Come Home " . " Those are beautiful songs . The only thing that bothers me about the movie is Charlie dieing . When I was little my sister couldn 't even watch that part . Other than that this movie is wonderful . My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie are flying around heaven . Heaven is beautiful in the movie and the " " clocks " " are very clever . I also love Itchy , in fact I have 3 dachshunds of my own . They are so cute . Overall I love this movie and suggest everyone should see it . I give this movie 10 / 10 stars . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ok , so it may not be the award-winning " " movie of the year " " type-film ( apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think won a few awards ) , but it is a really great film about ' The Kid ' ( Prince / O ( take your pick ) and the happenings around him living in Minneapolis , playing his music . The music is absolutely superb , in my opinion you HAVE to own this soundtrack , it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion . And the movie itself plays out a nice plot , it 's worth seeing over and over again , espeically if you like Prince / O ( which I do ) of course . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I don 't know about the English version of this movie , but the Norwegian translation is the funniest movie I 've seen in many years . The characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that I 'm amazed they kept having more options , like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard Miraculix correctly . It becomes things like Malcom ( i ) X and " " utenriks " , " which is Norwegian for foreign affairs.Like the word " " utenriks " , " many of the translations does not give any meaning in English , and probably not in French either , so the translators must have made up their own jokes , and done so very well . Of course , they have a very good base to build on , with a film that 's simply comical from beginning to end ! Recommended in all languages with a good translation ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This work is pretty atmospheric , with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements . I found this work more rewarding than I first expected , given the rotten reviews this receives here at IMDb . The dialog comes across as natural and honest ( given the circumstances ) , although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to clich챕 with the heroines falling down when they should be running , and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors . Typical horror movie fare.The local characters are some of the worst clich챕s , depicting Appalachian natives as in-bred developmentally challenged freaks . The characters of the children and the principals are GREAT ! The development given is adequate , and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to be developing her talents quite well.Now , I 'm not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since sliced bread ( which isn 't all that great by the way ) , but this IS interesting and I do not long for my 107 minutes back . I would not say this is an awesome movie by any means , but there are some really good horror elements herein . But there are also some really slow spots where plot / character development seem superfluous to the director 's ( or the film editor 's ) whim.All in all , this is good for a rainy night , but not so good for a Friday / Saturday night 's viewing.It rates a 7.6 / 10 from ... the Fiend : . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've watched this documentary twice - and although I 'm an major movie buff , most documentaries don 't hold my attention . This film however was mesmerizing . Almost every shot is perfect - saying so much more than an audio commentary ( which this documentary does not have ) .The concept of this film is amazing , I can 't praise it enough . Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought ? ? Amazing and excellent choices of interviews - film footage of a factory in China - the film makes you feel like you are actually there.I 'm political aware - and I 've read several books on globalization so there wasn 't anything in this film that was a surprise to me .

" A touching love story reminiscent of 혩In the Mood for Love ' . Drawing heavily on Chinese poetry and how this is used by eastern people to communicate feelings to each other , the story focuses on a schoolteacher who wants so much to be a model teacher as well as a good husband and father . A senior student is very attracted to him . As the story unfolds we see the emotions below the surface in his 20 year marriage and how he grapples with the moral dilemmas that face him .

" Penelope Spheeris ( of " " Wayne 's World " " fame ) made her mark with the documentary " " The Decline of Western Civilization " , " about the LA punk scene in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s . Most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts ( which often turn violent ) . Overall , we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies : whereas the hippies were into being natural , the punks wanted to have themselves as altered as possible , what with spiked hair and all . But also , we see how they 're really disaffected and sometimes becoming skinheads.Anyway , this is a really great time capsule . We 're not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel repulsed by it . But this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral . Truly worth seeing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " The Falcon and the Snowman " " is the story of two young men , a CIA employee and a drug dealer , who become disenchanted with United States foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union . The events of the film are based on a true story.Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations . The supporting cast also performs well , notably with a performance from David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame as a seasoned Soviet agent.The film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in . However , it does seem overlong and cumbersome at points in the middle . The ending , however , is tense , stunning and effective . There are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack , but also unfortunately a repeated mellow synthesizer track that doesn 't fit with a spy story . There are other spy films more worth seeking out than " " The Falcon and the Snowman " , " but it is a decent film none the less . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've been looking for the name of this film for years . I was 14 when I believe it was aired on TV in 1983 . All I can remember was it was about a teenaged girl , alone , having survived a plane crash AND surviving the Amazon . I remember people were looking for her ( family ) and that she knew how to take care of herself---she narrates the story and I vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin . I don 't remember much else about this movie , and want to see it again--if this IS the same one--and if any of you have a copy , could you email me at horsecoach4hire @ hotmail.com ?

" Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie ? I doubt it ! Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays . Thomerson has been funny in anything he does , from movies to series to stand-up comedy . If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it . I recorded this movie off of HBO back in ' 82 and have pretty much worn out the tape . One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course. with all the cocaine references in this movie , it 'd be panned as being way too politically incorrect today , as would Cheech and Chong .

" An amazing film , I 've only just seen it and I already want to see it again . I 'd never heard of Derek Jarman before I saw this film but now I am , I can 't wait to see his others . The film takes a whole new perspective of Shakespeare 's The Tempest , I 'm sure he 'd have appreciated it for Jarman 's use of the the play 's themes of love , magic , darkness and atmospheric tension . OK , OK there may have been a bit of nudity in the film which I hadn 't really anticipated but it didn 't offend me , it just surprised me and made the film more unpredictable . One Spoiler ( for those of a nervous disposition : Fast forward the flashback scene with Sycorax & Caliban and Ariel as their slave , its pretty graphic . Overall , if you are starting to find Kenneth Branagh 's Shakespeare performances flaccid and monotonous then you need to see this film .

" This movie is awesome . If you take it too seriously , of course you will hate it ; however , it 's quantity of " " dudes " " and " " right ons " " brings laughs and faint memories of about 15 years ago . I like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness , and its ability to make me want to watch its precursor , " " Bill and Ted 's Excellent Adventure " " ( 1989 ) . If you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes , and totally mature humor , don 't watch it ; however , if you want a film that is humorous and silly , yet intelligent and engaging , you will enjoy it .

" You would really need to remember the Monkees and have a clear understanding as to where and how they fitted into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this movie.There is no plot as such . Basically , it 's a crazy , mixed up pastiche of various , unrelated sequences . But , it IS interesting AND entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its wavelength . In short , it was a classic , cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late ' 60s experimental cinema . It contains some good songs , some ultra-groovy cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique.I give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons . First , it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly ensconced at the time . If a feature movie flops at the box office , the consequences can be dire for all concerned . Secondly , it was , for the most part , a creative success . And , finally , as already mentioned , it is , unquestionably , a classic of the genre and , as such , it is now historically important.Unfortunately , " " Head " " came too late in the Monkees career . But , there again , they would not have been allowed to make it earlier on because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image . Clearly , the members of the group knew , only too well , that the whole Monkees juggernaut had just about run its race when they started work on this project . In a way , it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out . They were tired of being treated like mere pawns in the high powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited over the preceding few years . In short , they " " wanted out " " and they were going to say a few things before they left.History , however , has vindicated the band . Let the critics be damned . The Monkees , left behind some of the best , most polished and successful pop records of the decade . Yes , they had plenty of help . But at the end of the day , THEY stood in front of the studio mikes , THEY fronted the movie and TV cameras and THEY did the concerts . They were fun and just a little bit crazy . But , unlike some of their contemporaries , they were never threatening . You could safely introduce a Monkey to your elderly aunt . " " Head " " probably borrows a bit too heavily from the Beatles " " Hard Day 's Night " " but it 's still worth another look for those who were around at the time or for younger retrophiles who have the ability to appreciate its significance.Enjoy ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Cunningly interesting Western from a director who had few peers in the genre . Much like other Anthony Mann pictures , The Far Country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery . Both of which play out amongst some of Mann 's peccadilloes like honour , integrity , betrayal and of course , death ! The story sees fortune hunting partners Jeff Webster { James Stewart } and Ben Tatum { Walter Brennan } travel to Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle . Aware of the blossoming gold-boom , they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a Klondike town . Arriving in Skagway they find self-appointed judge Mr. Gannon { John McIntire } ready to meet out justice to Webster on account of Webster having fractured the law , all be it with honest cause , along the way . In punishment Gannon takes the partners herd from them , but they steal them back and head across the Canadian border to Dawson-with Gannon and his men in hot pursuit . Here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved.Interesting from start to finish , The Far Country benefits greatly from James Stewart 's bubbling { anti } hero in waiting portrayal and Mann 's slick direction of the tight Borden Chase script . The cinematography from William H. Daniels is superlative , tho not done any favours by current DVD prints , and the film has a few surprises and a " " will he wont he ? " " core reeling the viewers in . Paying dividends on re-watches for hardened genre fans , it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful , yet dark , Western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart . 8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The " " movie aimed at adults " " is a rare thing these days , but Moonstruck does it well , and is still a better than average movie , which is aging very well . Although it 's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it , the movie has a wonderful specificity ( Italians in Brooklyn ) that isn 't used to shortchange the characters or the viewers . ( i.e. Mobsters never appear in acomplication . It never becomes grotesque like My Big Fat Greek Wedding ) The secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread . These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs . I miss these scenes . It also beautifully involves older characters . The movie takes it 's own slight , quiet path to a conclusion . There isn 't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax . Cage and Cher do very nice work.Moonstruck invokes old-school , ethnic , workaday New York much like ' Marty ' except Moonstruck is way less sanctimonious . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Interferencia starts as unemployed Martin Sanders ( Andres Bagg ) hears something strange on his phone , he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named Diana & arranging to meet her . Soon after Martin reads a local paper & sees the front page story about a prostitute being murdered & thinks back to what he heard . Martin confides in his friends Laura ( Virginia Lustig ) & Aaron ( Oliver Kolker ) but they don 't believe him . Then shortly after the same thing happens again , the phone call , the man , the prostitute & her death reported in the papers . Martin decides he has to find the killer & put a stop to his killing spree but who is it ? This Argentinian production that was apparently shot in just eight days ( why so long ? ) on a budget of about $ 3,000 ( why so much ? ) was written & directed by Sergio Esquenazi & I cannot believe some of the glowing comments Interferencia has on the IMDb . Out of 195 user ratings as I write this 113 of them rate this pile of crap 10 out of 10 , I am sorry but there is no way anyone should be giving a film this bad a quite literally perfect score of 10 out of 10 . If a score for a film on IMDb is fixed then this is it , I honestly don 't believe that if you showed Interferencia to 195 average people that well over 100 of them would rate it as being absolutely perfect , no way on Earth . The user comments are also amazingly positive , all by IMDb users who have only wrote comments for one film , this . The one user ( besides me ) who has actually written more than one comment gave it a rock bottom 1 out of 10 which sounds just about right . Everyone is entitled to an opinion but I would stake my life on the fact most of those positive comments are from fake accounts set up purely to big this piece of crap up . Where do I start ? How on Earth can I adequately describe how bad Interferencia is ? The plot is a mess that basically lives or dies by it 's terrible twists , while most twists turn a plot on it 's head & alters the perspective of everything that has gone before in a clever & relevant way & are genuine surprises here in Interferencia the twists destroy the first half of the film & makes it utterly pointless in a ' it didn 't actually happen ' sort of way & the twist is so poorly handled that it leaves you asking more questions than it answers . What made Martin go mad ? Why did he imagine the phone calls ? Why did he imagine a killer ? Why did he imagine the newspaper headlines ? No explanation is given for Martin 's behaviour during the first hour or so of the film , there 's just this absurd revelation that it was all in his mind & that 's it , that 's all the exposition there is . Then there 's a plot twist about Martin 's missing wife & her lover before Martin for reasons unexplained starts to kill his friends for no apparent reason . I am sorry but Interferencia is so bad , it 's so boring , it 's so badly written & thought out that I honestly can 't think of a positive thing to say about it . Sorry guy 's but that 's how I feel , quite simply Interferencia is one of the worst films I have ever seen & is a complete mess both conceptually & technically.According to the IMDb Interferencia was hot in just eight days , to be honest it doesn 't feel like that at all . Nope , it feels more like it was shot in five days ! The whole film is an eyesore , Interferencia has probably the worst nighttime shooting I have ever seen . It 's like no attempt was made to light the scenes , it 's like the makers just went into a dark room or basement or whatever & just shoot the scene regardless of whether you could see anything . The scenes set outside in the daytime have this horrible unnatural blue green tint to them for no apparent reason which just looks daft & becomes increasingly irritating . This strange tint is not repeated on indoor scenes so they are also quite jarring & noticeable . There 's no real horror or scares , in fact I would say Interferencia is more of a thriller than a horror . As far as gore goes there are two decapitated heads in a fridge , a knife is stuck in someones mouth & nothing else.According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $ 3,000 which makes Interferencia one of the lowest budgeted films ever commercially released surely ? Some people think just because a film is low budget all reasonable viewing standards should go out of the window & we should accept any old crap , wrong ! To watch this on DVD you will still have to pay good money & I personally think we have the right to expect some sort of good product . If this can get released & praised like it 's Oscar worthy then we can all release our holiday camcorder footage ( including embarrassing karaoke footage & scenes of total blackness as we forgot to take off the lens cap ) & win top prizes at the next Cannes film festival ! The acting is awful although the female lead Virginia Lustig is actually rather sexy & helps ease the pain of the final twenty odd minutes as she features a fair bit.Interferencia is an absolutely terrible film , seriously I beg you don 't be fooled by all the fake positive comments , there is no way anyone not involved in this or have some sort of agenda is going to give it a 9 or 10 out of 10 . An amateurish mess that is truly horrible to sit through . Sorry but that 's the way I see it , sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind ... you have been warned ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I 've been waiting 30 years to see this film . I played the soundtrack album as a teenager and through my 20s . Recently , I located a reasonably priced dvdr and I watched it this morning . It was in widescreen , probably even a 70mm print , stereo , the colors were quite good , very little fading , certainly not remastered but I 'm very very happy with this clean copy.Now for the film . It 's pretty good . I wouldn 't say it 's great though there are great scenes in it . Perhaps Premminger may not have been the right director for it , but I 'll say this . For me the center piece of the film was the hurricane scene . Marvelously staged by Premminger . One of the great weather scenes of all time.In fact , I 'd go as far to say that the acting scenes are better than the musical scenes , not that the musical sequences are bad . Not at all . They did lack ... something though . Perhaps it was the fact that there are no close ups and very few medium shots . It was almost like watching a filming of a stage production . Perhaps that was the feel that Premminger was going after . In the end it may not have been the right choice , but so it goes . It is far from a ruined movie.Having said that , not everyone loves the singers on the soundtrack either . I always have . They are perfect for this film . I love the singing voices . The actors lip-sinking are excellent for the most part . I just wish the songs were staged more imaginatively . Sportin ' Life 's two numbers are fine , but the intimate numbers don 't even feel intimate . They just feel ... far away . In spite of that , you cannot deny the power of the music . And in the end , that is what comes through loud and clear . Once again , maybe what Premminger was trying to do was to stay out of the way of the incredible music he was working with . I believe he had the right idea but perhaps went too far in that direction.The acting is terrific . Top kudos goes to the great Brock Peters who acts and sings the part of Crown . He is the ultimate meany . We just want him to leave poor Bess alone , and he doesn 't . As proud , arrogant and nasty as he is , Sammy Davis Jr 's classic rendition of Sportin ' Life is the slick devil himself and a very charismatic one at that . Arguably , Davis 's best film acting . Poor Bess just can 't handle two bad men . I 'm glad the Hermes Pan gave Davis a tap dance number to do.Dandridge and Poitier , reportedly not impressed by being in the film , really are very sweet together . I don 't know about chemistry ... there was more chemistry between Dandridge and Peters than there was between Dandridge and Poitier . Still , it worked out fine for Dorothy and Sidney.Even so , I think they should both be proud of the work they did on this film . They both managed to bring more than one tear to my eye . Their characterizations where very 3D and believable . Sidney Poitier 's Porgy , however , seems almost out of place in catfish row . I couldn 't help thinking he was Mr. Braithwaite in " " To Sir with Love " , " very educated and well mannered and spoken , fallen on hard times . He probably wouldn 't have been my first choice for the part of Porgy , but hey , he was a huge star at the time , so why not ? Dorothy 's Bess was as perfect as her Carmen Jones , in fact even more vulnerable this time around . Carmen was probably the flashier part for her to do.A very very good film indeed , it is two sticks short of what I would call a classic . It just doesn 't make the ultimate classic grade . Still , there is no reason on earth why the Gershwin estate has decided to keep this beautiful film , even with all of its flaws , hidden from the public as they have . Premminger may have made some odd choices as a director , but the film is nothing to be ashamed and embarrassed about for anyone involved with it . It is what it is and there are a lot worse movies than this that are embarrassing out on DVD and in theaters today . Porgy and Bess is not one of them . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Noni Hazlehurst 's tour-de-force performance ( which won her an AFI award ) is at least on par with her effort in FRAN three years later . Colin Friels is also good , and , for those who are interested , Alice Garner appears as Noni 's child , and Michael Caton ( best known for THE CASTLE ) is a bearded painter . ( Also interestingly , Hazlehurst is currently the host of lifestyle program BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS , and Caton is the host of property-type programs including HOT PROPERTY , HOT AUCTION , etc ... ) This film reaffirms the popularly-held belief that Noni was arguably Australia 's top female actor during the early-to-mid 1980s .

" I actually flipped to Lifetime channel by mistake , just as this movie was beginning , and ended-up watching it . It certainly deals with a serious issue , probably more prevalent than we realize , in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by an ego-maniacal fellow-student , who feels he 's above the system , and , unfortunately , often is.The cast here was believable , and the performances credible . A lot of these Canadian / Lifetime flicks are decidedly " " over-the-top . " " However , this is one I might label as " " under-the-top . " " While appreciating the fact that it wasn 't presented in an overblown fashion , this film somehow seemed like a record being played at a slower speed than proper , the 96 minutes seemed like many more , and it had the effect of looking like a shorter film , looped over-and-over , seemingly going on and on and on and ON - before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion.Yet the engaging characters and performances made it better than the average film of this type , despite these criticisms.And while these pictures often " " milk " " the climax , this one could have given it a bit more detail and length . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt 's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye . Zasu ( pronounced Zay-Sue ) does her best " " Olive Oyl " " impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman 's laynard . I kept waiting for her to say " " ohhh myyyy " , " but instead it 's " " something always happens to somebody . " " The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny . I 've since seen her in other films where she does this same whining , uptight , fragile-flower routine . So , upon watching this film again I started getting a little annoyed with the constant whining and near hysteria over a piece of dust . But , there are some funny comedy bits here , and it 's also a mystery movie as well . It 's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works . The mystery plot holds together well through the camp of Zasu Pitts and James Gleason who plays Arthur Crimmer the policeman . The haunted House is fun with many a secret passage and even a skeleton in the attic ! Well worth the watch .

" In all honesty , if someone told me the director of Lemony Snicket 's Series of Unfortunate Events , City of Angels , and Caspers was going to do a neat little low budget indie film and that 'd it be real good , I 'd say that person must be joking . But that 's what director Brad Siberling did . And it was really good . " " 10 Items or Less " " has a similar conceit to films like " " Before Sunrise , " " " " Lost in Translation , " " or more recently " " Once . " " It involves the chance meeting of two people who if serendipity didn 't put them there , they 'd probably never cross paths , or if they did , they wouldn 't say word one to each other . Like those films , " " 10 Items or Less " " focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters come to understand each other and build on each other 's strengths and weaknesses.The story involves Morgan Freeman , playing an unnamed actor who goes to research his role as a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control , ends up spending the day with the lady in the 10 items or less lane played by Paz Vega . She has a rotten marriage and is hoping to land a new job as a secretary . Initially , Freeman 's character just needs a lift home . After spending time with her , however , he wants to get to know her and maybe even offer her some advice.Brad Siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between Freeman and Vega . The plot is merely a setup for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the film 's 80 minute duration . Freeman has fun with his character , as he appears an outsider in lower class world that Vega 's character , Scarlett , inhabits . Vega , in the meantime , grows beyond the stubborn checkout clerk upset with her life 's situation looking to move on.There a couple things that really stood out in this film . First of all , Siberling has probably taken note from independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and doesn 't fall into any Hollywood pitfalls . It 's a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film . It works , even though the situation itself does seem a little inconceivable.I am also impressed with the performances . While Freeman 's presence gives this film credibility from the get-go , he shows a certain amount of charm and fun not usually seen from him . Paz Vega , meanwhile , is priming herself for a breakthrough in US film sometime in the future . I loved her in Spanglish and she 's equally good here as the tough , no-nonsense Scarlet . Towards the end of the film , she successfully conveys the growth of her character . I 'm looking forward to seeing her in more films.Overall , 10 Items of Less functions best as a character piece , well scripted and directed by Brad Siberling . He hasn 't done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big Hollywood films . Yet there 's certainly an artist at work here and am anxious to see if he 'll take this road again . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I read the other comments here about this movie before watching it . If you 've read them , you will know that they are almost all negative . I really don 't understand that . I admit that it is far too long ( it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit ) . The music is often inappropriate . But , strong performances by Ford and Thomas are indeed enough to carry this . With all his fame as a movie star , I 'd forgotten that Harrison Ford really can act ! This role as a man who has defined himself based upon a lie is remarkable . I find it completely believable that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was deception . Thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception . Her initial denial which leads to confusion and then to inner calm is tremendous . This movie is never going to be on anybody 's list of great flicks , but it isn 't that bad . I 'm glad that I waited to see it on video , but it is worth the $ 3 or $ 4 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Another well done moral ambiguity pieces where the anti-hero makes it hard to decide who to root for.If nothing else " " The Beguiled " " silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies-at least in 1971 . There were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed.Pamelyn Ferdin did a fine job as Amy and would go on to play " " Wanda June " . " This must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve-year-old girl on camera , wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time . It was probably Polanski 's favorite scene . Given the fate of Amy 's turtle " " Randolph " , " it is no surprise that Ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist.Geraldine Page was likewise excellent , playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint . It is interesting that she died just three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide ( throwing herself through a fifth floor window ) as they had also worked together in " " You 're a Big Boy Now " . " Hartman ( who looks like she could be Blair Brown 's sister ) was wonderful as Edwina and should have gotten an Oscar ( no other performance was even close that year ) , but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her . Edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch . Like Marilyn Monroe 's incredible performance in " " The Misfits " , " the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing.Finally there is Jo Ann Harris who is stunningly perfect as the flirty Carol . For my money Harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970 's , combining sensuality with intelligence and humor . She was the best reason to watch the " " Most Wanted " " television series and the only reason to watch " " Wild Wild West Revisited " . " Hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
... " dislike this movie and everyone would understand why . The plot is poor , so is the acting . But in my opinion it is better than Halloween 5 , although even this does not give many surprising moments . A few scenes are really well directed . But these few moments do not deliver the reason to rent it . I do not despise violence in movies , but H6 features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes which do not fit to the tradition of the Halloween-Movies . The most sucking aspect about H6 is the lack of tension . No comparison to the first masterpiece.Halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me . If you want , rent it . But don 't expect a great horror-experience .... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" William Shakespeare 's Merchant of Venice portrays 16th century Venice . Al Pacino plays Shylock , a Jewish loan shark who plots revenge on a Catholic that has looked down on him . The movie is a slow moving plot in the beginning that builds up throughout the two plus hours . The film gives a very good and believe appearance to it 's characters , especially Pacino . When hearing that Pacino plays a Jew one might think that it would not work looking at Pacino 's previous mobster type movie roles . Nonetheless it works very well , credit must be given to the costume designer 's and director 's of the film . The look of all the characters fits well with the time period the play takes place in . The costumes look like the Renaissance appearance one might envision to be.The film portrays a very anti-Semitic vibe . From the first minute to the last it is shown how the Catholic 's try to take advantage of the Jews in every way they can , even to the point of keeping them locked away in " " ghettos " " and not allowing them to regular jobs . In comparison to The Passion of the Christ , another recent film that people believed to be very Anti-Semitic , Merchant of Venice makes Passion look like a Jewish holiday . The film shows how the Jews , or at least Shylock wanted revenge for the mistreatment that the Jews received . The location shots also seem very timely and the scenery is at times very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film , making it just that much more realistic . Showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti-Semitic because the ugly is usually shown around the Jews and the beautiful around the Catholics.Although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura certain parts do add a bit of humor to the act . The oh so serious trial between Shylock and Antonio ( Irons ) adds a bit of humor when Portia ( Collins ) and Nerissa ( Goldenhersh ) come into the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated . That in itself might not be funny , but seeing it that they were women dressed up in disguise as men one might find it to be pretty amusing . The whole cross dressing scene , as compelling as it was could have probably been even more memorable had the make up artists and director Michael Radford taken notice that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized . The director also could have seen into the fact that the women are speaking through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men , which in part takes away from the scene but doesn 't kill it entirely.Overall the film gets a 7 out of 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song " " Honey Roll " " and poem " " I Meant To Do My Work Today " " by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible !

" Who says zombies can 't be converted into useful members of the community ? Certainly not the makers of " " Fido , " " who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950 's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class . Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family 's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido . All of this has been made possible by Zomcom , a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies ( who were originally brought to " " life " " by radiation from outer space ) manageable and docile - at least most of the time.This twisted , modern-day spin on the TV series " " Lassie " " - it might easily have been entitled " " A Boy and His Zombie " " - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre- ' 60s concerns as obsessive social conformity ( here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door ) , the sterility of suburban life , the corporate control of civic affairs , small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns . The movie doesn 't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs . Instead , this is a low-keyed , subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws . Much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community ( Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine ) . Despite some playfully graphic violence , the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950 's itself and the cheesy , low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade.K 'Sun Ray , Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and his Cleaver-esquire parents ( with slightly sinister undertones ) , while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.This is what " " Lassie " " might have been had Timmy 's best friend been afflicted rabies . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have seen a lot of Saura films and always found amazing the way he assembles music , dance , drama and great cinema in his movies . Ib챕ria shows an even better Saura , dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music . Another thing that called my attention is the fact that , in this movie , dancers and musicians , dance and music , are equally important : the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation , examining not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing . The interest of Saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works . That 's why I recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema , good music , good dance , great art . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Film follows a bunch of students in the NYC High School of the Performing Arts . There 's Coco ( Irene Cara ) a black singer who WILL make it to the top despite everything . She 's helped by Bruno ( Lee Curren ) a white musician . Then there 's Doris ( Maureen Teefy ) who wants to be an actress--but she 's shy and scared . She becomes friends with Motgomery ( Paul McCrane ) --purportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by Raul ( Barry Miller ) . Then there 's Leroy ( Gene Anthony Ray--who sadly died in 2003 ) who 's homeless and a great dancer--but can 't read . Then there 's various teachers ( Albert Hague , Anne Meara stand out ) trying to teach the kids.The songs are GREAT ( the title tune and " " Out Here On My Own " " were nominated for Best Song-- " " Fame " " won ) , the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent . BUT this film misses the boat in the drama department . Many plot lines are brought up and completely left open-ended by the end of the movie . Why did Coco do a porno ? Did Doris and Raul remain together afterwords ? Did either make it ? How about Montgomery--what happened to him ? And did Leroy ever graduate--and how ? There are too many long speeches ( Raul has two ) and moments that just lead to nothing . I 'm assuming there were cuts in the script--I can 't believe the movie just left all this open . Still , it 's worth seeing for the acting and , again , the music . There 's basically not one bad song and the dances go full force ( and at one point stop traffic--literally ! ) . My favorites are " " Fame " , " " " Out Here ... " " and " " I Sing the Body Electric " " which is a great closing song . So I recommend it but can only give it a 7--the script really needed to tie up loose ends--and it didn 't.Trivia : They wanted to shot this film at the actual School for Performing Arts but couldn 't get permission . The dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film . That is true--there is a LOT of foul language but that 's how high school kids talk .

" Susan Sarandon . She made this movie for me . I 've never appreciated her acting more than as I did in this movie . She really acted as though she were Adele August . I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who 's truly believable . Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie . The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral.I gave this movie an eight rating , but Susan received a ten from me because of her performance .

When Thornway goes back to New York to stage his show , Lily follows ( unknown to John of course ) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show , only as a favor to her family , however Thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms , which makes the show 's leading lady , Isabel Rekay , jealous . When Isabel gets fed up with the John-Lily romance causing friction with the show , she leaves , and John decides to make Lily the star . Isabel returns later , and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play , which also may jeopardize the romance . Very charming film , and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comedic touches into her role ( her reading of Lady MacBeth , while supposed to be humorous , never threatened her singing career ) I enjoyed Heflin 's character ( Thornway ) more when he was annoyed with Lily rather than be the romantic .

" Let me just say - I love the horror genre to the extent that I see every single one that I can get my hands on regardless ( except really low quality b-movie horrors which I could do without ) and recently have become a big fan of Eastern horrors . Little did I know that a Korean horror would be the one that tops my list beating off heavyweights such as the Japanese Ringu ( or the American Ring ) , or even quality US movies such as the Sixth Sense and The Others , and the widely acclaimed Hong Kong horror ' The Eye ' .Previously ' The Ring ' had stood as my favourite horror but it seems to me that I prefer the beauty of ' The Tale of Two Sisters ' any day - the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation thus allowing repeat viewings although chances are you 'll want to watch this again and again just because the movie is so masterfully shot ... the story is likely one of the best in the genre to date . The acting is top notch too from the entire cast and the scares when they come have the potential to rattle you like anything within the Ring - I did find myself glued to the screen at those points unable to take my eyes off . Still I am glad it didn 't come back to haunt me later that Sadako / Samara did from the Ring - after all such feelings are unpleasant and The Tale of Two Sisters leaves you with an uneasy feeling , but one that hopefully won 't leave you without sleep but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special . But do remember .. if you don 't understand the plot after the first viewing , a repeat viewing is more than advised .. I personally didn 't have time for this since it was late so I flicked through scenes on the DVD , some numerous times until I had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net , seemed Ihad pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation . And the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful.All in all - a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same ' level ' remake ( its been purchased by Dreamworks ) simply because of the Korean content and everyone is advised to catch this in the theaters or on DVDs while they can ... its one of the best you will get . Unfortunately due to the type of movie this is , there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what I did - watch it without knowing a single thing except its ' a tale of two sisters ' !

" Nemesis ' was the last book to feature Miss Marple written by Agatha Christie ( the official final case ' Sleeping Murder ' was written in the forties ) and I 've always had a very soft spot for it . I loved the characters and they are lovingly brought to life in this excellent BBC adaptation with Joan Hickson , terrific as ever , as Miss Marple.On the whole it is very faithful to the book . A few characters are dropped , the first ( new ) murder is slightly different and a couple of new characters are introduced . Personally I felt that the added character of Lionel Peel was unnecessary and rather irritating . Tour guide Madge was irritating in a different way but often quite amusing . It 's largely because of Lionel that I don 't award 10 out of 10 ! The other characters are beautifully done especially Helen Cherry as a dignified Miss Temple and all of the three weird sisters but particularly Margaret Tyzack who gives a towering performance as Clothilde . She threatens to go over the top towards the end but just avoids it . The female bodyguards are good value too and the episode contains one of my favourite Hickson lines ... ' An Archdeacon ? ! ' This is another relatively early BBC Marple that looks wonderful and is has a gloriously nostalgic feel to it . Highly recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" An excellent interpretation of Jim Thompson 's novel , this neo-noir thriller has all the requisite elements--deranged ex-boxer turned drifter , alcoholic widow with sinister desires , ex-cop turned small-time crook , and a kidnap plot destined for doom . Yet , the film never crosses into cliche country , but remains fresh and intriguing . The performances are all superb , particularly Bruce Dern 's role as the wicked sleazeball , Uncle Bud . There is a tense uncertainty to the film 's movement which , intentional or not , adds to the grim proceedings . Highly recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Cybrog 2 : Glass Shadow stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks ( Rhymes with kicks ! ) a karate instructor who helps a Cash ( Jolie ) escape from Pinwheel , her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company . Along the way Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd show up to displace the duo , while Jack Palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run . One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise , is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast . The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon ( Don 't know her ? Well she was in a bunch of 70 's pornos ) this one has Jack Palance , Elias Koteas , Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie . The third one has William Katt , Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell . ( Okay so , Cyborg 3 's cast isn 't that impressive . ) I 've never seen Cyborg 3 , but I did see this on Sci-Fi channel and must admit I wasn 't impressed . Actually strike that , Cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie , it 's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye . However Cyborg 1 was the same way , indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style , slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye . Unfortunately like the first , this one doesn 't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture . Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom , so for various reasons the movie doesn 't have much to offer beyond it 's look . Another aspect is the terrible acting . Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie isn 't much better . Elias Koteas and Jack Palance come off fine but seriously Palance is playing a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor . I guess on the positive side you can 't accuse Michael Schroeder of not being ambitious with casting . Still the movie is dull and I for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in .

One always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative , but who knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary . If you can put aside Rohmer 's unabashed defense of the monarchy ( and that is not an easy thing to do , given that , for instance , the French lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts ) , this is actually an elegant , intelligent and polished movie . Lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century France , Rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards . It is a blatantly artificial conceit , but it somehow works . And newcomer Lucy Russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn 't be . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Life was going great for New York City advertising artist Ted Kramer . He had a great job and a loving wife . No , actually , his wife wasn 't so loving , for when Ted returned home late from work that night his wife , Joanna , had a suit case packed and was heading out the door . He tried to stop her , but she just got into the elevator and out of Ted 's life . Well , now in addition to his job he 's now got to mind the house as well as their 6-year-old son , Billy ; Ted assured his boss that his wife 's leaving would not affect his job performance in any way . It did however affect his performance as a father . He blew up when Billy spilled punch on his client artwork ! Well , some time later Ted and Billy receive a letter from Joanna , and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn 't coming back . Ted was distraught . Well , he was late coming home from work on Billy 's birthday , which made Billy sore at him . Ted was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting . When he got home , he yelled at Billy for sneaking ice cream during dinner . Then later he truthfully told Billy that the break-up between he and Joanna may have been his fault , not Billy 's ; Ted invited a good friend , Phyllis Bernard over that night , and well , Billy got his first look at a naked woman . When Ted took Billy to the park the following day , he fell off the jungle gym and landed face-first onto his toy plane . Ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches . After that , life began taking a downward spiral for Ted . Then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than Joanna ! They met in a corner caf챕 . At first they have a pleasant conversation but then Joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her . Ted would have none of it and stormed out . Well life got even worse for Ted when his boss , Jim O 'Connor , took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him . Not only that but Joanna was choosing to sue for custody of Billy , and without a job , Ted didn 't stand a chance in hell for winning . He hired himself a lawyer , John Shaunessy , who charged a pretty penny : $ 15,000 exact change . And that 's IF they win . Ted was also able to find a new job . It was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination . Finally the court date , January 9 , 1980 , arrived . Judge Atkins presiding . Joanna took the stand and Shaunessy proceeded to question her about why she left Ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures . The next day , Ted took the stand and Joanna 's lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger . Ted 's good friend Margaret took the stand as well and she really didn 't help matters . Well , the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough , one day Shaunessy informs Ted that he lost . Joanna got sole custody of Billy . How typical ! Always ruling in favor of the mother . Well , Ted and Billy were just devastated about parting ways . They had a tearful goodbye when suddenly Joanna stopped by . She and Ted have a little talk and well , rather than just give away the ending , let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody ! This was a very good movie . Dustin Hoffman was very good . He earned that Academy Award . I 've also seen him in Hook , Meet the Fockers and Rain Man , which he also won an Oscar for . Meryl Streep was good . She also got an Oscar . Justin Henry was good too , so where was his nomination ? I guess the Academy had a rule against giving Oscars to children , but the rule was lifted when Haley Joel Osment came along . This movie has great drama , light comedy , and is very subtle . It does a good job of holding your attention . I was watching Rain Man on TCM the other night then this came on after and I just couldn 't help but watch . And that 's what you should do . If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies of this genre , then I recommend Kramer vs. Kramer ! A gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child . I liked Ted 's little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time . What was it about sex that makes a good parents ? Actually , that 's how they have the child . But seriously , he 's right . Why always rule in favor of the mother because she 's a woman ? Also in the cast , George Coe , Howard Duff , who passed away in 1990 , and Howland Chamberlain who passed away in 1984 . Watch for an up-and-coming JoBeth Williams in the nudity in the hallway scene . Anyway , see Kramer vs. Kramer today ! ! ! Good movie ! ! - , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I liked it ... just that ... i liked it , not like the animated series ... i love it ! ! ! . The fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate , but this cartoon was awesome , but it really didn 't like it that much . There 's too much people talking about Bruce being so cold , but if this is around 5 years later , anybody in a crime-fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude , so to me it isn 't a flaw . Batgirl was awesome she really fit there , as there isn 't more Dick Grayson as a robin , batman needed a good teammate , not like the new robin , he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child . But heres what didn 't work : The new artwork ... it isn 't horrible but ... to me it does 'nt work in a series like batman . This is a dark character , with a maniac killer like the joker , so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon , The joker isn 't a bad design but i still like the past joker ( but to me the BEST joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond : return of the joker ) , so this joker isn 't near as good . The good thing about the joker is that it still mark Hamil voice . My favorite character : Harley Quinn ( im in love for her ) They put an awesome episode for her : Mad love ( to me the best episode of this series ) . Here we finally know how she turned Harley Quinn , and how the joker twisted her mind , and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series , darker , no happy ending , brutal fight with the joker ( but too short ) , this is how it was to be ALL the series . BUT in general i didn 't like how she made Harley in this series ... in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way , she get punched , she say nonsenses , she make flaws ... c 'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her , not from her ... and here they put ridiculous ( like i said the only episode where i don 't think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper ) So in general its a good series , it has it upsides and downs , the drawn could be better ( MY GOOD ! ! ! KILL THAT CATWOMAN ! ! ! ! ) nice sound effects , nice music , nice voices and nice episodes : my favorites , Mad love , Jokers millions , Old Wounds , Sins of the father , and Cold comfort . If you enjoyed Batman : TAS you can watch this but don 't spec too much , in the other hand if you didn 't watched TAS , watch this first and then watch TAS in that way you 're really gonna love TAS : D , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Harman and Isings ' Old Mill Pond ' is a true masterpiece of the art of animation . The consummate skill and artistry that characterise this duos work is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon . It is a shame that so many people can see only offence in what is , and was always intended to be , a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate black people . If anything it is a tribute to the infectious humour and musicality of the black race . I have not been able to view this confection for many years as the ' race commissars ' in England have deemed it too offensive to be shown in multi racial Britain . If anyone knows where I can obtain a copy I would dearly love to view this masterpiece again . I think those who routinely look for messages and intent that were never intended in these cartoons , which are , after all , sixty years old , should try to lighten up and remember that the world is a very different place today , but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censor what is viewable from the past . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Opera ' ( 1987 ) Director : Dario Argento ( Deep Red , Suspiria ) Screenplay : Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini ( The Church , Sleepless , Demons ) Photography : Ronnie Taylor ( A Chorus Line , Sleepless ) Music : Claudio Simonetti ( Phenomena , ' Goblin ' ) Story : Betty ( Cristina Marsillach ) is the Lady Macbeth understudy of a very stylized staging of Verdi 's Macbeth opera . Betty 's time to shine comes when the diva star breaks her leg before opening night when she is hit by a car running away in a tantrum . The famous curse of Macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating turn when right away the body count begins to rise . It seems Betty gets her first fan via a stalker who ties her up and tapes needles to her eyes to force her to witness the grisly murders of the people around her . Story : 3 of 5Acting : Acting in a lot of these Italian films can sometimes be hard to judge . English , Italian , French , German , Spanish can sometimes all be in the same flick as they usually speak their native languages making dubbing rule of thumb and hard to judge . I usually cut them some slack in the area as a result . Acting : 4 of 5 Direction : Giallo maestro Argento enters again the genre helped pioneer . ' Opera ' shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite blend of gore , tension and beauty . Direction : 4 of 5Visual : This has to be one of Argento 's best looking films . Gorgeously filmed by Taylor , ' Opera ' features some stunning and inventive camera-work that keeps the film running fast and hard and keeps the eye-candy coming . The camera always seems to be in notion whether it is a wonderful shot of the camera going up a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of a bird 's eye view of said bird circling the crowd at the opera house . Visual : 5 of 5Audio : Frequent Argento collaborator Simonetti ( through his various bands Goblin , Demonian and solo effort ) compliments the screen action with zeal as his score touches from the classical ( Verdi ) to metal musings ( with a little help from Brian and Roger Eno and Bill Wyman ) and lends music muscle to the screen 's bloody gristle . The sound design give you all that you need from stabbings to gunshots , fire to screams and masterfully remastered on the Anchor Bay disc in glorious 6.1 for every crunch and caw . Audio : 5 of 5Technical : The editing keeps the film flowing and moving wonderfully . Combined with the camera-work , the editing help keeps the surreal dreamy imagery flowing . The exquisite opera house is one hell of a location and perfect for staging the horror version of Macbeth . One can 't end a review of an Argento film without having to comment on the kills . Argento dispatches characters with glee this time around with a brilliant stabbing sequence , crow eye-gouging and the film highlight of a gun blast through a keyhole into the eye and out the back of the head shot that once again sends Argento 's ex-wife Daria Nicolodi to the movie morgue . Priceless ! Technical : 5 of 5Wrap-up : A nearly flawless giallo that suffers from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in Switzerland that delivers all the visual thrills that Argento fans crave.Overall : 4 of 5 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Just as Ted Kramer ( Dustin Hoffman ) is about to get a break in his professional life his frustrated wife Joanna ( Meryl Streep ) finally gets up the courage to leave him , leaving Ted to care for their five year old son ( Justin Henry ) . Being a single parent proves to be quite the chore for Ted , and he suffers professionally but also learns there 's much more to life than a career as he continues to bond with , and really get to know , his own son . But then Joanna returns and intends to get her son back , which leads to a cruel custody trial.Kramer vs. Kramer is a superbly well written and magnificently acted human drama that will only leave the most cold-hearted a viewer untouched . Hoffman 's growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out . It always feels very real and thanks to the film 's low-key approach it makes even more of an impact and can easily work upon multiple viewings , the film 's dramatic impact does not lessen.Easily recommended ; 10 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The final part of Kieslowski 's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image . In Red , imagery is paramount , as well as the obvious but clever color coding . However , rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the ' cinema du look ' , Kieslowski 's Red is a multi-layered , densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love . In Red , love and fate are intertwined but complex notions , dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by . You sense Red is really an allegory , a reenactment of Prospero 's omnipresent gestures in The Tempest , yet it is more than its story appears . Red demands countless viewings , and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structure.Although Red stands alone as a masterwork from Kieslowski , it 's best viewed as part of the trilogy . Elements of Blue and White are referenced in Red , which knowing viewers will enjoy . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Spoilers . This review has been edited due to word limit . ' The horror . The horror . ' Marlon Brando , Apocalypse Now ( 1979 ) and Apocalypse Now Redux ( 2001 ) The sentence which is as famous as ' Here 's looking at you , kid , ' or ' Are you talkin ' to me ? ' or ' May the Force be with you , ' or ' I 'll be back , ' means a little more than some one-liners . When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed . What might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re-watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame.What , exactly , does this line of dialogue mean ? The horror spoken of is the reality of war . The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt . When Capt. Willard ( Martin Sheen ) stands before the dying Col. Kurtz ( Marlon Brando ) at the end of the film , ' The horror.the horror . ' is the realization of Willard 's corruptness . He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment . This isn 't a typical Hollywood ending . In most cases a character gains something , whether it be emotionally , physically , mentally or all three . But Willard both gains and loses . He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals . And that is a shocking ending . ' Apocalypse Now ' is Francis Ford Coppola 's tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking . This film is wholly different from ' The Godfather . ' It is hallucinogenic , visually dazzling , and an ode to the guilty side of human nature . At first it seems realistic , and then it becomes strange , and then symbolic , and , by the end , original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare . This is not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it is a film about the war within us.At first it does appear to be another war film . Captain Willard ( Sheen ) is assigned by an Army Lieutenant ( a young Harrison Ford ) to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz ( Brando ) , who is hiding out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves.Willard carries out his mission ' with extreme prejudice , ' heading out on a boat along with four soldiers , including the boat captain , Chief ( Albert Hall ) , Chef ( Frederic Forest ) , and a very young ' Larry ' Fishburne ( who later went on to appear as Morpheus in ' The Matrix ' ) . " " Apocalypse Now " " is in a many ways a modern update of Homer 's Odyssey . As our main character , Willard , carries on his journey , he meets an array of original and strange characters , including Lt. Col. Kilgore ( Robert Duvall ) , who has a strange fetish for surfing , and a stoned photographer ( Dennis Hopper ) , whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser Jeremy Davies in " " The Million Dollar Hotel , " " one of the worst films I have ever seen . Davies failed to make any connection with an audience ; Hopper does . He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz ; he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages . In this case , he is translating Kurtz to Willard , although I 'm not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willard.Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines . " " Apocalypse Now " " has many . Kilgore descending upon a Vietnam village playing Wagner 's " " Ride of the Valkyries " " remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history . There is sharpness to it , a brutality to it , an ironic tone to it , and also a sense of playfulness . When Kilgore kneels down on that beach and says , ' I love the smell of napalm in the morning.it smells like victory , ' we all crack a smile.I won 't lie to you : ' Apocalypse Now ' is a strange film . It isn 't exactly the easiest thing to analyze . The end may frustrate some viewers if they don 't understand Marlon Brando 's significant speeches . But what it all comes down to , what really matters , is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche . The horror is the realization of war and its effects , not the war itself . Kurtz says , ' You have a right to kill me . But you have no right to judge me . ' Brando 's character , Kurtz , is left to the audience to judge . To many na챦ve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head . But that isn 't what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to get across . By fighting in Vietnam , Kurtz has realized just how great he had it , and how bad some others had it . By walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the na챦ve ones , living our lives in a fool 's paradise . We are totally na챦ve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit . By seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are , Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something . Just how easily he could end up like the people around him . And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door . Many people think the horror is one thing . It is two . For Kurtz , the horror is the reality of how na챦ve he was and the reality of the war 's impact upon men . And after Willard murders Kurtz , and hears Kurtz 's dying words , he realizes it too . He realizes the effects of war . To see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man . And what it has done to him . The horror.5 / 5 stars - , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Okay I marked this spoiler so don 't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie . And I was right , as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most . What helped was the story , I did not expect there to be a " " WHY " " to Kane 's madness . But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness . Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for . But if your a fan of Saw , or some other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content this is a movie to watch . Now where I really throw in a spoiler for a second warning . I give this movie a 9 perhaps because I 'm a fan of the WWE and a fan of Kane , but who doesn 't like a movie a little bit better when it stars somebody we love . However this movie could have scored a 10 for me IF . . . ( spoiler ) ---- > at the end of the movie when it showed Kane dead on the pavement . While a dog pissing in his eye was " " CUTE " " it could have been classic with the Kane / Undertaker quick sit up and turn of the head . A perfect 10 would have been awarded if that would have happened . It was a perfect opportunity , but either the WWE didn 't think of that or a future sequel will begin with that very sequence I mentioned . That 's all . ( 9 ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I take notice to remember to avoid all his next movies.It 's a pity because all good things were at hand : Malaysia is a beautiful jungle , it was the British Empire and the cast is wonderful : Jessica knows how to open her soul and for one time , she has found an appropriate movie for this . Bob Hoskins shows a great experience and he should have won an award for this role.The only positive thing is that it makes me open a world-map to locate this island because if you guess it happens in south Asia , you don 't know where exactly !

" As I have said before in previous comments , some programmes are there to be ' Light entertainment ' . So I get somewhat frustrated when commentators seem to be expecting a program that will reveal the meaning of life , you will not get that from Cleopatra 2525 and it does not presume to offer it . What you get is a girl who was frozen and is brought back to life some 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic . She does not settle in within 10 minutes as what happens with other time travelling adventures and neither is she the female equivalent of James Bond ready to take on all comers.Cleopatra is overawed by her new surroundings and frightened by some of the weaponry on display as most of us would be . However it is light entertainment , the stories have a beginning a middle and an end in quick time and their are some surprisingly good moments of acting . The episode when there is a double of Cleopatra is particularly moving and Jennifer Sky I think gives one of the best performances of someone dying for a long long time , and being a film and television buff I know what I am talking about . Finally to prove my sincerity I have purchased all but four of the episodes and I am entirely satisfied with my purchase . The only reason I do not have the complete set is because I purchased the other episodes before realising that there was one complete box set . Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio creditably and for light entertainment Cleopatra 2525 certainly entertained me . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Okay , so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way , but from the beginning , Hidden Frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances , and have always been willing to mistakes they 've made . They advice people to see newer episodes first , so they can see just how good the show is , and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes . The cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on-screen . The influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show , as the story lines go from strength to strength . The show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression , drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way , but that is what Star Trek is and was all about . It portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way , dealing with them subtly and smoothly . Yes , they have used some characters from Trek history , but they have done them justice - characters like Shelby , Lefler and Necheyev , vastly underused in the show , had a rebirth in the New Frontier books , but they lost their sizzle after a while , when Peter David when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci-fi , and HF shows those characters in a completely different light , which serves them better . The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved . They release bloopers for every episode , so the fans can see what a laugh they have , because they are people doing it in their spare time , with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide-eyed in shock ! What this series , now drawing to a close after 7 years , has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together , inspiring others to do the same . HF will live for a long time after it ends , as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is an exceptional film . It is part comedy , part drama , part suspense . The dialog is exquisite . Most of the actors and actresses were very famous in their time , and for good reason . You will probably recognize someone , even if you don 't usually watch older movies . They are also each in a role that particularly suits their talents . One correction to make on another users comment is that two people , not one , are announced to die in the accident . Maybe the unlucky two are a reflection of what the writer considers important in life . The movie is too engaging to worry about who it is until it happens.The story is ahead of its time , but it does not lose the quality of an older movie .

" Now I like Victor Herbert . And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones . But it would have been nice to see a real biography of Victor Herbert . Walter Connolly as Herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter yearsJones and Martin sing beautifully though . The Herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers . Jones 's John Ramsay is a frail character , very similar to Gaylord Ravenal in Showboat who Jones also played.As for Mary Martin , it 's a mystery why she never had a good Hollywood career . She did films with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell as well as this one . She performed well , but movie audiences didn 't take to her . The best musical moment in the film is Jones and Martin in a duet of Thine Alone . The recordings I have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet . There 's also a pleasant scene with Jones and Martin riding bicycles swapping Herbert songs as they ride.The real Victor Herbert with his womanizing and his Irish patriot background and his musical training in Germany where he developed a love for all things German would have been a fascinating study . He was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing . I have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said Cuddles Sakall would have been a good Victor Herbert . Sakall as Irish , HELLO.Nice movie , but the real Vic would have been so much better . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Crossfire ( 1947 ) Great Message , Great Symbolism , Very Good MovieIt 's hard to go totally wrong with Robert Mitchum , Robert Young , and Robert Ryan all together as the three male leads , and with director Edward Dmytryk pulling together a complicated murder and detective yarn . That 's reason enough to watch it once and even twice.You might need a second look to fully catch the plot as it is explained ( too much ) or shown in flashback ( also too much ) because it 's a little complicated without good reason . But it makes sense overall , and we see early on ( too early probably ) who the culprit is , and even why.Besides the drama , well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short quips that make post-war films dramatic , there is the social message , the anti-anti-Semitic point of it all . It only borders on preachy once or twice , and it 's such an obviously good point to make we watch it being made approvingly and wait for the plot and the dramatic acting to take front row . Which they do , especially Young , who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective , and Ryan , who is mean in a believably crude and angry way ( Ryan is good at that , his typecasting reasonable ) . Mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for , and the fourth known acting force , Gloria Grahame , is a great , brief , presence even if slightly dispensable.Though the movie is dominated by the sequence of events and by the message , both of which grow in force as we go , it is really easy to watch just for the lighting , camera-work , and acting , including the classic fight scene that opens the first few seconds of the film , all done with shadows . The archetypes of soldiers presented is very deliberate , and this might be something people at the time were very familiar with and could relate to as much as the anti-Semitism thread . The shell-shocked soldier rendered helpless ( but still intrinsically capable ) , the modest youngster without confidence ( but capable , too ) , and the weary but outwardly able veteran are all there . And of course , the angry , violent soldier who is a product of the war , too . This last is also a responsibility of society--even the army goes all out to make good on the injustices here , not just because they are criminal , but because they stem from the wear and tear of a long awful war.The audience then , more than now , could really get , but it 's there to appreciate still . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women . His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase . He also did a Loretta Young suspense thriller Cause For Alarm a couple of years earlier . The play Dinelli wrote was originally entitled The Man and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season . It was Dinelli 's only effort on Broadway and it starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone . The roles that Gish and Boone played are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan . For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference . Dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen so I 'm wondering what he thought about that . Certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story.That wasn 't the only thing that was eliminated . The people are all wearing period clothing from around World War I yet there 's no reference at all to the time this story takes place in . I thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to Ida Lupino 's residence , I noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era.The film is almost entirely set within Ida Lupino 's home where she 's hired an itinerant stranger in Robert Ryan as a handyman . The film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference . It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupino in her home for about a day.Both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made . Films like Beware My Lovely are the stuff that a small studio like RKO did best . If this were done at MGM or Paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Functioning as a sort of midpoint between " " Waiting for Guffman " " and " " A Mighty Wind " , " " " Best in Show " " portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate . Some are weird , some crazy , and otherwise , but they all make the movie good . Director Christopher Guest is particularly funny as gay Harlan Pepper , very much trying to promote his dog . Eugene Levy , Parker Posey , Michael McKean , Catherine O 'Hara , and Bob Balaban also do great jobs ( I can 't imagine them not doing great jobs , at least not in a Christopher Guest movie ) . As someone who 's never attended a dog show , this movie is my main exposure to them . They sure look neat . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a quirky movie that the Brits do so well . Low budget , cameo type roles , well executed . The story is a little weak , a recently widowed Judi Dench decides to round up the " " blonde bombshells ' a all ( well almost all ) girl band who performed during the war in London . The obligatory son / daughter who thinks she 's gone potty . I did like the way the movie lets young people see that they don 't have a monopoly on feelings , love and even lust ! That the " " old wrinklies " " can have a good laugh too . Judi Dench was superb as always , a pity we didn 't get to see more of the other " " blonde bombeshells , the end was a little rushed I thought . I kept thinking as I watched that David Jason would have made an even better Patrick than Ian Holm , although he was quite adequate as the " " transvestite " " drummer . All in all a cheery movie well worth a night in with the girls : ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I 've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra 's music , and just recently I wrote a term paper about his life story . I 've been fascinated by the life and legend of Ol ' Blue Eyes . However , I 've never seen any of his movies . So I wanted to see if his acting was as great as his singing . Well ... it was ! I was blown away by his performance in this movie ! He really does a tremendous job as recovering heroin addict Frankie Machine , who 's trying to put his life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band . Otto Preminger 's direction is great as well . I haven 't seen any of his other movies . I read his biography on the IMDB . He seems like one of those directors who was sorely misunderstood , and people had conflicted thoughts about him . Seems like the kind of person who appeals most to cult enthusiasts . I haven 't seen enough of his films to know for sure if he 's really brilliant , but now I 'm curious . I want to see more of his films , because judging by his attempt with " " The Man with the Golden Arm " " this guy has talent . I also loved the music for this movie . The score definitely contains the kind of music that I 'll remember if I ever happen to hear it again . That 's when you know you have a great score.The supporting performances are fine as well , including Darren McGavin as the local drug pusher , Eleanor Parker as Frankie 's wheelchair-bound wife and Kim Novak as his lover . It 's interesting to see how filmmakers handled the subject of drug abuse , as opposed to modern attempts in films like " " Trainspotting " " and " " Requiem for a Dream . " " Back in 1955 , just mentioning the word " " drugs " " caused controversy , and if you watch the film they kept the subject on a very discreet level . There 's only one scene where Frankie is actually getting heroin injected into his arm , and they showed a close-up of the reaction of his face rather than showing the needle graphically poking into his veins . But it delivered its message without making it feel watered-down . In a powerful drama like this , with powerful performances and direction like this , you don 't need graphic portrayals of drug abuse to keep the audience intrigued . " " The Man with the Golden Arm " " is a dramatic gem that all film buffs should check out . It really is an amazing piece of work ! My score : 8 ( out of 10 ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" 1 . ) This movie was amazing ! I watched it while I was in the town next to the one where he grew up ! I went and saw the buildings that the story took place in . Overall , I loved this movie , One of Jake Gyllenhaal 's best ! ! Also- my favorite parts were the science fair , and all the times with his father . They were so sad , it seemed . Homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad didn 't seem to care one way or another . That tag line is true . " " Sometimes One Dream is bright enough to light up the sky . " " 2 . ) The way this movie was shot was impeccable , it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the 1950 's . Dress was accurate and they had their slang down too . Definitely recommend this movie ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Opening credits : great . Music : just right for this film . Cinematography : sleazy to great effect.Harrowing excitement in a train-wreck sort of way . This is how out of control some lives can become . " " Wonderland " " depicts drug-induced wildness ( and its consequences ) not as an aberration , but shows how it really does happen in our society . It is better than depictions of another wild group -Manson 's- because all Manson films , books etc concentrate so much on Manson 's insane mind rather than the overall picture of the cheap fame and randomness that is so pervasive nowadays.If you want to see some of the best " " Method-acting " " on film , watch Kilmer in this movie . He shows how " " The Method " " can be riveting in the right role.The filmmakers here succeed in raising " " out-of-control " " to the level of an art form , not just for the sake of giving us cheap thrills . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This time , the lovable dimwit gets summoned for jury duty , where a corrupt attorney notices that he looks like a jailbird who wants to break out , so the two get switched . Of course , most of the movie is a series of gags ; in " " Ernest Goes to Jail " , " most of the gags relate to electricity . I really liked the whole vacuum cleaner sequence early on . Overall , the point of the movie is just to have fun , and I 'm sure that you will . This is possibly the ultimate movie that you watch with a bud . It 's quite safe to say that Jim Varney will truly be missed . Knowwhaddamean ? FYI : the only other cast member whom I recognized was Randall " " Tex " " Cobb , who played Lyle .

" Having just come home from my third viewing of The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit , I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought . I noticed a lot of Brits loved it , while those in America just didn 't get it . That really doesn 't come as any shock , as America doesn 't get what " " English " " is.Wallace and Gromit are very English . Middle class English , in fact , with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure . The film is a lot like our two heroes ; simple and unassuming . It has a nice and gentle plot so the children don 't get lost , yet there 's enough beef there to keep the adults amused too . There 's some light innuendo ( which seems have to have offended the evangelic - oh noes , drama ! ) but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment . When people get offended by a plasticine anus , you know the world 's messed up ... One quick note to those ( all American so far that I have seen ) who think Chicken Run is a better film : Chicken Run was made to pander to your sense of humour , and I think it suffered because of it . Curse of the Were Rabbit is witty , English , and intelligent . Thomas The Tank Engine 's film was ruined because it was made to please the Americans and I 'm glad Nick Park did not let that happen to another Great British institution.To sum up : You can keep your Chicken Runs , your Shreks , your Madagasga 's - that kind of crude , crass , slapstick comedy just doesn 't compare to the wit and grace that is Wallace and Gromit in Curse of the Were-Rabbit . English to the core , and long may Wallace and Gromit stay that way . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Rock ' n ' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made ! I think the only reason it was so awesome was because of The Ramones !

The whole entire movie is about The Ramones ... especially Joey ! So everybody showed see Rock ' n ' Roll High School if your a huge fan of real PUNK .

" [ No Spoilers ] Being a David Lynch film , one could have the idea that it depicts that enigmatic mind of his like the majority of his feature films do . But it is a very straight story as the title might hint . Don 't except to be caught in the usual Lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing i.e. Lost Highway . It is a simple film but it is indeed a great film . That is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect . It 's innovative because it so not Lynch . But maybe that IS Lynch . He likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from Lynch himself . Being a very avantgarde director , he might just make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he doesn 't give it to them . That would be crafty.The pace of the film is slow . I would almost say lawn mower speed ... Don 't expect an action orgy , but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film . Look carefully for those small details that Lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment . Look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life . And listen to Badalamenti 's score and the main theme that really animates the Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes shown frequently . Farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film , making him one of the most likeable ol ' men ever depicted on film . He doesn 't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts . His cheerfulness just shines right through him and his acting earned him an Oscar nomination . Need I say that his weak health in this film wasn 't acted ? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete . That knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to Farnsworth . All of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done . One could ask for homilies that aren 't that obvious and a bit naive but it doesn 't ruin the overall picture , being that it is a memorable motion picture . 9 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In her first nonaquatic role , Esther Williams plays a school teacher who 's the victim of sexual assault . She gives a fine performance , proving she could be highly effective out of the swimming pool . As the detective out to solve the case , George Nader gives perhaps his finest performance . And he is so handsome it hurts ! John Saxon is the student under suspicion , and although he gets impressive billing in the credits , it 's Edward Andrews as his overly-protective father who is the standout.Bathed in glorious Technicolor , The Unguarded Moment is irresistible hokum and at times compelling drama . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Early Coppola with sublime cast that most folks never got to see ( a pity ) . There 's some wonderful things going on in this one - Shirley Knight 's best performance ( an underrated actress ) , a road trip in the late 1960 's , James Caan very restrained and moving , Robert Duvall in a part he was born to play ( edgy , lonely , motorcycle cop ) , and a touching script with F. Coppola behind the wheel.If this had been made five years LATER by some nobody , it would have been a smash ( so much for timing ) . Anyway , I recommend this to all people who don 't need outer-space explosions and bad mother-in-law jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold . Give this one a chance if you can find it ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" admittedly , I first picked up Ranma 1 / 2 when I was around twelve . I was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read . Then , I went to the Comic / Manga section and spotted this book . At my first few reads through the chapters I didn 't really know what was going on , but I knew that I LOVED it . I even took it home for a few more reads over . Frankly , I wasn 't getting anywhere . And then , about five months ( I 'm 16 now ) ago my friend was watching some anime series and I remembered about this Manga . I couldn 't remember what it was called , but recalled that the author was Rumiko Takahashi , creator of Inu Yasha . I Googled it , and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes . At first I was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics , but it didn 't really matter in the end . No anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind , watch again . I once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day . I don 't know how I did it ... but I couldn 't stop . Eventually , after about two days , I grew obsessed . I even dreamt--as crazy as this sounds--about watching Ranma . Never have I found a series so enjoyable , so funny , and so heartwarming to watch . To this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied . Of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers , but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading . Ranma 1 / 2 is about a boy named Ranma Saotome and his dad Genma Saotome . INTENSE martial artists . They are so intense , that they went to the ancient training grounds in China and became ' cursed ' . The grounds were full of different pools of springs , and if you land in one , you take the shape of whatever drowned there when doused in cold water . For Genma , that was a PANDA , and for Ranma that was a ... girl ! It 's a very crafty fun loving story . On top of that , Genma promises his friend that Ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the Tendo dojo alive . ' Course the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual . Obviously they start to like one another , but both way to stubborn to admit it . But .. Genma has a history of doing this . He promised Ranma to many girls . Trust me . It 's worth watching . It 's humorous , heartwarming and all around amazing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In my opinion , this is the best stand-up show I have ever seen . I became an instant Eddie fan after seeing Dress to Kill , but I must say I think this is his best work . I would say , though , if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live . It is worth it ! Most of the time after seeing a stand-up routine a couple times , the jokes start to get old . But I have to say , I 've seen this show SO many times that I literally have the entire thing memorized ( which yes , I realize is kinda sad ) but every joke still makes me laugh . This is truly a feel good show.Dress to Kill will never get old for me . I own it and watch it anytime I need a good laugh . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season . It celebrates a quality best described as plain old friendliness . Morgan Freeman plays a character very like Freeman himself--a successful actor pushing 70 . He has traveled to a small , rather grimy grocery store intending to research a part he might play , as a manager of such a place . He soon beguiles the staff and the customers , especially the lovely , if cranky , young woman ( Paz Vega ) who presides over the " " 10 items or less " " checkout lane.10 Items Or Less doesn 't have a big statement to make and doesn 't pretend that it does . It follows Freeman and Vega as they become friendly , and as the older man offers his counsel , in exchange for a ride home--the movie-company gofer who is supposed to pick him up never shows and Freeman has forgotten his own phone number so he can 't call for help . I had a little case of the blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York City and this flick cured what ailed me . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The great Vincent Price has done many fantastic Horror films , some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all-time . Price 's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s , with films such as Roger Corman 's brilliant Poe-cycle ( still the greatest Horror cycle of all-time ) , Michael Reeves ' " " Witchfinder General " " ( 1968 ) or Ubaldo Ragona 's " " The Last Man on Earth " " ( 1964 ) marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man 's career . The films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal Horror icon he is , however date back to the 50s , with " " House of Wax " " ( 1953 ) marking his rise to stardom . " " The Mad Magician " " of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor . This is not to say , however , that this film isn 't an original , delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself . As the lines above may suggest , Vincent Price is my favorite actor , and , while I personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in , none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem.Price stars as Don Galico ( aka . Galico the Great ) , an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices , whose boss , a sleazy businessman , stole his wife ( Eva Gabor ) from him . When the boss takes away one of Galico 's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival , The Great Rinaldi ( John Emery ) , Galico snaps , and a murderous spree of revenge begins ... Don 't we love Vincent Price when he 's out for revenge ? Some of his most famous and greatest films such as " " The Abominable Dr. Phibes " " ( 1971 ) or " " Theater of Blood " " ( 1973 ) were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders , and this earlier film in his Horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as Vincent Price does . This film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for Price , who , as always , delivers a brilliant performance , and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every Horror fan . Another must-see for my fellow Price fans . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The film has great special effects and acting from all of the film 's actors ! The baseball scenes are all realistic ! The music by composer Randy Edelman is very good and it fits the film very well ! Some of the actors who reminded Me the actual baseball personalities . Stoney Jackson 's Ray Mitchell character reminded Me Royce Clayton , McConaughey 's character reminded Me of Steve Finley , and Jay O.

" It 's sort of crazy , but I taped from TCM both , this german version of MGM 's " " Anna Christie " , " and the english one ... but I got to see this one first , ' cos I 'd heard that many people thought it was better than the english version.Without having seen the other one , I cannot compare them , but anyway this is an excellent early talkie , with a straight-from-the-heart performance by Garbo . She looks very beautiful in this film , her face shines throughout , especially when Cameraman William Daniels , gets those gorgeous close-ups of her.The atmosphere of the film seems different from the regular MGM stuff made on that era , it looks very similar to french or german expressionistic films from the thirties , well it was directed by a great french director , Monsieur Jacques Feyder , who had directed Garbo in 1929 in " " The Kiss " . " Theo Shall is excellent and gives an absolutelly believable performance as Anna 's sweetheart , the hard-boiled , tough , sailor , who 's just a kid in man 's body . Also Hans Junkermann gives a very fine performance , as Anna 's alcoholic father and Salka Viertel too , as a good-hearted old cheap floozie.In all quite an experience , because it 's the only film were you can listen to Garbo speak in a foreign language ... ' cos all the other films she did in either Sweden or Germany , were during the Silent Era.Serious Flick . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization . In reality , perhaps they are . After all , the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film . He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is . He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film , somebody is trying to kill him.There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real . There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures . These sequences add realism to the film in feeling.The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off . This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly clich챕 , but I was completely wrong ! Charlie Cox ( I had never heard of him until now ) played an incredibly good leading man ; he was so earnest and romantic , me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him.Claire Danes , who I did like before ( LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet ) , made me enjoy her even more . Her acting was fantastic , I couldn 't even tell that she was American . The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good , the casting was quite perfect.Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well-casted ; DeNiro as that gay pirate ... priceless , priceless . I laughed so hard at that one scene where Septimus comes on the ship ... oh my god , wow . Pfeiffer played a decent villain , I liked her as the snippy mother in Hairspray . But she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie . Overall , it was funny ( but not slap-stick at all ! ) , romantic , the special effects weren 't totally frequent but when they were , they were great ; the cameos from Ricky Gervais and Peter O 'Toole were also well-placed . I totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings .

" Any Way the Wind Blows is Tom Barmans ( who is also know as front man of the rock formation ' dEUS ' ) debut movie . Entirely shot in Antwerp ( Belgium ) , the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters . When the movie ends , you have a lot of stuff to think about , because most of the different story-lines are left wide open.The movie has a ( purely instrumental ) sound track that will rock your socks off . In most scenes , the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel , really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time . The main scene in the film , the party , is very well shot.The director didn 't hesitate to use video clip techniques , having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks I 've heard lately.The screenplay is great stuff . Camera angles and colors are very well chosen . The ' costumes ' are very hot and very ' seventies ' too . And I loved ( most of the ) acting.The thing I liked most about the movie , are the subtle touches of absurd , surreal , very dry or even cynical humor that interleave.Without claiming to be a comedy ( this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art ) , it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times.This is one more directors ' debut that shouldn 't be an ending . I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future because I had a good time . Cheers . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What a wonderful movie , eligible for so many labels it never gets : Science fiction , film-noir , with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated , cultured audience ..... the kind of English language movie only done in pre-1960 England ( and shown only in USA art movie houses when it first arrived ) , and never , ever done in the USA.Main characters in The Man In The White Suit ( 1951 ) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysyllabic , science reference words like " " polymer " " and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like " " long chain molecules " " and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him.The Man In The White Suit ( 1951 ) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now ( 2009 ) dominate world cinema , and certainly dominate major USA cinema ....... it 's a carefully acted , intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated English actors ( who play educated , accomplished people ) , and it 's all done with comedy , charm , pathos , and sense of irony which ancient Greek dramatists would have approved of.Everybody should see this movie , and someday , somehow , some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it.It 's wonderful . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The fourth of five westerns Anthony Mann did with James Stewart , this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska , via Seattle . He hooks up in Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum ( Walter Brennan ) and Rube Morris ( Jay C. Flippen ) that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip , north.But first , he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands , cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy , manipulative Ronda Castle ( Ruth Roman ) who believes Jeff could be a valuable ally in the future . That 's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain 's looking for him for the earlier ( and justifiable ) killing of a trail hand.Jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy Judge Gannon ( John McIntire ) who runs the town of Skagway , Alaska . Gannon locks Jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town . He fines Jeff the ownership of his cattle and Jeff just has to eat crow for the time being . In the meantime , Jeff agrees to ride point for Ronda up to Dawson in order to deliver supplies . But this is just a ruse so Jeff , Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal his cattle back . Of course Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle while Ben races the cattle over the Canadian border out of Gannon 's reach.After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other Skagway men , they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder , which just happens to be Ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in Dawson . Jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold . But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get in on the gold action up there , and tells Jeff that he was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try his luck up in the Klondike , himself . That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner 's claims . Jeff and Ben now feel it 's time to clear out while the goings are good , leaving Rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang.They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon 's men because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth . Ben is killed and Jeff is severely wounded but that doesn 't save Judge Gannon from his just due . The ending shootout at night on the muddy Dawson street pretty much takes care of that . First Jeff kills two of Gannon 's best gunman ( Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie ) . Then as Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip around behind him , Gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in Jeff 's arms . Then Jeff kills Gannon as he 's hiding under a wooden sidewalk . Revenge has spoken.This is another rip-roaring western that 's right up there with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE . Why the Universal DVD uses a pan-and-scan print instead of the widescreen print TCM uses , is beyond me . You 'll wind up missing half the glorious Alberta cinematography by William Daniels . So if you like well-written 50s westerns , then this one 's an A-list keeper . 8 out of 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you 're OK with the outlandish work of Italy 's premier horror director혰able to accept his outrageous story lines and flamboyant style혰then you should have a great time with Opera . If you don 't , then you won 't.Cristina Marsillach plays Betty , a beautiful young opera understudy who is given a shot at fame ( in an avant-garde production of Macbeth ) when the star of the show is hit by a car . As any thesp who has ' trod the boards ' will know , Macbeth is a production that carries a curse혰and Betty soon discovers that the show in which she is now the star is no exception : a killer is systematically offing the staff at the theatre혰and poor Betty is forced to watch by the sadistic murderer ( who tapes needles under her eyes to prevent her from closing them ! ) .With the help of a little girl who crawls through her air-conditioning ducts , her director and agent , and a few ravens who have seen the murderer 's face ( ! ! ! ) , Betty discovers the killer 's identity , and the truth about her mysterious past.Let 's face it ... Opera is one crazy film , with its preposterous plot-turns , convoluted death scenes , and an ending that beggars belief . And whilst director Dario Argento has never been one for , shall we say , conventional story lines , this particular giallo is so daft , and features so many of his trademark stylish touches ( all ramped up to the max ) , that it 's almost as if , with each successive film , he is seeing what he can get away with ( at times almost parodying his earlier work ) .This is exactly why I find the film such fun ! ! ! Argento 's camera movements are absolutely incredible : gliding , creeping and , in one amazing scene , even swooping around the opera house above the audience ; the power of Verdi 's music is combined perfectly with the synth majesty of Claudio Simonetti 's score , providing a suitably grandiose accompaniment to the sumptuous visuals ; and several outstanding set-pieces ( featuring Sergio Stivaletti 's nauseating gore FX ) go to prove that no-one does death better than Argento ( check out one character 's stunning demise , in which a bullet passes through a spy-hole in a door in slow motion , and straight into their eye ! ) .7.5 out of 10 , rounded up to 8 for IMDb . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Christopher Nolan 's directorial debut is a memorable one . The film was very well received and help land contracts for making ' Memento ' and quite rightfully so . Following is an exquisite example of how films should be made . No fancy effects or blood-dripping gore ... just brilliant writing and good acting . Nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing . The actors , all unknowns to me and I suppose most people , did a good job bringing the characters to live . They were all believable and that 's all they need to be . The film is confusing because it plays with chronology a lot but it 's very rewarding in the end . The film 's a little short to be a full-length feature but any additional length would 've ruined the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing would 've been diminished . Though short , the film has every aspect that makes a film attractive ( IMO ) : an intriguing beginning , an exciting middle and a surprising end . I dare say Following is almost as good as Memento , his best film by far . The scrambled chronology is equally masterful used in both films , the amazing plot twists are present and the acting is very good.This film was made with a mere $ 6000 but the quality is much higher than most ( almost all ) million dollar box-office hits . The use of b & w may be a hard pill to swallow for the big audience , following is primarily Nolan showing off his skills to the studio bosses : - ) . And what skills they are ... rarely have I enjoyed writing so much as in ' Following ' . Even Pi doesn 't even come close IMO , though it 's also very good.This is a film surely not to be missed by any self-respecting movie-lover . If you liked Memento , ' Following ' is definitely for you . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've read every adventure of Asterix and Obelix at least 5 times and I 'm also a fan of " " Les Nuls " " and " " Les Robins des Bois " " and Jamel so I expected a lot from this movie .... and I finally got satisfied . Unlike the first adaptation of Asterix on the big screen ( Ast챕rix et Ob챕lix contre C챕sar ) which wasn 't a real success besides the appearance of Laetitia Casta , this one really captures the spirit of the comic ( and we get the beautiful Monica Bellucci ) . In the first movie the director tried to be too realistic about the time where the story is set and it killed the whole spirit that made Asterix hilarious . In this one all the clothing , the way of talking and everything is identical to Goscinny and Uderzo 's work ... more , it really stick to the original story with the downside that we know pretty much everything that 's going to happen but Alain Chabat gave us a few surprises at the end . I really enjoyed that movie , and everytime that the first sign of boringness starts to appear , Jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy . This movie is a big mix of all the kind of humor I really like , and even if maybe it 's mixing it too much , I can 't help but to like it . So , if you like Asterix and the humor of all these young talents that started in " " Nulle part Ailleurs " " ( a french mix of the tonight show and SNL ) go see this movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I don 't know what I missed here , but I can 't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film . I thought it was silly , and a bit over the top . I did like the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker , however the others were just ... boring.Now I like B movies , I really do , but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me . I saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to " " Army Of Darkness " " and " " Shaun of the Dead " , " as well as " " On par with The Re-Animator " . " You must be joking . I didn 't find this film funny , it tried , it did make an effort , ( possibly too much of an effort ) , but it failed in my opinion . By the time I was hit with the 3rd or 4th one-liner I was rolling my eyes and checking my watch.There were definitely homages made to several other films , which is always cool , kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans . But here it may have just been a lack of original thought . Admittedly there were some nice special effects , good gore , but that can 't carry an entire movie . The mutated Grant looked like a cross between Jabba the Hut , and in the early stages of mutation- Chet from " " Weird Science " " ( after he was turned into the monster ) and one of the alien creature / children from " " The Explorers " . " It just didn 't work . I thought it looked like something some kid from Grade 5 art class could have designed . Then there was Brenda , the woman that Grant impregnated and chained up in the barn . When help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped . The design once again was totally unimaginative . A round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle . * yawn * Now about the zombies- The more movies I see with zombies in them these days the more I wish George A. Romero had a patent on them and was the only writer / director allowed to make movies about them . He 's the only person so far to do it right , with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg ( but that was a comedy ) . Oh , and Danny Boyle , but they were a different style of Zombie . Maybe Mr. Romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan , groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid , and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were re-animated . The people of " " Wheelsy " " just didn 't have the proper motivation ... they were horrible zombies.So in the end I give " " Slither " " a 3 , for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just watched Antwone Fisher on BRAVO . What an awesome movie and incredible young man . This movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult . Denzel Washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays Antwone Fisher . Kleenex alert--Feel good and tearful . The most heartrending moment is when he finally meets his mother , who he was taken away from at 2 months of age .

" Paha maa is different Finnish film . But the things which makes it different are copied abroad . Some techniques of narration are from Amores Perros , Jackie Brown and Elephant . Scenes are shot from different angles again . Paha maa is a good movie , but it isn 't so good that the hype tolds : " " Realistic movie , no happy end , and no commercial admissions . " " Some actors did great job . Sulevi Peltola was so good as a vacuum cleaner peddler . Also Jasper P채채kk철nen shows his skills . But Mikko Leppilampi was so lame . He is so overrated actor , he 's handsome and a nice guy , but not the best actor of Finland . But if you like Finnish movies , Paha maa is worth to see . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ira Levin 's Deathtrap is one of those mystery films in the tradition of Sleuth that would be very easy to spoil given any real examination of the plot of the film . Therefore I will be brief in saying it concerns a play , one man who is a famous mystery playwright , another man who is a promising writer , the playwright 's wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been , and one German psychic along for the ride . Director Sidney Lumet , no stranger to film , is quite good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs to motor on . The dialog is quick , fresh , and witty . Michael Caine excels in roles like these . Christopher Reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him act . Irene Worth stands out as the funny psychic . How about Dyan Cannon ? Love how Lumet packaged her posterior in those real tight-fitting pants and had her wear possibly the snuggest tops around , but she is terribly miscast in this role - a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive . But why quibble with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it now ? Deathtrap is funny , sophisticated , witty , and classy . The mystery has some glaring flaws which do detract somewhat , and I was not wholly satisfied with the ending , but watching Caine and Reeve under Lumet 's direction with Levin 's elevated verbiage was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it captive the entire length of the film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" 044 : The Big Trail ( 1930 ) - released 10 / 24 / 1930 ; viewed 4 / 5 / 06.BIRTHS : Richard Harris , Harold Pinter , Robert Atkins.DOUG : In Hollywood , Raoul Walsh unveiled his latest film , The Big Trail , a western about the trek west across the frontier , starring up-and-coming 23-year-old actor John Wayne . In 1930 , we are seeing many " " firsts " " but few " " bests . " " Besides the first John Wayne film , we have here the first widescreen film ( although we only watched the full-frame version ) . Interestingly , the decision to film in widescreen was essentially the same reason that widescreen became popular later : to compete with television , which hadn 't yet appeared commercially but was still an emerging curiosity . All the same , this film was extremely good , giving us a harrowing look at the trek to Oklahoma . The opening title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional kind , about America , about the land , who should live on it , etc . , and is an excellent demonstration of that . Walsh gives us some astonishing visuals of the wagon company out in the wilderness ( when they reach a cliff , they must rope each wagon down one by one ) , and we also get a revenge subplot involving Wayne pursuing the man who killed one of his friends ( I seem to recall something similar in Stagecoach ) . Wayne 's tough cowboy routine is at least partly there , and would surely evolve further in subsequent films . Since this film is representing all of Wayne 's early 30 's work for the Odyssey , we will not see his face again until Stagecoach , but once we do , we will keep seeing him to the end of the Odyssey and beyond.KEVIN : Ah , our first sound western , and John Wayne 's first starring role . It 's Raoul Walsh 's The Big Trail . This review will be short , since it 's been weeks since I watched it . I enjoyed this movie , but it was far from a masterpiece . The mostly predictable adventure had a few surprises , like when the brains of the bad guys , Red Flack ( Tyrone Power Sr. in his last role ) is killed half way through ; I thought he would be the boss at the end , but that ended up being Bill Thorpe ( Ian Keith ) . I remember that I didn 't like the way Breck ( Wayne ) kills Thorpe and exacts revenge at the end . I understood that that 's what he was meant to do in the story , but I really didn 't like his reasoning when he tells Ruth why he has to do it . I think he had a far greater responsibility to the hundreds of settlers he was leading through the harsh west.Last film viewed : Animal Crackers ( 1930 ) . Last film chronologically : Soup to Nuts ( 1930 ) . Next film : L 'Age D 'or ( 1930 ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Since it has been some years since I reviewed this classic I have decided to go back and review it more in dept , but first some insider notes from a movie critic.This animated series is one of those that I grew up with , it made my childhood joyful , it made it awesome , miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don 't see as much as we did back in the days , well on to the review ... Talespin , or Luftens Helte which it is called in Denmark is a great animated series , it is much like chip and dale , ducktales and a lot of those old ones , so it has that weird feeling surrounding it , i cannot remember this series as much as I would like to remember it.But in my opinion it was very great , it came with some kind of message , not that wild of a message , however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven.Now i don 't want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons , today we see something like Ed Edd and Eddy or anything else weird like that , we have all these new or nearly new shows like Hannah Montana or something like that , yet I feel like that we don 't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days.Now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much , to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like Talespin being released again to the TV screen instead of all the new ones , give me back my childhood cartoons , give them to the kids i have some day , give them again ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of the most timely and engrossing documentaries , you 'll ever watch . While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas , it provides an intimate look into political dynamics , that prevail throughout the western Hemisphere . While essentially another chapter in the story of the " " U.S. backed , Latin American coup " , " this film chronicles in real-time , what can happen when the poorest people , are armed with unity , political savvy , and courage ! The political insights offered by this film are invaluable . One gets clear examples of the private media , as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda . We see the poor people of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of " " American politics " . " One gets a clear sense of impending doom , if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny , which has been abruptly , and illegally , thrust upon them by the conspirators . We also see the arrogance and fascism , of the CIA backed , private media , plutocrats , and generals , who 've conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington 's domination . Though ably led by President Hugo Chavez , the people of Caracas are forced to act without him , after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals . Their response is the highpoint of the film .

" What 's with all the negative comments ? After having seen this film for the first time tonight , I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person 's day . When I saw that Drew ( Ben Affleck ) might end up spending the holidays alone , I wanted to cry . You 'll have to see the movie if you want to know why . Also , even though I liked Tom ( James Gandolfini ) and Alicia ( Christina Applegate ) after awhile , if you ask me , they were real snobs . However , this film did make me smile and feel good inside . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say that Mike Mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit . Now , in conclusion , I highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person 's day to any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who hasn 't seen it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I blame " " Birth of a Nation " " myself - for commencing the long-running tradition of Hollywood travesties of history , of which there can be few greater examples than this . Apart from getting the names of Custer and his 7th Cavalry , Crazy Horse and the Sioux and President Grant spelt right , the geography correct and the fact that Custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man , the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits . Throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition , ( try Custer and his wife 's learning of the phony " " Gold Rush " " to excuse the invasion of the Sioux territory , Custer 's testimony in front of Congress pleading the rights of the Red Indians and to top it all , Custer 's storming into the president 's office to beg to return to his post ) , honestly there 's plenty more of the same , some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness ... ... And yet , and yet , it 's still a great actioner with Flynn as dashing as ever , DeHavilland as beguiling as ever , the young Anthony Quinn getting a start as Crazy Horse and director Walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences . Ford taught us in " " Liberty Valance " " to believe the legend before the truth . Here I think we 're closer to the legend of the legend but hey , it 's only a movie and a rollicking , wonderfully enjoyable classic Hollywood movie at that ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it . This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another . The three leads ( Barbora Bobulova as Valeria , Brigitte Catillon as Flavia , Andrea Renzi as Massimo ) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising . After all the movies which devalue older women , it 's wonderful to see Flavia ( who is a law professor at a university in Rome ) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful . We 're conditioned to believe that when a younger woman enters ' the mix , ' the older woman will become jealous of the younger woman , the man will leave the older woman for the younger woman , etc , etc . In this film , however , emotional truth is considerably more complex . Highly recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was really looking forward to watching this documentary on what I considered to be some of the most entertaining films ever made . Growing up in L.A. during the 60 's many of these old black and white films were shown on the local stations . I even remember a Friday night show called " " Strange Tales of Science Fiction " " that showcased a different Sci Fi flick every week . This documentary however spent way too much time on the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic movies of that genre and how they used them as inspiration in their filmaking.That is not what I was hoping for in this documentary . It really could have been a comprehensive examination of the decade instead of a brief highlighting of the most well known films of the era . Anyone who has studied or been interested in these films are pretty familiar with standouts such as War of the Worlds , Forbidden Planet , The Thing , The Day the Earth Stood Still , etc . I would have liked to see some excerpts from lesser known films and perhaps some interviews with people involved in the making of these movies . I would have to agree the documentary was way too focused on Spielberg 's opinions and was a type of commercial for his new release of War of the Worlds . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The Squire of Gothos is one of the " " sillier " " episodes of Star Trek , and therefore one of the most entertaining ones . The entertainment factor is , generally speaking , fueled by the stand-off between William Shatner and the episode 's hilarious guest star , William Campbell.During an unspecified routine mission , Sulu suddenly vanishes into thin air , and Kirk follows soon after-wards . Spock immediately begins looking for his missing colleagues ( and , though he 'd hate to admit it , friends ) , while the two stranded crewmen must deal with the mysterious , all-powerful , flamboyant Trelane ( Campbell ) , the self-proclaimed Squire of Gothos , a being capable of creating or destroying anything he wants through the sheer power of his mind.At first sight , the plot may seem recycled from previous episodes ( honestly , are there any sci-fi shows that didn 't feature at least one God-like character ) , but that feeling vanishes pretty quickly thanks to the script 's winning use of exaggerated humor , all conveyed through Campbell 's deliberately camp performance : his Trelane is essentially the Trek version of a spoiled child in the body of an adult , while his ignorance-fueled curiosity for the human race ( his knowledge is quite limited ) probably served as inspiration for Gene Roddenberry when he came up with the character of Q for the Next Generation pilot , some two decades after this episode aired.In short , the key to appreciating The Squire of Gothos is this : " " silly " " doesn 't necessarily equal " " bad " .

I loved that they tackled the dynamics of how the members in the men 's group dealt with each other , considering this was directed by a lesbian , the whole theme of masculinity was put out there , ridiculed , dissected and questioned . What makes a man ? What makes one straight , gay , or bisexual ? You aren 't really sure if our lead character has decided on who he really wants ; he 's living in the moment and thrown caution to the wind . These , and other reasons , make me love this film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Early in the movie , Cagney 's Johnny Cave character tells his gumshoes in the Office of Weights and Measures that in the previous year , unscrupulous shop owners had cheated the American consumer out of more money than the aggregate National War Debt ! Then he goes out and tickets a particularly greasy green grocer for short-selling him a bag of sugar that is four ounces off ( oh , the horrors ! ! ) and one skinny chicken that his butcher 's scale has rather generously proclaimed to be six lbs . , after which the fur--or in this case feathers--flies . Er , fly . When a racketeer in politician 's clothing attempts to derail an investigation into the paltry poultry purveyor 's practices , our hero becomes a lone wolf waging the war of the weights on behalf of housewives across America . After all , four cents here and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have anarchy ! Word of his intransigence soon reaches both the Mayor and the Governor 's offices , and Cagney becomes a marked man . If it sounds silly , it 's not--the dishonest retailing practices are only a plot tool ( or as Hitchcock would say , the McGuffin ) and while unfamiliar , it works every bit as well here as any Treasury Agent or G-man anthology in which the fight is taken to shady crooks who are operating outside the interests of the country 's common good . The production standards are decidedly Grade-B , but it is Cagney who makes this movie the delight that it is : this was his first film away from Warner Brothers after seeking release in court from his unreasonable contract , and he seems to be at ease and enjoying himself tremendously--the performance turned in here is intelligent and crackles with his unique energy and surefire charisma . Mae Clarke 's presence lends a definite Warner 's feel to the overall production . The supporting players turn in solid performances and the story moves along smartly after a rocky introduction that seems to begin three or four reels into the story--but sit back and enjoy it for the Cagney showcase and engaging Depression-era time capsule that it is . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan . Kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes . A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game . It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact . City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease . A detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles . Streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community . Regardless of outcome , you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film 's protagonist . Richard Widmark as Dr.Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers . Barbera Bel Geddis as Reed 's wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of ( restful more than comic ) relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the New Orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer Joe McDonald . Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic . Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie ( Black Death ? ) is simply outstanding . With riveting intensity Palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well . In addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity , especially in the film 's powerful final allegorical moments . Panic in the Streets is probably Kazan 's best non-Brando film . It 's tension filled , suspensefully well paced and edited . It 's ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with Panic he succeeds with aplomb . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera 's Eve watching an amazing drama unfold . It began with Shyama ( a winsome Nandita Das ) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance . Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child . Several years later we see Amudha , a playful well-loved child ( P. S. Keerthana ) , who is the darling ( or burden ) of teachers , parents and fellow schoolmates alike , in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence . On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru ( Madhavan ) and Indra ( Simran ) that she is not their biological child , she was adopted . This tilts her confident love-filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her . Several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her birth mother . The country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess . But this also leads to their meeting the new Shyama - one who finally is confronted by Amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughter.The story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth , her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother , the unconditional love of the adoptive parents , the demons that drive the birth mother , the normalcy of Chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring . AR Rahman 's music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film . The film has excellent performances from Madhavan , Nandita Das , Simran and an absolute stunner role as Amudha - the abandoned one - done by the child artiste P. S. Keerthana . This performance won her a National award.The cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot . I am intrigued by the connection Mani Ratnam has with terrorism , love and obsessions . I think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding . Mahadevan 's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish , rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl . His one liners were hilarious . The mother played by Simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic , loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids . The shock , angst , and obsession of the child Amudha was outstandingly portrayed by P. S. Keerthana . Her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking . In fact the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das , and her husband . Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes . It also kept him from being judgmental - this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy.Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - I rarely weep in the movies , but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick . This is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy ; beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this at a test screening in Chatsworth a week or so ago , and went with a bunch of my girlfriends. we all really loved it a lot . James Franco is amazing and so hot , I would see it just for him ! ! ! ! ! ! ! but Sienna Miller is also really good and plays a southern girl who is in love with him so much that she can 't let go . David Caradine who was in Kill Bill plays a cowboy and he is perfect for that . The story is kind of strange but if you believe in the power of love and magical things you will love it ! ! ! It is really original , and it is also very funny and everyone laughed a lot but by the end it gets more serious and we all ended up crying . I am going to see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out , it is really good ! ! ! ! ! ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I accidently felt on this movie on TV , and I wasn 't able to leave it .... It 's really an excellent movie which makes people learning about american 's history with the Vietnam war , the flower power 's time , the racism 's fight .... It illustrates the conflict of generation , of political opinion , of race which took place in the 60 's .... I 'm born in 1980 so I didn 't know all that stuff before ... In france , USA 's history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts ! By the way , I think all the actors are great ; especially Jordana Brewster , Josh Hamilton and Jerry O 'Connell . Now I can see this film more then 1 time each day ! ! It 's really great .... what a shame it only appeared on TV not in cinemas ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Aaron Carter plays the pop star ( J.D. McQueen ) in this movie ( surprise surprise ) . This is a typical movie where the leading lady ( Jane ) has a huge crush on J.D. McQueen the pop star ( as well as many other girls ) but she 's the lucky one that gets to spend the days with J.D. and forms a relationship with him that is more like a fantasy . J.D. has to go to a public school to keep his math grade up in order to do his summer tour . Problem is J.D. isn 't good at math . He finds the smartest person in school ( Jane ) to tutor him . Jane tutors and falls in love with J.D. J.D. in return falls in love with as well but J.D. screws up and has to fix everything in order to win the girl and make the summer tour . The movie is definitely worth watching . Aaron will be a GREAT actor ! ! ! , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The only show I have watched since 90210 ! Why did they discontinue it ? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all ! The least they should do is release it on DVD ! I checked out similar shows , but nothing has come close . The cast had incredible chemistry and I looked forward to each episode with much anticipation . They made a big mistake by pulling that show . If anyone has any info regarding where I can obtain a DVD of North Shore please post a few lines here . Thanks ! Aloha ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sur mes l챔vres or READ MY LIPS is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of ' outsiders ' , people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to ' fit in ' . Director Jacques Audiard with and co-writer Tonino Benacquista have created a tense , tight , completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights.Carla ( Emmanuelle Devos ) is a plain Jane , mostly deaf , thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak . Enter Paul ( Vincent Cassel ) a recent released ex-con parolee who responds to an ad to be Carla 's assistant . There is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting : Carla had hoped for a well-groomed , genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and Paul is a coarse , unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk . Their concepts change rather quickly when Paul salvages Carla 's job by filling her request to steal a letter that would cost her her job and Paul discovers Carla 's lip reading ability which he sees as a way to spy on the criminals from his past who threaten his life for money owed . So this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain Paul 's safety and freedom . The relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising ways.Devos and Cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong . Once again Alexandre Desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer Mathieu Vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the Hitchcockian sense of suspense . Director Audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story : he shows us the difference between ' hearing ' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments . This is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the French film noir genre . Recommended . Grady Harp , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" WOW ! This film is the best living testament , I think , of what happened on 9-11-01 in NYC , compared to anything shown by the major media outlets.Those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside . This film shows you what happened on the INSIDE . It begins with a focus on a rookie New York fireman , waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight . The subject matter turns abruptly with the ONLY EXISTING FOOTAGE OF THE FIRST PLANE TO HIT THE TOWERS . You are then given a front-row seat as firefighters rush to the scene , into the lobby of Tower One . In the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane , and Tower Two 's subsequent fall , you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby . It is a sight you will not soon forget.Heart-rending , tear-jerking , and very compelling from the first minute to the last , " " 9 / 11 " " deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made.We must never forget . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This was one of the first CREEPY movies I ever saw ... I was about 5 at the time . It scared me GOOD ! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster ... and my mom got very upset . She had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like DOUBLE MINT ! NOW THAT 'S A MOVIE ! Hey for it 's time it was a great movie . That Head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then . And IF your 5 it is VERY SCARY !

" Dekalog Five was an interesting viewing experience for me , because of the question Kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience . Three men are the focus of this chapter , and Kieslowski present the two involved in murder with traits both good and bad ( In one 's case , almost overwhelmingly bad ) . With such vile characters , I found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment . However , when the time comes for the murder ( And it 's subsequent effect on the murderer ) , Kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my view , " " Are you not as guilty as this man ? " " This sort of indirect address of the audience makes the finale of Dekalog Five that much more profound as Kieslowski ( As usual ) doesn 't stay within the literal confines of his theme . Just as the other parts of the Dekalog don 't take their Commandment 's theme in it 's literal sense , neither does Dekalog Five . It asks us what is murder , who is more guilty of murder , and what should be the appropriate punishment , if any ? It 's a fantastic film and , typical of Kieslowski , absolutely stunning . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully crafted historical documentary . The shear beauty and horror of one mans walk through life , are revealed in totality . Dieter and Herzog are combined and connected through a mental maze that has been transformed into a single straight hallway which the walls have been plastered with images created by one mans characterization of himself by the vibrations of his own vocal chords . This film , for about 80 minutes , have discovered a new dimension of storytelling . What do I call this apparently new sense . Only God knows , after all , isn 't a MIRACLE something that God does for us , but chooses to remain ANONYMOUS ? This is a requirement to see . If you like to experience the lovely horror of war , this documentary will cleanse your soul to the marrow . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Possibly the most brilliant thing about Che : Part Two , as we begin to integrate it with Part One in our minds , is that there is no clarification of why Che chose to confidentially abscond from Cuba after the revolution , no allusion to his experience in the Congo , no clarification of why he chose Bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d 'etat , no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across South America , which Walter Salles has given prominent familiarity . Extraordinary focus is given to Che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions . Yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals , to establish involved relationships . He is reasonably unreasonable . Che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind . But there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men . It is the concept.In Part 1 , in Cuba , the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages , given food and cover , supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution . Here , in Bolivia , not much understanding is apparent . Villagers expose him . They protect government troops , not his own . When he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system , his audience appears uninterested . You cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply . Soderbergh shows U.S. military advisers working with the Bolivians , but doesn 't fault the United States for Che 's collapse . Che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it.In showcasing both wars , Soderbergh doesn 't build his battle scenes as actions with specific results . Che 's men attack and are attacked . They exchange fire with faraway assailants . There is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat , its death toll not paused for . This is not a war movie . It is about one man 's reasonably unreasonable drive to endure . There is no elaborate cinematography . Soderbergh looks firmly at Che 's inflexible dedication . There are remarkable sporadic visceral shots , but being few they are all the more powerful , such as Che 's POV shot during his final beats . There is an abundance of the terrain , where these men live for weeks at a time , and the all-consuming effect is of languor , Guevara himself having malaria part of the time.Benicio Del Toro , one of the film 's producers , gives a champion 's performance , not least because it 's modest . He isn 't portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes . In Cuba , he arises in conquest , in Bolivia , he falls to the reverse , and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair . Del Toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude . You may think the film is too long . I think there 's a genuine cause for its breadth . Guevara 's affairs in Cuba and particularly Bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches , but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane . In the end , Che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie , one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her stuff in this late ( 1928 ) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful William Haines . Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines . They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is " " discovered " " and becomes a big dramatic star . A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretentions . Davies & Haines are a wonderful team ( too bad they never made a talkie together ) and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin , Douglas Fairbanks , William S. Hart , John Gilbert , Elinor Glynn , and Marion Davies ( you have to see it ) are a hoot .

" My giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature-length films from 1930 . By the standards of films made just a few years later , this film might receive a score of only 6 or 7--mostly because the sound quality was so poor . Now it is possible that the film sounded better and the Fox Movie Channel did show a degraded print ( it DID have a lot of lines and scratches ) , but I assume the sound problem was always an issue . That 's because sound in movies was still a novelty in 1930 and many of the Hollywood talking pictures of 1930 sounded terrible--with background characters often drowning out the leads , characters huddled together to make sure they are picked up by the microphones or inconsistent quality ( such as what was seen in THE BISHOP MURDER CASE , HELL 'S ANGELS and other films of the day ) . This was all made much worse in THE BIG TRAIL because most of the film was shot outside--something unheard of at the time . Quite an innovation but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound technicians ! So , while the film was very hard to listen to , I realize that they had to start somewhere , so I can forgive this--especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking--a major innovation for 1930.The plot is rather similar to CIMARRON--a Western that came out the following year and which captured the Oscar for Best Picture . Unfortunately , CIMARRON isn 't all that great a film and I actually like THE BIG TRAIL more due to the scope of the film . While some might balk at THE BIG TRAIL 's slow-moving pace , I saw it as a great history lesson about the hardships endured by those traveling West on wagon trains . Plus , the whole thing just looked so beautiful , as director Raoul Walsh went to significant trouble to film on location and THE BIG TRAIL looks almost like a film version of some Ansel Adams prints.As for the acting , it was pretty good . This was a major break for young John Wayne--as his previous screen appearances were , at best , minor and unremarkable . Here , he was given the lead and did a dandy job--though he was obviously young and a little less " " John Wayne-ish " " than he was in later films , as his screen persona was not yet firmly established . Another interesting part was played by Tyrone Power II ( Tyrone Power 's father ) . He looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like Bluto from the Popeye cartoons ! He made very few sound films--dying just a year after making this film--so it 's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor.Overall , the film is well worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few overly long scenes here and there . For 1930 , it was a remarkable achievement--more so than the much more famous and award-winning CIMARRON made the following year . Much of the reason THE BIG TRAIL didn 't win an Oscar most likely was because ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT came out the same year and it is truly one of the great films . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I don 't know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but I enjoyed this one as I 'm a fan of urban horror . There 's not too many urban horror movies out there so when I saw this one on the shelf , just the title alone peaked my curiosity . So I decided to check it out and I was surprised ... it 's not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with GREAT acting and a good story . Is it low budget ? yes . Can you tell that it 's low budget ? Yes ... but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn 't matter . I like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice ! I don 't know what 's up with all these bad reviews for this film . All I hear is " " worst movie ever " . " Have these idiots seen EVERY movie out there ? There 's thousands of movies out there , how can you categorize one as the " " worst " " ever ? A video not " " movie " " like " " zombiez " " may be the worst film I ever SEEN but I can 't say that it 's the worst movie EVER since I haven 't seen every movie out there . Bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs . Listen , if you don 't like minority based , urban films , the ghetto films , hip hop , etc then WHY WATCH THESE TYPES OF MOVIES ? ? ? ! ! ! knowing that you don 't like this type of stuff ? Sure , this is a horror film but it 's not just a horror film but it 's an URBAN horror film with a multi-cultural based cast . I don 't like TV shows like Dawson 's Creek or the O.C. , THEY SUCK to me . Films like " " Garden State " , " " " Wedding Crashers " " and " " I heart huckabees " " SUCK to me . I 'm a guy from New Jersey and these shows and movies suck to me . Why ? Because I can 't relate to them . They don 't peak my interest . Just common sense . Believe me , I will never watch GARDEN STATE 2 : GARDEN SALAD , WEDDING CRASHERS 2 : Here 's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and I HEART HUCKABORING . Now back to this movie , in regards to saint405 's comment above , I don 't know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked " " stupid " " by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me , everyone did a great job . The actor who played Ricky ( I forgot his name ) did a VERY good job . I 'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and I had to do a play where I had to cry and it 's not easy to be emotional in a scene so I give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off .

" Man With the Gun is pretty much forgotten now , but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when Robert Mitchum turned down both Jett Rink in Giant ( which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked ) and Charles Laughton 's intended version of The Naked and the Dead to make it instead . Despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both Mitch and Jan Sterling in unflattering tones , it 's a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier Blood on the Moon as his ' town tamer ' sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to 혯 possibly 혯 be almost as bad as the men he dispatches . Certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family 혯 burning a saloon to the ground and goading its manager into trying to kill him 혯 doesn 't inspire much confidence in his stability . As well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast Henry Hull , it also boasts a strikingly good early Alex North score , which even includes an early workout for one of his tormented emotional cues that would later turn up in Spartacus . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Where do I begin ? Let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features on the DVD -- my wife and I watched the whole film again with the director 's commentary running . I can 't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film . It 's worth hearing.I 'm not a southern boy , but I spent some time around Memphis a long time ago , and have a feel for the area . This film almost smells of the South , it 's so real . Samuel Jackson , one of my all-time favorite actors , is magnificent as the emotionally bent Lazarus , and Christina Ricci gives the performance of a lifetime as Rae , a woman who 's been wounded severely during her brief life . I 've always liked Ms. Ricci 's work , but in this performance she 's giving 137 % of herself every second she 's on the screen . Awards and little statues are not enough to reward her for what she lays before the audience in this film . There are other places where you can read the essence of the story , so I 'm just commenting on the work . I 'd heard the name Justin Timberlake before seeing " " BSM , " " but had no idea what he looked like , or even why he 's famous . Bumping my head on 60 years old , I 'm outside his target demographic , to say the least . After seeing this film I will recognize him . He can act ! He gives a substantial , believable performance as the loving soulmate of the county slut . The director is from Memphis , and shows reverence for his home region . He is also a fine story teller ...... and I MUST mention the music . I love Blues , and the soundtrack for Black Snake Moan is a veritable feast for a blues fan .

If you watch the show for the value it contains as a TV show , and nothing more , it is very entertaining , much like movies such as Old School , Porky 's , Animal House , etc . If you watch it expecting it to chronicle all of your experiences in your own college life , you will probably either be left wanting more , or mad that they over-dramatize a lot of events . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
I recently got the movie and all I can say it is a good movie . There 's a lot of famous Rome monuments and historical locations.It is from the same writer and director from The Da Vinci Code . Tom Hanks stars along with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer . The movie starts out with the space and time experiment in Sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church 's most hated enemy the Illuminati . The plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything . Its a race all of Rome following the Illuminati trail to get to the Illuminati secret meeting place . While racing against time to find the path of the Illuminati . Over all its a movie worth seeing hell I watched it 3 times and I still like it so in the end go buy it .

" What a gem of a movie , so good that they made a sequel.The film starts off really good with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first set eyes on each other.Bendan Hughes plays the eccentric Vlad , a bit of an inkling there to who this character is , who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house.Hell , we 've all seen vampire movies , we know the format.The movie is watchable , but the actors ' performances are very wooden and they seem as they don 't want to be in this film , but may be that 's just all part of the decadent ambiance.Didn 't like the ending , but there is a sequel , must track it down.When I watched the film I thought Brendan Hughes didn 't really fit the part .

" Like a Circle around the human condition , 2001 starts at the beginning , skips the middle , and proceeds to the ending , right back where we started . Noting the weakness of words compared to image ( s ) , Kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue , preferring the power and essence of the scenery , and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering . Or not , depending on the audience.A monolith in cinematic history , 2001 is a high water mark of direction , execution , and achievement . If one considers the ambition of the film ( a film about everything ) , and the measure of success the film achieved to that end , a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Kim ( Patricia Clarkson ) , George ( Jake Weber ) and son Miles ( Erik Per Sullivan ) are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from Manhattan 's bustling metropolis . On the way , they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow . A group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along . Rather than helping , at least one of the hunters , Otis ( John Speredakos ) , is mad because the accident cracked the buck 's antlers . George , Kim and Miles are disturbed by Otis , and even worse , we quickly learn that Otis has learned where they 're staying . Meanwhile , Miles is given a wendigo ( a kind of Indian shape-shifting spirit / monster ) token by an Indian whom only he has seen . Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes ? Are there wendigos in the woods ? I can see where Wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers . It is a fairly low budget film , with technical limitations frequently showing through . Much of the film , and maybe all of it , is not really about the titular creature . And perhaps the fatal blow for many people , it has a very ambiguous ending , with a number of questions left unanswered . If you are discouraged by such endings , and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant , do yourself a favor and avoid Wendigo.Personally , I like films like that . I usually prefer some ambiguity . The marketing of Wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick , scary creature flick , where they 'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end , and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for Wendigo 2 : The Monster Returns , but that 's not what this film is . Wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people . Heck , writer / director Larry Fessenden even has a character , George , reciting Robert Frost . The Frost poem , and George 's comment that Frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things , is the key to the film.One of the best things about the film is its complexity . In a way , there are four different films occurring at the same time , a thread from each character . In George 's thread , he isn 't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world , and he has some parenting problems . For him , the film is a realistic , horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse . In Patricia 's thread , she 's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family . She 's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her , hoping that they 'll go away and get better . In Otis ' thread , he 's even more down on his luck than George , and George 's arrival into his life symbolizes the final " " crack " " in his psychological armor . And in Miles ' thread , which is probably the most important of the film , life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world . But this is a horror story , after all , albeit one with a glimmer of hope , and the events in the film give Miles ' poetic interpretations a dark turn . Still , when everything is said and done , he seems to be the only one retaining his composure , due to the poetic outlook.Even though the film is low budget , there are a lot of well-executed higher budget ambitions . Fessenden and director of photography Terry Stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations , and created some interesting slide show like montages ( such as the cards , or the Indian wendigo images from the book ) . There are also interesting more traditional montages , such as Miles ' nightmare . Wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films.Other technical aspects are good for the budget . The " " Wendigo " " appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous . The lighting was usually good--there were a few times that dark scenes weren 't as clear as they could have been , but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock ( it could have been digital instead ) or transfer . I thought the performances were good and far more realistic ( if you value that ) than the majority of films . Although I didn 't really notice the score , it must have been okay , or I would have noticed it with a negative judgment.Overall , Wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions , as long as you don 't mind having to think about the movies you watch . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A " " sleeper " . " I had never even heard of this movie until I was channel jumping one night . I 've been a police officer myself for 25 years and thought this was a true to life movie .

" Greetings again from the darkness . Remember all the " " What happened to Woody Allen ? " " jokes ? Even Mr. Allen poked fun at the fans who wanted him to continue making his same " " funny " " films . As with any great artist , Mr. Allen 's craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans , while picking up others . Last year 's masterpiece " " Matchpoint " " showed he is still every bit as relevant and poignant as he was in the days of " " Annie Hall " " and " " Manhattan " . " What is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that Mr. New York himself seems to have a bit of a crush on the mother country . Apparently he actually likes England ! ! While filming " " Matchpoint " , " Mr. Allen became enamored with Scarlett Johansson and her real life spirit and sense of humor . This attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years . Scarlett , while risking overexposure , must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light . She is unafraid to look and act like a real person . In " " Scoop " , " she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and , in many scenes , delivers the real punchline to Mr. Allen 's straight man . Of course , any time Mr. Allen decides to put himself in front of the camera , he will get more than his share of one liners and social commentaries in - which is fine , because few do it better.Very nice support work from Ian McShane and Hugh Jackman . In fact , Mr. Jackman provides a few glimpses into why many of us thought him the best choice to replace Brosnan as the new Bond . As with most of Allen 's films , the star is the script , not the actors . Although Scarlett delivers superbly here and is a nice contrast to the polished Allen and Jackman , what makes this one crackle is the dialogue ... especially the banter between Allen and Scarlett . If you are not a huge Woody the actor fan , fear not . He does limit his screen time and he is quite effective , except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place . Another Woodman tradition is a sparkling musical background and " " Scoop " " is no exception ... especially the Strauss composition . " " Scoop " " is a nice cross between " " Annie Hall " " and the best of the Marx Brothers films or the Cary Grant comedies . Yes it is an adult comedy , but it is actually very cute ... especially for a serial killer and talking ghost comedy ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" An off beat but very delightful performance by John Travolta sets off this very funny comedy . His interpretation of the archangel is as a scuffy , womanizing , overweight , ladies man . And , he certainly has a mesmerizing effect on the women he encounters on his trip to Chicago . John Hurt is very low keyed in his role as chief reporter for Chicago Tabloid owner , Bob Hoskins . Angie MacDowell plays role much as she did her role in " " Four Weddings and a Funeral . " " Maureen Stapleton is neat in a cameo . Her comment , " " Michael doesn 't suffer fools , " " is just one of many memorable moments . Bob Hoskins is the only one of the lead performers who fails to connect , a little to off the wall . Mainly you 're there to see Michael take on a bull , mesmerize the waitresses and lady dancers at a western style restaurant , and fully demonstrate that he is complete free soul . It is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Menagerie parts one and two was the only 2-parter during the 3-year run of the original Trek series and it was because Roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot " " The Cage . " " The move was made out of necessity , to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced ( such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time ) . One positive outcome back then was that audiences , unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier , were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters , as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a TV epic spanning a dozen years of Starfleet history ( though they still used terms such as ' United Space Fleet ' in these early episodes ) .The wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot : the Enterprise is diverted to Starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon Spock is a suspect in these shenanigans . Astonishingly , though even McCoy belabors the fact that Spock 's Vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible , it does turn out that Spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain , Pike , now horribly crippled . Well , Spock is half human , we tend to forget . Or has he simply gone mad ? It may very well be , for he 's directing Enterprise to Talos IV , a planet so off-limits it 's the subject of the only known death penalty on Starfleet 's books . When the jig is up , there 's a great scene of Spock surrendering to a flabbergasted McCoy , as Uhura looks on in shock . Even Kirk , usually steady as a captain should be , doesn 't know what to make of his first officer 's illogical conduct.In the 3rd and final acts , we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the Enterprise from 13 years prior , when Capt. Pike was commanding and Spock was one of his officers . We really don 't know where all this is going and what Spock hopes to accomplish - and that 's another thing that makes this a very good 2-parter - we really need to find out what it 's all about in the 2nd part . Not only is Spock facing severe penalties , but it looks like Kirk 's career may be finished , as well . Double jeopardy , folks . This is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts ( none were available in the earlier " " The Enemy Within " " when the crafts were really needed ) . There 's also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase - this was the only way to visualize such things back then . Finally , check out Kirk 's smug approach at the start of the episode - boy , do things go sideways on him as the story progresses . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The French people are not known to be great movie producers.Though their Amelie scores high points at the Oscars . Asterix et Obelix is a very different film of what I am used to from the French . It is a great movie especially for kids . The only thing that boddert me was that it was spoken in French and subtiteld . Normally with the english spoken movies ( here in the Netherlands ) I don 't have to read the subtitles . But with the French language you just have to read to understand . The story it self is just great with Obelix who doesn 't recall him self of be챦ng fat , but there also nice details mainly in names like brucewillix and malcomix . You all know the story from the comic books and this movie shows all most slide by slide the book .

" Intense , funny , witty , and more than anything , social comedy on the ways of adult dating and it 's results-be it good or bad . Mohr and Nicholson are engaged couple two months away from a wedding date , when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces Nicholson to re-think the relationship and start to date other people so she won 't feel so pristine when it comes to sexual experience . This leads to a disaster of events following Mohr , Nicholson , and their cohorts . Very intelligent and needed in this time of clumsy , condescending comedy , while containing your usual variety of comedic , sexual , and frustrated characters ( especially Charles as a sexually frustrated sex fiend ... very annoying ) who even they seem to get the right feel to this heart felt commentary.The film goes the way films should go these days , showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals . Most of the male characters are the moralistic , straight forward eyes , while the woman are the fresh faced street prowlers who will stop at nothing to get pleasure . Guys will be appreciative of the message made for guys with self respect , however it is easy to assume that most males who DO see this film will use it 's message of male sensitivity cover up any flaw or trait that a female might find offending . Still , the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for it 's male leads , particularly those of Mohr , Richter , and finding the director in a cameo as a sales man ! The females are by far the most promiscuous as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to ... with someone else . They have amicable traits though , even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens . Very funny stuff.On another level , the film follows some of it 's ensemble into different relationship work . Richter meets up with a stressed divorc챕e ( a VERY remarkable and noteworthy performance by the always reliable Helen Slater ) named Penelope who is divorced with a son who hates her for splitting with his father . As the two go deeper into a relationship , human interest is revealed and both the comedy and tragedy of divorce and starting anew are studied . By the end of the film , Mohr and Nicholson have become way to deep over the heads to see what 's coming next , and it is up to what they have learned about each other and themselves to decide what will come next . It becomes appropriate and dramatic at just the right time.Wallodorski 's direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened ... with the right ending.All in all , this film should have been released nationwide , and I should hope that it is up for some Academy Awards ... maybe Helen Slater can finally get the recognition she deserves . Anywho , this film is a no hits miss , give it all you got romantic sex farce , displayed very maturely and aesthetically.Great film ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a pretty OK film ... yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient , and the movie doesn 't really justify the large star cast ( AB , SD , Tanuja ) . However , the actor that really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon ( not to be confused with the singer KK ) . In the scene where he first meets Amitabh 's character , I thought that a man who can just look at AB , keep staring and not say a word , and still look strong , is definitely a good actor . In fact , he has proved himself worthy again in Sarkar , alongside AB for a second time . This guy should get more roles , he 's brilliant.If you 've read any of the other reviews here on IMDb , you already know the plot , and I do agree that Akshaye Khanna 's entry into Pakistan was a little too easy . And the little love angle he shared with " " what 's-her-face " " was completely unnecessary . But he is a fairly good actor ( as seen in DCH ) , Sunjay Dutt is cool to watch , always. and AB ... what can I say . I don 't know if I 'm his biggest fan in the world , but I know I can definitely compete for the spot.An interesting watch , considering it 's Bollywood , although a bit inspired by Hollywood oldies like " " the Great Escape " " and " " Bridge on the River Kwai " .

" My friend took me to a screening of this movie in Hollywood and it was awesome ! It 's a film noir with amazing acting , great script , cool music , the whole thing was very well done and entertaining . Don 't know if it is getting a release in theaters , but this would be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at Blockbuster .

I hope Alexandra Holden gets more big parts like she has in this one , she is fantastic . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As other reviews have stated , there are a few missing videos from this collection , but what is on this disc is overwhelming . There are two separate soundtracks , an original recording and a completely redone new performance version . Any new music from the Residents is welcome , and I suppose for a first time listener , the new version may be more ear-friendly , but I prefer the original recordings ( probably simply because they are " " the originals " . " Production of this DVD is amazing , new and old videos are all interesting , with live performance videos probably the least interesting of what is offered ( although the snippets of live recordings hidden as easter eggs are extremely welcome ) . This is not a renter , this is a must own collection . Enjoy . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I thought this was very " " different " " compared to most modern interpretations of Shakespeare and enjoyed it thoroughly . It would not be useful for those studying it at school etc. as it does not show the traditional Shakespeare character interpretations ( i.e- Miranda is portrayed quite punky compared to your traditional Shakespeare lady ) but for understanding of the play and for the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and fantastic to watch . It does not include also the correct format , as in the layout of acts and scenes as I am currently playing Miranda in a production and most of her lines had been cut and some scenes split and mixed around but it is very useful and I would definitely recommend it as a must-see even if just to say you 've seen it !

" " " Markham , " " says urbane gentleman crime-solver Philo Vance ( William Powell ) to the district attorney , " " I 'm coming more and more to the belief that Archer Coe was killed in this room . That poker , this dagger sheath , now these fragments ... it 's all here . " " " " But Vance , " " Markham says , " " do you mean to tell me a dead man walked upstairs ? " " " " I 'm not trying to tell you anything but the facts , " " Vance says . " " This is the most remarkable case in my experience . " " We 're sympathetic . Wealthy , arrogant Archer Coe , disliked it seems by all who knew him , had been found slumped in a chair in his bedroom , pistol in his hand and a gunshot wound to his head . But wait . Further examination shows Coe had been hit hard by a blunt instrument that fractured his skull . Then there 's the dagger wound in his back . Complicating matters is that Coe 's bedroom door and windows all had been locked from the inside . Coe was no suicide ; this was murder . But how could the killer have escaped ? What was the specific motivation since there are so many suspects ? And why was Coe 's brother , Brisbane Coe , found dead in the main-floor closet ? The Kennel Murder Case , now 73 years old , still provides a stylish look at the old locked- room classic whodunit . What makes it work as well as it does is , first , the mystery is complicated and clever , but still is logical . Second , is the amusing , assured performance of William Powell . Consider his work as Philo Vance as something as a rehearsal for his great performances as Nick Charles . Few things escape Vance . He uses his wits to piece things together . He 's also good company . Powell was a star in the Twenties and moved steadily upward in status and popularity when the talkies took over . His intelligence , style and effortless sophistication have made him one of the most contemporary-seeming of actors from the past . Also pleasant is seeing a few other great faces . There 's Mary Astor as Hilda Lake , the young , resentful and potentially rich ward of Coe ; Paul Cavanaugh as a titled Brit hovering around Hilda ; Helen Vinson with her notably sultry and selfish manner ( watch her really do her stuff in Vogues of 1938 ) ; Etienne Giraudot , a small elderly man as the fussy Dr. Doremus , whose job as coroner and medical examiner keeps taking him away from his meals ; and Ralph Morgan as Archer Coe 's private secretary . This movie has a high percentage of middle-aged men without an ounce of fat who can wear snug , English-cut tailored suits with ease . Most of all is Eugene Palette , with his noble belly and gravel voice , as Detective Sergeant Heath . Sergeant Heath and Vance are long-time acquaintances who actually seem to like each other . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is the best of the films ( so far ) that Christopher Guest has created using his very talented ensemble cast . Previously , they 'd made the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and following BEST IN SHOW , they made the very enjoyable A MIGHTY WIND . As for their latest , FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION , the less said the better.The film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular . You follow these few chosen dogs from pre-show preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious " " Mayflower Kennel Club " . " However , none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world . Amazingly , even though the characters are rather outlandish , there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodying--as decades ago I had some experience with dog shows and this is a VERY cutthroat group of people ! My favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility . I also loved the openly gay couple , as they were terribly funny and clever . However , the best performance probably wasn 't from any of the couples but from Fred Willard who played the world 's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history . His comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed his as an incredibly stupid person--how he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyone 's guess . The other contestants featured were also quite funny--the high-priced professional poodle handler and its rich owner , the country boy and his hound as well as Winkie 's " " parents " " who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the show.Despite the improvised style of film making , the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story--one that is NOT for dog owners only . Exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade . Clever and consistently funny.By the way , try to find this on DVD as the extras were actually worth seeing . While a bit painful to watch , I loved seeing Harlan Pepper and his beach ball collection in particular ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" It has been since 1972 that I saw this movie and I still remember it as one of my favorite all time movies . I would buy a copy if it were on DVD and it is too bad it isn 't . You would think that anything starring Peter Sellers would be brought back . Much better than " " Being There " " and as good as the Pink Panther series . Uschi Digard had a small part for such a well endowed performer . She is bonus in this movie . I think the medical field may not appreciate this film as it really makes fun of the profession and it also makes one appreciate that Sellers was never available to treat them as his bed side manner sucked as well did his analysis of urine samples . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OK , so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers , but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted , right ? Right ! Consider yourselves officially warned , and read on ... In this parody / tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980 's - a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious Murder McGee , who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard . As I 'm sure you can guess , things go from bad to worse faster than you can say " " Where 's the beef ? ? " " and in typical 80 's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody , the dialogue is cheesy , and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get . Good times ... No clique or 80 's horror movie clich챕d characterizations are left unrepresented here . In fact , no stone was left unturned at all 혯 we have the cool hero , his innocent girlfriend , the Goth chick , the tough thug ( think John Bender ) , the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt , the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt , a couple of gorgeous half-naked lesbians , and two big geeks.As you can plainly see , the cast is pretty big . Usually , larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly , with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel . Not in this case though . Not a single cast member left me disappointed . The acting was very well done . Everyone from the cool hero in his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith to the grooovy Goth chick played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One & Two played by Cory Assink & Jonathan Brett 혯 they all played it straight , brought their A-game , and knocked it out of the park . If you 're a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science , you 'll immediately fall in love with the geeks.Director / co-writer Jeff C. Smith is a guy to watch for in the future , trust me on this . If this is what he can do with a low budget , there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects . The characters were dead on ; the atmosphere was perfect ; the laughs were huge ; the blood flowed , and squirted , and sprayed beautifully 혯 it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980 's . Call this one " " THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets NIGHT OF THE DEMONS " " ! ! ! The tag line says it all , and says it honestly - " " EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE ; GRATUITOUS NUDITY ; ZERO BUDGET " " - no false advertising here , folks ! As fans of this genre , we have to look to the indies and support these hard-working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales , lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered-down PG-13 ' horror ' or pointless remakes like The Hitcher . No , thank you - no more of that for me.In closing , I honestly have to say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE ! is by far one of the best indie flicks I 've gotten the pleasure of watching this year . It 's a bloody good time , and holds up on repeat viewings . From the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe ... even the closing love theme over the end credits ( which if that doesn 't bring back fits of laughter recalling mid-80 's power ballads by REO Speedwagon - over-pronounced R 's on every word starting with the letter ' R ' - then I 'll eat my DVD right now ) ... bottom line is , if you 're a fan of 80 's horror or horror in general , no more hesitation - this flick deserves to be in your collection ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was expecting a lot from this movie , and I can say I haven 't been disappointed . First of all , this movie , as a world tour of wine making , let the spectator enjoy beautiful places . The people interviewed are really interesting and funny too , in particular Hubert de Montille . The shooting may be confusing , the camera always being unsteady and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds . You may not like it , but I don 't consider it as a defect.The themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well , since globalization isn 't the only issue discussed . But Nossiter managed to give his movie a consistency all along . A great achievement of this movie is revealing all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are , avoiding a clich챕 " " Good against Evil " . " This could be the main difference between " " Mondovino " " and Michael Moore 's documentaries ; Nossiter 's point of view appears in a subtle way , through opinions expressed by his favorite characters . The richness of this documentary relies mainly upon the characters , the history of long-time wine-making families , such as the De Montilles , the Mondavis , the Antinori and the Frescobaldi . Nossiter lets the spectator discover that wine is somehow related to families , rather than just being a business and an industry . This movie doesn 't make you want to drink wine , but certainly make you want to discover vineyards and wine-makers.I watched this movie as a student in Enology , and let 's just there are many ways to learn . I give this documentary 10 out of 10 , despite his technical particularities . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The film is not for everyone . Some might think the acting is bad when it is actually understated and natural . There are no obviously evil acts and there are no stunningly beautiful moments . There is a lot of indecision , an lot of conflicting feelings.Actually this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject , Sex with minors . It is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and hormones are still developing and both of their minds and personalities are still developing . Complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with minors , and complex , because the characters don 't know if society is right or if their instincts are right.Some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions . Questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship , who was damaged , did good come out of it , was it art , who was damaged more , did some of the problems with their relationship stem from it being forbidden by society , did some of the problems stem from their own immaturity , and probably most important , was this truly a crime ? The film is resolutely neutral on all of this , and it is this neutrality that is its strength . It is the reason for the understated acting , the simple sets , the lack of background music , soft lighting , and the general " " flat " " presentation . The message is clear . We don 't really understand this kind of relationship today , and quick judgments are bound to be shallow . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

THe film is shot in black and white which I was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen . It is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever .

" Reportedy based on actual historical events , this disturbingly violent , bloody , and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era . Ms. Bolkan 's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force . Her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences : her witnessing of the hated local Duke 's casual rapist activity , her forbidden love affair with a Jew , her criminal defection to the invading Moslem forces of the sensual Prince Ahmed ( Anthony Corlan ) There are some painfully realistic gory sequences ( human flaying ) in this film that are not for the squeamish , but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest .

I have loved it since local channels used to show it . Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century . Some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories . ( Many love " " The Fallen Idol " " but I am not among them . I think I saw " " Brighton Rock " " once many years ago and liked it but maybe I 'm simply thinking fondly of the novel . ) This is superbly cast . Charles Boyer does not , it 's true , come across as Spanish . But he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character -- tired , wary , caring . Lauren Bacall is appealing as the British girl who falls for him . But the supporting players are the best : Katina Paxinou is excellent . Her performance is a little Grand Guignol , but I attribute that to the director . Peter Lorre , whom we first meet as he gives Boyer a lesson in an Esperanto-like universal language , is excellent -- as always.And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart . She comes across as a precocious early teenager . The character wants to be helpful . She does her best.I recommend this movie highly . Not without reservations . The reservation is , primarily , that it is a little stolid . But the story and acting can scarcely be bettered . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I am glad other people enjoyed this movie , cause I know it doesn 't have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office . I thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches , the cast ( especially Coleen Camp ) is perfect and the Big Bad Apple never looked better on film .

" I would have to say that in general Barbie Movies have impressed me . I have a 5 year old Barbie fanatic niece and she watches them all the time so needless to say I have seen quite a lot of Barbie these holidays , but I am not sick of them.This film , visually , has a lot to offer , especially the backgrounds , and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie . One thing I noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the animation of Barbie 's hair in this film . It has a lovely range of excerpts from classical music and I think that this is great , as it exposes a new generation to the classics . This film is well worth ago , especially if you have young relievers . They will be entertained for hours ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Darr was a Super Hit film , which was loved by many peoples . It tells the story of Shahrukh Khans innocent obsession for Juhi , who loves Sunny Deol . Honestly it was a entertaining movie , but if you look carefully its not too realistic . Shahrukh Khan keeps phoning Juhi and tells her that he loves her too bits . He gives an announcement in college that he Loves her , and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful photos of her . Unfortunately , instead of being flattered that a guy loves her too bits , she gets very very scared . I personally know 100s of people that get pranked by someone , and these people enjoy it , cos they play a long . Yash Chopra gives us a good film that does entertain , widely because of Shah Rukh Khan 's character . Sunny Deol is suppose to be the main actor , but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan delivering a Superb performance . Shah rukh Khan is literally the villain of the movie , but i would of been happy if he got the girl , because he loves her so dearly . Sunny Deol gives a decent performance , but he beats up all those guys on his own , and survives a brutal knife attack . Juhi Chawla is cute as ever in a fairly good performance . Some good songs including Tu mere samne being the best . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you 're not in the mood for more than an hour long movie than this film could give you some variation . What I love is the ongoing surprises . It 's not only once that you want one or more of the short film in ' New York I Love You ' to be continue . Yeah , some of the short films makes you curious , some of them very short , some of them longer , some of them has it definite ends , some of them don 't.Most of the story presents the sad side of the capital city . It shows many different nationality background . Many of it , make it feels the same way where I have been once went to a capital city in other countries for a year where it has many people came from different countries . This movie explore many type of things you might have known , but for all the characters it 's a new things . Maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new , meet new people ; feel dreamy , sad , but the kind of sad you looking for because it is just that bored you were in your own home . You might want to reliving it again , by watching this . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For a feature film , the plot closely follows history--or at least historical gossip . But then the Chinese , who know the story very well from seeing it portrayed again and again , would never tolerate it otherwise . The attention to detail is wonderful , especially for anyone who has read Sima Qian 's account in the Records of the Historian . Jing Ke , according to Sima Qian , did indeed make an attempt on Qin Shi Huang 's life at the request of the Crown Prince of Yan before unification . Sima Qian explicitly mentions both the head of General Fan and the dagger rolled up into the map , as well as the dagger being thrown into the brass column . Although Jing Ke is described as no stranger to swordplay , he 's hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by Chen Kaige . Jing Ke is indeed this film 's weakest link . In reality ( again , according to Sima Qian ) , he was a heavy drinker and put off his visit to Qin for as long as possible , spending a good deal of time with the ladies of Yan before the crown prince finally ordered him on his way . He was , in short , a human being and was not looking forward to death although he was willing to accept it . Chen Kaige 's Jing Ke is afraid of death , but not his own . He is the classic ruthless killer turned disillusioned pacifist . His love ( or maybe just affection ) for a woman and pity for several hundred children whom Zheng had buried alive ( not even two thousand years of hostile Confucian historians claimed Qin Shi Huang did this , although there is a legend about him burying 460 Confucians up to their necks and then beheading them ) is enough to make this former assassin kill again . The melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being just plain boring . The acting here isn 't shabby , though not very interesting given the character . As for Lady Zhou , in all the numerous stories I 've heard about Qin Shi Huang , she 's never come up . Anyway , Gong Li is famous enough for Americans to have heard of her ( thanks to Zhang Yimou ) and there needed to be a love interest , so here she is . It 's unfortunate that her performance is almost as wooden as Jing Ke 's character . She 's done much better ( in Qiu Ju for example ) at being subtle ; here she just barely manages presence . But all of this is trivial compared to the extraordinary acting of Li Xuejian as Zheng himself . Qin Shi Huang is for the Chinese rather what Milton 's Satan is for us : accepted as a villain , but a noble one . Qin Shi Huang 's accomplishments radiate an awe all the way across two thousand years into the present and Li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity . Li 's performance is enough , but the scope of the film is grand although the photography is purposely drab . It does feel ancient . The score is adequate , scarcely moving though very appropriate to the action . Though I 've only seen it once , I believe that Chen Kaige should be given more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed him . The opening credits are exhilarating . If five stars its absolutely average , I given three more for Li Xuejian 's acting and Chen Kaige as an actor , writer , and director . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Retro Puppet Master starts in Kolewige during 1944 where puppet master Andre Toulon ( Guy Rolfe ) & his living puppets plan to escape Germany , hold up in an Inn puppet master Toulon reminisces about his early life & the point at which he learned the secret of giving life to dead objects way back in 1902 in Paris when his younger self ( Greg Sestero ) ran the Theate Magique . He describes the fateful night when he met a 3000 year old Egyptian sorcerer named Afzel ( Jack Donner ) & the eventual love of hi life the young & beautiful Ilsa ( Brigitta Dau ) . He tells the story of how Afzel passed the gift of life to himself & gave life to his own wooden puppets that were part of the Theatre Magique show . However the gift of life was also a curse as the ancient God Sutek whom the secret was stolen from in the first place by Afzel wants it back & everyone who has learnt it dead ... As of late I have been on a bit of a Puppet Master bender as being a big fan of the first three I decided to watch the rest of the franchise & as such I have seen Puppet Master 4 ( 1993 ) , Puppet Master 5 : The Final Chapter ( 1994 ) , Curse of the Puppet Master ( 1998 ) & now Retro Puppet Master in the space of a couple of weeks & boy was it tough to get through them all , especially this one as it 's the worse of the series so far . Retro Puppet Master feels like a cross between Puppet Master III : Toulon 's Revenge ( 1991 ) with it 's period setting & Puppet Master 4 & Puppet Master 5 : The Final Chapter with Sutek trying to kill everyone associated with his stolen life giving secret . There 's not much continuity here either , again there 's none of the green serum featured in the earlier films & despite Andre Toulon committing suicide in 1939 at the start of the original Puppetmaster ( 1989 ) he is seen alive & well during 1944 in this . The majority of the story is told as a flashback & concentrates on Andre Toulon himself rather than the puppets , the film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa & him learning the secret of life & it 's all rather dull & tedious stuff to be honest . Even at only 80 odd minutes Retro Puppet Master feels long & padded with no real pace & the no central concept as the plot never really settles down & generally hops around a lot . Then of course there 's the baffling decision to totally redesign the puppets which I found incredible , I mean why would the makers take the one basic thing that made the Puppet Master films so memorable & completely do away with it ? The puppets are seen briefly at the start & the end but otherwise we get these rubbishy looking wooden caricatures that are nowhere near as cool as their modern re-workings . It 's never even explained why these puppets were used rather than the ones all Puppet Master fans have come to love although one suspects that Full Moon was hoping to make yet another sequel which dealt with that very question.If a poor story & a complete lack of our favourite puppets wasn 't bad enough Full Moon decided to go with a PG-13 rating for this making Retro Puppet Master the only Puppet Master film not rated ' R ' in the US ( obviously other countries have their own film ratings systems ) & therefore there 's not a single drop of blood in the entire film , the puppets don 't kill anyone , there 's no swearing & no nudity either . This is tamer than tame kids stuff all the way . Besides the puppets themselves being rubbish the special effect are the wost of the series too , there 's no stop motion animation at all in this one , no CGI computer effects ( surely in 1999 CGI was cheap enough ? ) & all the effects are of the stiff rod puppet type effects . I mean whenever you see a puppet ' walk ' the camera is always positioned above it 's wait so it 's legs don 't have to be shown & there 's obviously some production assistant just pushing the thing along , that 's as complex & state of the art as the special effects get.The one positive thing that Retro Puppet Master does have going for it is that it looks rather nice , the period production design , costumes & props are actually quite impressive & it 's a fairly handsome film to watch at times . Apparently filmed in Bucharest in Romania which doubles up quite nicely for turn of the last century Paris . The acting here is awful & maybe the worst of the series.Retro Puppet Master is more or less the final Puppet Master film as the next one Puppet Master : The Legacy ( 2004 ) basically edits together footage from the previous seven films & it 's a pretty crappy way to round the series off which started so well with three excellent & distinctive little killer puppet flicks . Don 't bother with this , just watch one of the first three again & just remember the good times ... The killer puppets would return in the terrible spin-off flick Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys ( 2004 ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I haven 't seen much German comedy , but if this film is anything to go by , I 'm compelled to see more ! The simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva , an unemployed mother of two , discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer . I won 't reveal anything further , but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion . My interest in international cinema has expanded since I first saw this film .

" Ok , let 's get this out of the way first : As a piece of cinema , Lifeforce is rubbish . As a bit of cheesy entertainment for SF buffs , it 's got a lot of merit . If you enjoy watching those old black and white SF B-movies - giant mutated spiders / ant or alien monsters wandering around the desert - you really will get a kick out of Lifeforce.Bad things : The story makes little sense and the acting is pretty poor . Good things : The special effects are halfway decent ; it has a welcomingly different British centered story ( it 's set in London ) which gives different feel to most SF movies ; and it has the well-endowed Mathilda May ( amusingly billed as " " Space Girl " " ) wandering around stark naked . In short : it 's fun . I 've seen it half a dozen times now , and every time it comes on TV I make time to watch it - admittedly this is partly to do with the naked Ms. May - but it 's also to do with the enjoying a bit of unassuming and silly SF . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Robert Siodmak does a fabulous job with this B noir starring Ella Raines , Franchot Tone , and Alan Curtis . And he does it , I might add , without a lot of help from his male actors , i.e. , Curtis and Tone . It 's Raines all the way , a pretty , leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her " " noir " " counterparts.Siodmak 's use of sex , light , shadows , and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre . The shadows , lighting effects , and camera angles are all effective . But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by Elisha Cook , egged on by an excited Raines . It 's this scene that brings " " Phantom Lady " " into new territory.Siodmak 's commitment to the material is matched only by Raines , who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man . Franchot Tone phoned this one in . Alan Curtis didn 't seem upset that he might die and didn 't seem happy that he lived . And he never , except for a brief moment in prison , seemed to be in love with Raines.The amusing thing about many of these films is that , as World War II progressed , interest in psychiatry deepened . But often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as " " Possessed , " " " " Spellbound , " " and " " The Greatest Show on Earth . " " Tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder , but he appears to be closer to a psychopath . In actuality , as evidenced by his headaches , he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain.Phantom Lady doesn 't have the greatest plot , but it 's well worth watching . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was , reflecting the apathy of adolescents ( this was before Generation " " X " " ) .In a way , most of us are products of the same consumer culture ; these high school kids spend their time drinking , getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a riverbank.What would they do today ? Would things be different ? . Some very important questions . There are some excellent scenes with Keanu Reeves , and the dysfunctional family he lives with ; his 11 year old brother going out to get wasted ; the mother has no idea what to do- spends her time drinking with her boyfriend.This film was a bit before its time in that it addresses the problems in lower class American society ; these kids had no outlet ; what is available for them in this dirt-water town ? . All in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented , and there are no solutions . 9 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" SPOILERSTom and Jerry is a classic cartoon , with a flawless idea , and almost every single short is a gem . While I must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic Tom and Jerry shorts , there is not way you can hate this cartoon . Sure , it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first Tom and Jerry episodes , and I can say that I agree , but the fact of the matter is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great , but some are just better than others . Well , this would fit into " " others . " " Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat . Tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast , and becomes easily frightened . Jerry observes how scared he is , and tries to scare him even more than he already is . He creates scary dilemmas for Tom , and Tom becomes scared out of his wits , and his lives . Jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it , thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost . Tom finds out that Jerry did all of this , and chases him . Tom then accidentally bites the house maid . However , at the end Jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup.Overall , this is far from the best Tom and Jerry short out there , but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time . It makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this . The slapstick and gags in this that make Tom and Jerry famous are as good as ever in this short , but it felt like something was missing in this . It felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts . Anyway , this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other Tom and Jerry cartoons , but it is still nice.7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski . He is Polish , I am Dutch , yet we share a synthetic mind : the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence . Hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister , so that as a social and cultural ' low pressure area ' , Poland could play the role it did in WWII , being critical yet Christian towards the Jews but often not less critical toward oneself . There are innocence and guilt in Kieslowski 's world view , as the symbols in Catholicism : the White versus the Black Madonna . In Rouge , the Black Madonna is she who the judge fell in love with when he was a young man . Flashbacks are magically-realistically intertwined with the present , although totally coincidental , such as the camera simply swinging to the other side of the street or the then young judge 's red jeep passing by the now young woman 's car after she accidentally hit his dog with it . That we leaped through time in those same camera moves , is what we grasp later . His love was unanswered , so that his life wasn 't as he had planned it . He lost his ability to love other people and animals . Being a judge , he feels he is actually spying on other peoples ' lives and when he retires , he simply continues to do so , spying on his neighbors this time . The innocence and sense of righteousness of the younger woman ( literally ) accidentally getting into his life , reinstalls his better judgment and it is because of her that he spontaneously confesses his spying behavior to his neighbors and the police , accepting and even holding on to the stones consequentially thrown through his windows . In the process , history repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves , although this time he is old and the woman not the same . Kieslowski may have wrestled with this bit for the old judge is his alter ego , and it is said he was infatuated by Ir챔ne Jacob . Both women play the same essential role in his psychology , of the one ( ! ) who possesses his heart and soul and therefore can make him or break him , even as an old man ! It is as if the ' powers in the air ' are , or God is , bringing them together . Coincidences are * too * coincidental to just be chance or even good luck . There has to be some mystical , supernatural or theological source influencing these unfathomably deep life-decisions . The study book fell and opened at the page of the exam question is another example of this . Or the moment the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman , the wind outside the opera house suddenly slams the open doors and breaks the windows . The gigantic picture of the young woman happens to predict the one on TV , after the drowning accident on her Canal crossing trip . These moments are effectively accentuated through the human voice of liturgy or what sounds like it ( Van den Budenmayer ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I don 't know why some guys from US , Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they don 't understand at all . For those who did not watch this movie - watch it . Don 't expect too much or don 't put some frameworks just because this is Kosturica . Watch the movie without prejudice , try to understand the whole humor inside - people of Serbia DID actually getting married while Bil Clinton bomb their villages , gypsies in all Balkans are ALWAYS try to f * ck you up in any way they can , LOVE is always unexpected , pure and colorful , and Balkans are extremely creative . For those who claims this is a bad movie I can see only that the American 's sh * t ( like Meet Dave , Get Smart etc ) are much much worse than a pure , frank Balkan humoristic love story movie as Promise me . The comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer . I think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside . It is simple , but true . It is brutal , but gentle and makes you laugh to dead . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Being a seasoned fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento , Mario Bava , Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado , I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack . I had seen The Beyond which I think is totally overrated , I found The New York Ripper to be simply appalling and I didn 't particularly like The House By the Cemetery . These three movies left me to conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers . But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to check out more of his films . City of the Living Dead was a film I found very interesting but Don 't Torture a Duckling is very nearly a masterpiece.Set in a small town in the Italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are being murdered . The authorities are clueless as to who 's behind these crimes , especially after their prime suspect has been cleared . An eager young reporter along with a rather slutty girl ( who seduces young boys ) investigate and eventually get to the bottom of it.Brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast ( not always the case with 70 's Italian thrillers ) make Don 't Torture a Duckling a crackling good thriller . The plot is well constructed , not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying . Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals , particularly in a scene where a woman gets beaten to death by some local townsfolk . Fulci 's social commentary concerning religion and innocence are quite edgy and every aspect is well handled . When thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo New York Ripper it 's amazing how well he balances his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point . So far I haven 't seen any Fulci film made as professionally as this one.While not a traditional giallo film , Duckling has many of the genre 's trademarks . Fulci displays complete control over the format , only once going overboard with an unconvincing gore-moment , but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics . The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a punch.So far Don 't Torture a Duckling is Fulci 's best film by far in my opinion . Edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to boot . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a movie that deserves another look--if you haven 't seen it for a while , or a first look--if you were too young when it came out ( 1983 ) . Based on a play by the same name , it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring Shakespearean repertory company in England during World War II . It deals with his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young , able bodied ones being taken for military service . It also deals with his relationship with various members of his company , especially with his dresser . So far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth . While tragic overall , the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout . The two male leads both received Oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so . I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama , theater--especially Shakespeare , or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity . The backstage goings-on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As with all of Angelopoulos ' films , " " The Suspended Step of the Stork " " implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer , a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work . Dialogues are sparing , with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters ' inner conflicts , doubts , or feelings . The filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses , and instead forces them to explore and study the characters ' identities for themselves . As a result , the acting is understated and implicit , as opposed to overt and explicit.The action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation , where the viewer is asked to become a participant , to participate as an actor , by probing his or her own psyche . As in a novel , where the drama rests entirely on the author 's writing to provide a template where the reader 's imagination and / or past experience flourish , Angelopoulos ' drama rests within his images : his uses of the long shots , the long takes , the leisurely pacing , the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark , inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective . Angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity , reverting to the non-verbal language of gestures , gazes , sounds , and music , when he believes that words can only take us so far.The music , by Angelopoulos ' long time collaborator , Eleni Karaindrou , provides more than just a discreet background , but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story . A large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle , subdued colors , recorded in a drab winter light . Angelopoulos presents us with an " " other Greece , " " one far different from the Greece of the tourist brochures , with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas , drowned in an eternal sunshine . Here , the skies are covered and gray , the air is cold and misty , and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled , dirty snow of the village streets . Angelopoulos ' genius through Arvanitis ' camera is on display throughout the film . " " The Suspended Step of the Stork " " is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio-political situation in the Balkans at the end of the twentieth century . It is deeply concerned with the meaning of " " borders , " " and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations . In the " " waiting room " " facing the Albanian border , the refugees , political or other , outcast by the rest of humanity , wait . They may be stuck against a political border , but unfortunately they still carry with them , and hang on , deeper ancestral borders : those of the languages , of the customs , and of the races . Although Angelopoulos ' political views are well known , the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees ' plights . In the process , Angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical , cultural , political , and personal " " borders . " " Angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century Greece , and he likes to bring lessons from the Hellenic myths into his discussions . In this film , he does some border crossing himself between the Greek and Italian cultures , drawing from a combined Homeric and Dantesque tradition of Odysseus ' travel . Alexander is a Telemachus , in search of a story about an aging Greek politician / Odysseus who disappeared , never to be heard of again . This political man , a brilliant orator , unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence , his wife , and his brilliant career , to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low . He became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world . Of course , the " " politician " " is not Alexander 's father , but the " " politician " " stands before Alexander like a father figure / Odysseus . As with Homer 's Telemachus , Alexander grows as a person during his odyssey.Of course , it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of Homer 's Odyssey in a contemporary context . Angelopoulos draws on Odysseus 's travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film . In Angelopoulos ' ending , " " Odysseus " " is more like the Dante 's Odysseus : he does not leave for Ithaca but goes on , " " carrying a suitcase . " " And Alexander / Telemachus is " " suspended " " between returning to his home and his career , or embarking on a voyage to " " somewhere else . " " He states as much , in a voice-over at the beginning of the film , paraphrasing few lines from Dante 's " " Inferno " " : " " And don 't forget that the time for a voyage has come again . The wind blows your eyes far away . " " Finally , although Angelopoulos is not a religious person , there is a Greek Orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow-suited linesmen , who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications , and also the Christ-like figure of the " " politician . " " In the final scene , these men in yellow demonstrate once more the Byzantine iconography 's influence in Angelopoulos ' work . They appear like " " stylites , " " religious figures found in the Orthodox tradition , solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars , in a form of asceticism.The film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by Mastroianni . Angelopoulos does not give us any clues , and the wife 's statement , " " It 's not him , " " is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough . The important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician , but that he could be the politician . But the film still ends on an optimistic note . Whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river , and thus communications across the border are still not possible , and it remains impenetrable , we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river : the camera has crossed the border , and the reverse tracking shot is inviting Alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary . On this account , Angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow , some of the borders will eventually crumble . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Iron Eagle may not be the most believable film plot-wise , but the characters are well written and very well acted . If you cannot believe the characters , the film is a flop.I believe the photography , especially the aerial photography is superb . I believe it is far superior to Top Gun to which it is endlessly compared . It is one of the best pieces of aerial photography I have seen . The soundtrack by Basil Paledouros ( forgive the spelling ) is great , and juxtaposes well with the rock tunes . I wish that portion of the soundtrack were available.Jason Gedrick does well as the teenager who suddenly has to grow up in a rush and and the realities of life , death , and responsibilities . Lou Gossett is fab as Chappy , both hard-bitten and yet human as he recalls pilot deaths.There are lots of movies out there that you watch once and don 't care to watch again . Then there are those movies that get you for one aspect or another and you can watch it again and again ! Iron Eagle is that kind of movie ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I LOVE this movie . Director Michael Powell once stated that this was his favorite movie , and it is mine as well . Powell and Pressburger created a seemingly simple , superbly crafted story - the power of love against " " the powers that be " . " However , its deception lies in the complexity of its " " is it real or is it imaginary " " premise . Basically , one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young , poetically inclined airman during WWII . Or is it ? The question is never answered one way or the other . Actually , it is never even asked . This continuous understatement is part of the film 's appeal.The innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers . For instance , Pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of Richard Strauss ' opera , Der Rosenkavalier , about a young 18th century Viennese aristocrat . This is evident in the brief interlude in which Conductor 71 , dressed in all his finery , holds the rose ( which appears silver in heaven ) . The music even has a dreamy quality.All of the acting is first rate - David Niven is at his most charming , and he has excellent support from veteran Roger Livesey and relative newcomer Kim Hunter . But , in my opinion , the film 's charm comes from Marius Goring as Conductor 71 . He by far has the most interesting role , filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness , brightening the film . It 's a pity that some of Conductor 71 's scenes were left on the cutting room floor . It is also a pity that Goring 's comedic talents are rarely seen again on film , except in the wonderful videos of The Scarlet Pimpernel television series from the 1950s . This is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career . He is a perfect foil for relaxed style of Niven , and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters . Ironically , also in the mid -1940s , Niven also starred against another heavenly " " messenger " , " played by Cary Grant , in The Bishop 's Wife . Their acting styles were so similar that I found the result boring , unenergetic , and disappointing . As a note , according to Powell , Goring desperately wanted the role of Peter Carter , initially refusing Conductor 71 . It 's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal.The movie , " " commissioned " " to smooth over the strained relations between Britain and the U.S. , overdrives its point towards the end . But it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war - the numerous casualties , both military and civilian , the need to " " go on " " when faced with death . There is a conspicuous lack of WWII " " enemies " " in heaven , but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin . Powell and Pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasn 't necessary . The movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for , but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the Atlantic . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" 24 has got to be the best spy / adventure series TV had ever aired . The whole idea of telling a story in a 24 hour real time period is dazzling . The style of filming and pacing is what hooks us to watch it . And Jack Bauer is one of the greatest protagonists in a TV series in a long time . I rate this , along with The Simpsons and The X-Files , my three most favorite TV series.This first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate US Senator David Palmer who is also running for president . Bauer is called to his office in order to discover who is behind all this and , at the same time , figure his daughter 's path to the unkwown after fleeing from her bedroom . Thus , begins an adventure on the best political style and , what 's best of it , is that it always takes place in real time , which makes this TV series a real work of originality in a time where almost every program on TV seems to be showing us the same things over and over and over . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across . It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody . The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie . Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background ; rather like the system in MASH . The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years . Oh ... and the " " Busty Nurse " " is Cassandra Peterson , who went on to become Elvira , Mistress of the Dark . If you liked the Mel Brooks classic movies ( Blazing Saddles , etc . ) , I suspect you 'd like this one.Damn shame you can 't get it on DVD anywhere.It 's available on DVD now ! ! ! ! !

" A hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first time writer / director Peter M. Cohen . The story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to confer about their dating woes . We meet Brad : a good-looking , wall-street playboy with a quick-wit and sharp tongue ; Zeek : a cynical , sensitive writer ; Jonathan : a sexually perplexed nice guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation ; and Eric : the married guy , who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence . The trials and tribulations of the men 's single lives in New York are amusingly expressed , mirroring that of Sex in the City and HBO 's new comedy The Mind of Married Man , and bring an astute light to scamming . The story takes a twist as the three singletons meet Mia--wittily played by Amanda Peet-and all fall for her . She seduces them each with her uncanny ability to conform to the personalities ' they exhibit . When they come to realize they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman , they chose her over their friendship . Whipped is a realistic portrayal of the dating world , one that the critic 's failed to recognize . In plain language , they missed the point . The protagonist 's here are caricatures of real people . The exaggerations are hysterical , mixing satire and humility , and are not to be taken as seriously as the critic 's disparagement suggests . See this movie , you 'll laugh from start to finish . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ok the film wasn 't going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum , and it is a modern update on " " It 's a wonderful life " .

You get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming B list celebs .

" This could be the most underrated movie of its genre . I don 't remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didn 't do so well at the box office . However , Frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie . I rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list.Movie begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself " " God 's hand " . " And then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother . Two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case . During that trip , the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began . Fenton and Adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who , one day , claims that he has received a divine message from God asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings . He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission.This is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat . The tension runs high , innocent people ( or demons ? ) get killed and religious experiences are questioned . It has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end . If you like this genre , I highly recommend Frailty for you . I own the DVD and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thrillers . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Why were there so many people crowding into an evening showing of Roberto Moreira 's " " Up Against Them All " " ( " " Contra Todos " " ) at the San Francisco Film Festival ? " " It 's about a hit man , " " my friend said . " " Well . . . and it 's Brazilian , " " I added . Beautiful multicolored people , tropical weather , lush rhythms , and a hip gangster plot ? Ample enticements no doubt.Somebody forgot to tell us one little detail : this is a very bad movie , really pretty horrible , and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly made.So how on earth did " " Contra Todos " " get to make the rounds of Berlin , Melbourne , London , Manila , Stockholm , Cairo , Chicago , numerous smaller local festivals , and now San Francisco ? Apparently , because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work.First of all , it won first prize at the Rio Film Festival where it was called the best Brazilian movie of the year . It must have been a bad year ; they 've had much , much better ones . Next , snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and -- since the movie isn 't featured anywhere and so avoids close scrutiny by critics -- it keeps going the rounds.Festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot . A Chicago Festival one called " " Contra Todos " " " " a speedball cocktail shot straight out of Brazil " " and referred to Claudia 's s boyfriend as the " " stud of the slum-like neighborhood . " " Soninha is " " Teodoro 's nymph-like teen-aged daughter of burgeoning sexuality . " " The movie is " " shot with the urgency of a frequently hand-held camera " " and the director " " works up a genuine and palpable sense of frustration borne from domestic desperation and decay . " " The effect is " " unbearably raw and honest , " " and the movie hurtles " " toward a conclusion as dead-ended as the lives on display . " " Not the best writing , but it sure pumps up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewer . " " Contra Todos " " does concern a hit man , two hit men actually , and a wife and daughter and a born-again Christian girlfriend . It 's shot -- in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera-work -- mostly in a barren-looking poor suburb rather than in one of the teeming " " favelas " " or village-like Brazilian city slums where such wonderful films as " " Black Orpheus " , " " " Pixote , " " and " " City of God " " were made , and not in Rio this time , but S찾o Paulo.The hit man with family problems is Teodoro ( Giulio Lopez ) and his partner with a drug problem is Waldomiro ( Ailtan Gra챌a ) . Both actors have a little TV experience as does the actress who plays Teodoro 's sluttish blonde wife Cl찼udia ( Leona Cavalli ) and Silvia Loren챌o who plays his pouting , ready-to-revolt daughter Soninha . These actors might make it through the back corners of a few telenovelas . Who knows ? -- in a better directed film they might even be good . Aside from them there are some young men who get bumped off by Teordoro or , when he 's busy , gangs of thugs . The principals don 't work up much presence , even though the camera magnifies their pores.A couple of observers , one at the Berlin Festival and one at London 's , did see this movie 's failings but alas they 're buried in the Web hinterlands . Henry Sheehan noted from Berlin that the " " film " " ( his quotes ) was " " the worst of the video works " " shown . " " The filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film , " " Sheehan wrote , " " and hasn 't made any creative use of the new medium " " -- nor , he adds , done anything else creative.Sheehan pointed out the movie 's first big mistake : it " " starts off as a domestic drama that 's supposed to ratchet up when , half an hour into the action , Moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men . Waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie ; it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is , at the very least , a waste of time . But ratcheting up is all Moreira ever does , like a little kid who 's gotten a tool kit for his birthday , and goes around banging everything in sight without rhyme , reason or skill . " " Devastating , but true.Writing about the 2004 London festival for Kamera.com , Metin Alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances " " easily the film 's best feature . " " Yes , very easily , given that everything else is so bad . Alsanjak admitted that " " this low-budget , violent and seedy account of the lawless in Sao Paulo is devoid of any likable characters , and as a result , of hope . Too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition , the film is not helped by poor subtitling .. . " " Alsanjak 's connecting Contra Todos to " " Dogme " " and Mike Leigh didn 't help matters.Apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence -- which , when they come , are just " " banging everything in sight without rhyme , reason or skill " " -- Moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it , followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married . No doubt the director wanted to exhibit the " " banality of evil " " of low-level hit men in working class neighborhoods , but he can 't make the characters , which he sees generically , come alive for us . And the structure of the film shows that he also can 't edit his material . ( Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28 , 2005 . ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ladies and gentlemen , we 've really got ourselves a winner here . Actually we don 't , but boy is this film an often hilarious and always entertaining horrible hoot of a stinker . Poor Alma ( fetching Julia Ruiz ) is suffering from an ancient Mayan curse that causes lethal poisonous snakes to grow inside of her body . Alma and her deranged shaman husband Brujo ( Alby Castro , who feverishly overacts with delicious eye-rolling intensity ) stowaway on a train that 's bound for Los Angeles . Naturally , a bunch of deadly vipers get lose so they can terrorize the motley assortment of passengers . The Mallachi Brothers , working from an absurd script by Eric Fosberg , treat the ridiculous premise straight , thereby creating a wonderfully wretched piece of deliriously campy cheese . The cruddy CGI effects , the pathetically unfrightening common variety Gardner snakes ( there 's would-be scary rattlesnake noises added to the soundtrack to imbue them with a faint sense of otherwise nonexistent menace ) , the plodding pace , the total dearth of any tension or momentum , the obvious rickety stage-bound train set , and especially the simply astonishing " " you gotta be kiddin ' me ! " " over-the-top preposterous ending are all downright awesome in their very jaw-dropping awfulness . Better still , we also got game ( if lame ) acting from a no-name cast , a nice smidgen of tasty gratuitous female nudity , a funky hum 'n'shiver score , and plenty of extremely gross and grotesque make-up f / x .

" Not one of your harder-hitting stories , and that 's a real strength of this film . There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension . They not only spare the audience this , but throw in some surprises at the same time . There are a few Disney-ish moments , particularly near the end , but they are manageable . Overall , it was worth the rental and it was good , relaxed fun.BTW , if you get the DVD , watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi .

Next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it , because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've always enjoyed animated ducks for some reason : Duck Tales , Darkwing Duck , Daffy Duck , Donald Duck . Though none of them are as deranged as Duckman . Originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997 Duckman lasted for a total 70 episodes but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stale.The titular character is a discombobulated , unapologetic slob and pretty much the worst living person in the world . He 's a private detective , a widower , a peeping tom , an alcoholic , a sex maniac , a murderer , a ( fill in the blank ) . You name it , Duckman has done it . But who can blame him for being such a slimeball when the world he / we live in is so insane , outrageous and just plain nonsensical ? Eric Tiberius Duckman ( voiced by the maniacal Jason Alexander ) could carry the whole show by himself but when he 's surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity . My favorite has to be Willibald Feivel Cornfed ( or just Cornfed Pig ) , Duckman 's incredibly deadpan sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly skilled at everything and is perpetually oblivious to his partner 's infinity of vices and incompetence.The typical plot will involve some bizarre case he 'll inevitably blunder through or will revolve around his highly dysfunctional household , though every now and again Duckman 's arch-enemy King Chicken ( Tim Curry ) , a sort of Professor Moriarty in fowl form , hatches some diabolical scheme in revenge for being bullied in high school.Since I was a teenager this has been my absolute favorite animated show , better than The Simpsons , Family Guy and even King of the Hill . Nothing will ever surpass it . There never was , or will be , anything quite like Duckman ever again . The level of satire , observational humor and writing is so sharp it 's deadly and the animation is done in that unique Klasky / Csupo style ( anyone who has seen Rugrats will understand ) . It 's a wonderful , highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish , 1940s feel.You can never have too much of this particular bird . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are terrific . I have seen Kilmer on The Doors , however his interpretation of John Holmes is superb . Nothing compared to Boogie Nights which was kind of slow . Wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around . At the same time , the John Holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed . The movie deserves being watched more than once . The seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film was a wonderful romp , intelligent , playful , mysterious , full of surprises , with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy . The famous film director ( the protagonist ) and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating ways as he is nearly out-maneuvered by a prince who has never heard of him . There are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed ( exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director ? ) . The ending is so much the better for being untidy . Realism and logic are not what you should be looking for here . If we are going to turn our weddings and our imaginative lives over to film directors , we should be prepared for a wild ride , this film seems to suggest . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" It is not an easy film to watch - it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations . Yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character , that it is , in my humble opinion , one of the very greatest films of all time.The film is depressing , cynical and cruel . ( If you want something uplifting , see Jacques Rivette 's fantastic C챕line and Julie Go Boating , which was made around the same time ) . It shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change.It involves a supposedly liberated m챕nage-횪-trois between Alexandre ( played by Jean-Pierre Leaud ) , Marie ( Bernadette Lafont ) and Veronika ( Francoise Lebrun ) . Yet Alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man . The women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze.The film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary French New Wave . This movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it . Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key actors of the New Wave , having starred ( among other films ) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups ( 1959 ) by Francois Truffaut as a rebellious teenager . Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other directors from the New Wave , but he should be.There is no improvisation ( unlike in John Cassavetes 's similar films made in the US ) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations . The film is resonant with Eustache 's personal experiences . For example , Francoise Lebrun was a former lover of Eustache . Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character Marie was based on , did too . The anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by Veronika delivered directly to the audience , breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film . This mesmerising , personal , and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well , it definitely is unlike anything else directed by Lynch . No supernatural stuff , no violence , no profanity . Nevertheless , it is a beautiful flick . It 's a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because it 's the story of an old man 's 6-week ( that 's my best guess for its duration ) journey . The characters are everyday people and thus , they are believable . The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching . Everyone who has a sibling can relate to it . Lyle and Alvin don 't even have to say anything . For a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in Canada ( still only in limited release ) . It was worth the wait and then some . I am a very avid reader of Margaret Laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film . I actually ended up liking the movie better than the novel . I liked that the character of Bram Shipley was a bit less harsh , and that there seemed to be more of a love story between Hagar and Bram , which made the scenes at the end of Bram 's life that much more moving . The loss seemed stronger . Hagar was not any more likable on film than in the book , but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role . She WAS Hagar through and through . Christine Horne was brilliant and has many more great things ahead I am sure . Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying . I could go on and on , overall a 9 * out of 10 .

" On Sunday July 27 , 1997 , the first episode of a new science fiction series called " " Stargate SG-1 " " was broadcast on Showtime . A spin-off of and sequel to the 1994 film " " Stargate " " starring Kurt Russell and James Spader , the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film . For ten seasons , it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as SG-1 . Originally , the series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O 'Neill ( two " " l " " s ! ) , Michael Shanks as Dr. Daniel Jackson , Amanda Tapping as Captain Samantha Carter , Christopher Judge as Teal 'c and Don S. Davis as Major General George S. Hammond . For ten long years , we watched the team battle against the Goa 'uld , the Replicators , the Ori and many other aggressors . At the same time , they forged alliances with the Asgard , the Tok 'ra , the rebel Jaffa , the Nox and the Tollan . They saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up , not until death claimed them . And sometimes not even then.As with all long-running series , they were numerous cast changes . Michael Shanks left the series in January 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor . Daniel Jackson 's successor as the team 's resident archaeologist / geek was Jonas Quinn , an alien from a country called Kelowna on the planet Langara , played by Corin Nemec . However , Shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in June 2003 and Nemec left at the same time . Unfortunately , he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards . Don S. Davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in March 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go . The show 's original star and arguably its most popular actor , Richard Dean Anderson , starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons . His participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons . He finally left " " SG-1 " " in March 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six-year-old daughter . Jack O 'Neill was by far my favourite character in the series and , truth be told , I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reason.The ninth season represented a new era for the programme . With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goa 'uld and the Replicators in Season Eight , many fans felt the series should go out on a high . Regardless , the series carried on for a further two years with the Ori replacing the Goa 'uld as the series ' main adversaries . Three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re-invention . Ben Browder came in as the cocky Southern Air Force pilot Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell , the new leader of SG-1 . His " " Farscape " " co-star , the lovely Claudia Black , began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious , sexy , hilarious and certainly extroverted Vala Mal Doran , a former Goa 'uld host and con artist from another planet . A recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons , she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season . Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry , the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack O 'Neill and General Hammond . For the last two years , they starred alongside the " " SG-1 " " faithful ( Michael Shanks , Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge ) and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the Stargate franchise.Alas , all good things must come to an end . During the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of Season Ten , ratings dropped considerably , resulting in cancellation in its August 2006 . After ten seasons and 214 episodes , the dream was finally over . On March 13 , 2007 , what began with " " Children of the Gods " " ended with " " Unending " . " The series finale made its world premiere on Sky One in Britain and Ireland before being shown on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States on June 22 , 2007.In the ten years that the series was on the air , it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series , " " Star Trek " , " in terms of popularity in certain countries . It became the second-longest running sci-fi series in the world , second only to " " Doctor Who " " ( 1963-1989 ) , and the longest-running American produced sci-fi series , having surpassed " " The X-Files " " only a few months before it ended . " " Stargate SG-1 " " represents the cornerstone of the " " Stargate " " franchise . In 2004 , its success and popularity led to the production of a spin-off series entitled " " Stargate Atlantis " , " which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in August 2008 . Although plans for another feature film fell through , two direct-to-DVD films , " " Stargate : The Ark of Truth " " and " " Stargate Continuum " , " were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future . A third live-action series , " " Stargate Universe " , " is also due to premiere at some point next year . ( There was , unfortunately , an animated series , " " Stargate Infinity " , " which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better ) . Despite the end of " " SG-1 " " and " " Atlantis " " as continuing series , the future of " " Stargate " " looks very bright indeed.In conclusion , while " " Stargate " " has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci-fi television franchises such as " " Star Trek " " and " " Doctor Who " , " its still relatively new compared to those two sci-fi giants and I have every confidence that it will continue for many , many years to come . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was in the film too , but i don 't know if they actually put this scene in . On the way back from a school trip ( in 2005 ) we stopped at a service station at the same time as they were doing the film , and we were asked ( the whole of us ) to run in and shout Go ! Freebird ! We were all around 10 years old , could anyone who has seen the film tell me if that part was actually kept in the film , it would be great to know ! I remember I thought the film had never come out , because it was another 2 and a half years before it was released . All of your comments seem to be good so I 'm guessing it has been quite a successful film , I might buy it , but first I would like to know if I 'm in it ! : D Thank you , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is a fascinating drama about the Making of a movie . The Actor and the Actress really can 't stand each other , but we build up to a scene in which they are to have sex - she for the first time , per script . The actress shows little emotion on or off camera in the plot , aside from she is freezing in the early scenes on a beach . The actor is self absorbed and increasingly defies the direction of the Director , Jeanne . I could not help being drawn in to the drama of ' how are these two possibly going to ACT their way thru a Sex Scene ? ' That drama in itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay performed for the cameras . Not that Roxane Mesquida isn 't lovely and worth seeing naked ! However , there is a pretty young stage hand who walks thru a few scenes as an extra . I think that is her in the far left edge of one of the pictures ( 2 of 9 ) here in IMDb . I don 't even know if this girl is credited , but when she walks by ( fully dressed of course ) in confident indifference with her short blonde hair -- SHE is Sexy ! WHO IS THIS GIRL ? ? ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There is absolutely no doubt that this version of Tarzan is the closest to Burroughs ' vision . While he gladly collected his royalties from the films produced during his lifetime , he frequently made it clear that they were little more than the bastard children of his tales . The film studios ' ludicrous obsession with casting Olympic swimmers as Tarzan was beyond laughable . I guess we should consider ourselves lucky that they did not set their sights on shot-putters . Prior to this film , the most faithful adaptations were in comic strips and comic books . As fine as some of these were , we had to wait seven decades for a filmmaker with the integrity to respect the character as he had been created . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" 1st watched 10 / 10 / 2009 - 8 out of 10 ( Dir - Billy Wilder ) : Spectacular rendering of Lindbergh 's famous flight by James Stewart as Lindbergh and Director Billy Wilder . There isn 't really a whole lot of background built into this story but that 's OK because Wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from Lindbergh 's perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie . This early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well . Stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what Lindbergh went thru in this 33 hour solo flight across the Atlantic . And he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before -- which is amazing ! ! There is a little backstory about how he purchased the plane and got the financing , and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight . The story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite it 's age . I appreciate the fact that they didn 't throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself . Well done throughout . This is a classic movie that should be viewed by all . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I thought " " The River of Souls " " was a very good Babylon 5 movie , with some exceptional performances from Martin Sheen , Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane . If this were an episode of the series ( without the humour ) it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone stories of the series.Personally , I 've always preferred Scoggins to Christian , although granted JMS didn 't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the Byron / Telepath plot . If you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the " " poorer " " actors in those scenes , then this movie is solid stuff . Probably my third favourite of the four movies , but in no means bad at all . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The plot is somewhat original , and all the actors did their job pretty well . There is a plenty of comic relief , too . Some things do not make a lot of sense ( e.g. the first " " chase " " scene , why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave ? ) . The Russians actually speak Russian without accent , but the cars are extremely strange , with models spanning like 50 years , and so the place seems weirdly out of time . Overall , if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Get this film if at all possible . You will find a really good performance by Barbara Bach , beautiful cinematography of a stately ( and incredibly clean ) but creepy old house , and an unexpected virtuoso performance by 혚 " " The Unseen " . " I picked up a used copy of this film because I was interested in seeing more of Bach , whom I 'd just viewed in " " The Spy Who Loved Me . " " I love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little . So : we start with a nice fresh premise . TV reporter Bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a California town , Solvang , that celebrates its Swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival . She brings along a camerawoman , who happens to be her sister , and another associate . ( The late Karen Lamm plays Bach 's sister , and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to , it is just too funny watching Bach ( Mrs. Ringo Starr ) and Lamm ( Mrs. Dennis Wilson ) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel . ) ) Anyway 혚 Bach 's disgruntled beau follows her to Solvang , as he 's not done arguing with her . There 's a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn 't wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career . The ladies arrive in Solvang to do the assignment for their station , only to find their reservations were given away to someone else . ( Maybe to Bach 's boyfriend , because think of it 혯 where 's he gonna stay ? ) . The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go . Mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum , they catch the interest of proprietor Mr. Keller ( the late Sidney Lassick ) , who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home , insisting his wife will be happy to receive them . Oh no ! Next thing we know Keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife , warning her that company 's coming and threatening that she 'd better play along . Trouble in paradise ! The ladies are eager to settle in and get back to Solvang to shoot footage and interview Swedes , but one of the girls doesn 't feel good . Bach and Lamm leave her behind , wondering to themselves about Mrs. Keller ( played heartbreakingly by pretty Lelia Goldoni ) who looks like she just lost her best pal . Speaking of which 혚 under-the-weather Vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub , not realizing that Keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole . She hears him , thinks he 's come to deliver linen , and calls out her thanks . Lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn 't get a long enough look . After he 's left , poor Vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast ( in a really decent , frightening round of action ) by something BIG that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor 혚 The Unseen ! Lamm comes home next ( Bach is out finishing an argument with her beau ) and can 't find anyone in the house . She knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen , and , on hands and knees to collect it , her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille 혚 attracting The Unseen again ! Well , at about the time poor Lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen , we do a flashback into Mr. Keller 's past and get the full story of what his sick , sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn 't smile much . Bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are . Meanwhile , Lassick has been apprised of the afternoon 's carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can 't let Bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home . He tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the Keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us.I cannot say enough for Stephen Furst , whom I 'd never seen before ; it 's obvious that he did his homework for this role , studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged ; Bach and Goldoni , each in their diverse way , just give the movie luster . Not only that , but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution . No stupid cheap tricks , eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners ... A real treat for your collection . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It seems everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and say " " Maha Go Go Go " .... " The word is MACHA ........ Like " " Mach " ..... " Pronounced maa - ka " ... " I grew up with this series in the early 70 's here in LA on the late and VERY lamented channel 56 ... Before that there was Tetsuwan Atomu ( Astro Boy ) , dating from 1963 on ol ' KHJ TV . Astro Boy was the first TV example of anime we got here in the states ... I was into anime as a kid and followed it until the late 80 's when , by then it 'd become a series of badly animated " " talking heads " , " a phenomenon which has only gotten worse . ' Nuff said.As for " " Speed Racer " , " I really enjoyed the basics there , the POV shots , the cinematic aspects of live action skillfully adopted to animation ... That was fairly typical of most Japanese anime back then ... Graphics graphics graphics ! Take note sometime how obviously the series was inspired by Stanley Kramer 's film " " Grand Prix " " ( 1966 ) , especially the redone American credits .... Oh yeah , I have the original comics from which the series is based , so I know of which I speak.What were we doing animation-wise besides crap like Johnny Quest ? ..... Th ' same ol ' stuff we 'd been doin ' since the 20 's .... Ho-hum ! I guess the real problem I had / have with the way anime was / is shown on American TV is the hatchet job done on the scripts , credits , etc to " " sanitize " " them for American audiences ... I won 't go into other programs as we 're talking ' Speed here.Look at clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the culprits here , as he was 99 % responsible for the re-writes of the series ... Not to mention the voice of Speed , Racer X and others ... Between him and the goofs at Trans / Lux ( Think Felix the Cat and the Mighty Hercules - oy vey ! ) they took a slick , very sophisticated show and dropped it down to the level of Sesame Street . Think " " Cruncher Bloch " , " The " " Forthebird Company " , " " " Skull Duggery " ... " If I go on I 'll puke.This series dates from 40-odd years ago but I , at the time , was keen enough to feel insulted by the dumbing down of this and other Japanese programs ... I mean it 's obvious when someone 's getting ' killed but they either remove it or gloss it over ........ Pleeeeeze ! Good show - originally . Sadly all the more recent incarnations of the series have that CRAPPY " " made in Korea " " look , not to mention being nauseatingly " " pc " " in content . Even the Japanese outsource their animation now .. Try watchin ' the original Japanese opening on YouTube sometime ... It sends chills up my spine ..... If only ...... Oh well .

" John and his wife Emily , accompanied by their child Edward venture from the comfortable environs of suburbia to the village where the husband spent some of his childhood . There has been a death in the family and John must begin proceedings to take control of an old ramshackle cottage , situated by the seaside and once inhabited by an old man who has apparently committed suicide.Sceptical about the circumstances of the death , John divorces himself from his family and from reality , puts his own life in peril , and puts on the clothes of the old man who is now dead.The film now changes - nothing is what it seems - the people of his past appear , in full Gothic / hillbilly glory - his wife worries about his mental state - and his son disappears into the reeds.John finds that the old man didn 't commit suicide , that his death is far more mysterious and strange . In a spine chilling finale , we learn that the events of the film actually never happened and that the entire narrative was imagined by the little boy , Edward , who is struggling to come to terms with his parents ' divorce proceedings.Modern Love is a macabre piece of high art cinema , a puzzling and perverse piece of pretentiousness , full of vague suggestion and unexplored red-herrings . It is humourless and seemingly unconcerned with current Indie trends which both validates its creators , but also renders it pass챕.But the weaknesses of this Australian film are fully outweighed by its sheer muscular cinematic vision , its bloody-minded and uncompromising precision and its oddball Euro horror . The bastardry of script norms and lack of slick dialogue pales into insignificance against a backdrop of noir and a lead performance that needs to be seen to be appreciated.One of the most aggressively weird Australian films in years . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie should have easily qualified as a filmthat best promotes human understanding among people.It may be rather annoying to even try to comprehend that a young Jewish southern girl could would give shelter to an escaped German prisoner of war.Kristy McNichol depicts an amazing portrait of the unhappy , young girl thirsting for acceptance and love . Michael Constantine gave a remarkable performance as her difficult father and Esther Rolle , as the maid , Ruth , gave a superb Emmy-winning performance as an understanding maid caught up with these events.Bruce Davison portrays the German who is supposedly not guilty of Nazi atrocities . This is how his role appears . He has escaped , but he joined the German army and he might have been a member of the Hitler youth movement.The action takes place in 1944 Georgia , in a rural area . The townspeople are filled with prejudice . Even the FBI inspector acts as if he would like to get something on the Jews . Notice the opposite interpretation that as McNichol is in bed , Davison is hunted down and ultimately shot . It is interesting to see that society views McNichol as a traitor for harboring an escaped prisoner of war . The film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter . Constantine 's outburst at his daughter at the end is some acting . As the mother , Barbara Barrie , is given little to do . It was annoying that she is stereotyped as the typical Jewish mother with that loud shade of lipstick on her lips.Memorably done and well worth viewing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Brazilian films often get more positive appraisals than they actually deserve . Rather incredibly , Contra Todos ( Against Everybody ) ( original title , which the producers discarded : God Against Everybody ) got very low GPA ( grade point average ) in this website . It seems to be bluntly rejected by female spectators at large . Actually , it is not so brutal . I mean as far as graphical violence is concerned . Its brutality is intrinsic as it portrays would-be lumpens , I mean underdog citizens who in fact possess high-tech equipment , who coldly perform murder orders in exchange of " " grana gra첬da " . " Is this post-modern man ? Is his / her only worry a quick , almost impersonal , ultra permissive lay , amidst over satiating meals ? The picture is probably the best Brazilian film of 2004 , so far . Its shining editing style , 횪 la Godard , its curious soundtrack counterpoints , its more than efficient overall cast and , above all , its original narration , with subtle non-chronological hidden points that only come to light in the epilogue , deserve at least an 8 mark . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just can 't agree with the above comment - there 's lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one , it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it 's effective use of silence . What 's more , it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way , not pulling any punches in what it shows , yet not dwelling and over-sensationalising the subject matter. it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art-house cinema , and deserves a place amongst the canon of ' different ' horror films like The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring ( both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on ) . It 's definitely worth seeing if you 're interested in the edges of horror cinema . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I love dogs , and the most interesting character in this movie is a Golden Retriever . He is smarter , better looking and more interesting than any of the human characters .

Mad scientists create a monster that gets loose and a teen age boy and his wonder dog collaborate to destroy it . All in all the movie is a dog .

" This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV . I own all 9 seasons on DVD and literally could watch them over and over . Anyone who does not find this show hilarious , heartwarming , entertaining , and laugh out loud hysterical , is crazy ! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there . My boyfriend and I love going to stand up comedy shows in Boston ( where we live ) and have seen Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine ( Danny ) once . They are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work . There are so many comedians out there that are just awful and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of real comedy . Leah Remini , although a snob and bitch in real life ( so I have read ) is an amazing actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms .

" An unassuming , subtle and lean film , " " The Man in the White Suit " " is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from Ealing studios . While I suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure , I doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot , the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film 's course.The genuinely great Alec Guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as Ealing 's inspired " " Kind Hearts and Coronets " " from 1949 . This time , he merely plays one character rather than eight , but as the unworldly inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton , he always finds the correct tone and expression . Along with Guinness ' subtle , expressive performance , the rest of the cast are effective . Of the main players , Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger do stand out . Thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee , while Parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father . Father , that is , of Joan Greenwood , the deftly delectable comic actress , who is at her insurmountable peak in this film . Resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction , she is quite sublime in this film , a fine contrast with the similarly unusual , but more maladroit Guinness . The scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing ... The themes are handled very effectively , with no easy morals drawn . The complexities of the relationships between science , business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined . Expertly helmed by Alexander Mackendrick , this film is technically adept in all areas ; evocative photography , fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script , all quietly impress . A thoroughly satisfying film , with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent.Rating : - * * * * 1 / 2 / * * * * * , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Great voices , lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie . The addition of " " character " " to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning , particularly the relationship between the older fellow , Shadow , and the young hellraiser , Chance .

Sally Field is lovable in anything , but really shines in this film as the proud feline , Sassy .

" A couple move into their dream home , unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery . The film is said to have been based on a true story , although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed . The plot is hardly unique - see Spielberg 's ' Poltergeist ' ( 1982 ) . Within a short time , they experience various supernatural phenomena : these range from the disturbing - mysterious shadows , the serious illness of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous - toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control . There is little depth to the story : once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery , we do not learn anything more . The plot does not seem to develop .

" If Jean Renoir 's first film " " Whirlpool of Fate " " first takes us into the world of the countryside , the rivers , the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore , it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged , the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards . Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great " " Grand Illusion " " and " " Rules of the Game . " " This is beautifully filmed , with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the film 's interiors , and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well , particularly from Werner Krauss ' Muffat . But the glamorous and sultry Ms. Hessling , who at first appears as if she might give Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampishness , never goes beyond a one note , selfish harlot portrayal . Perhaps this is in part a problem with the script , which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions ; not having read the novel I 'm not really clear on whether the choices were well-made or not.Still , the differences between Nana 's suitors are well-drawn , and I particularly liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo 's Vandeuvres -- the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other , particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat , and we wonder if violence will erupt -- this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it has.Far from his greatest achievement , and for me probably just shy overall of " " Whirlpool of Fate " , " this is still well worth seeing for Renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Insignificance " " is a far from great film , from a stage play , directed by Nic Roeg . In the scheme of Roeg 's films , this is above the level of most of his post- " " Don 't Look Now " " work , which is characterised by judicious use of Theresa Russell as lead actress . She 's actually very good here , and far from the problem in other Roeg films like " " Bad Timing " " and " " Cold Heaven " . " As the " " Actress " , " who is Marilyn Monroe , Russell is very effective , portraying her as a thoroughly depressive , but likeable siren . She plays well alongside Michael Emil as Einstein , who is excellent to say the least . He looks the part admirably , and while Theresa Russell doesn 't look exactly like Monroe , she certainly is attractive enough to make the part ring true . Other players are adequate if not quite as arresting as Emil and Russell are . A pretty workable , intelligent script is directed well by Roeg , but certainly not brilliantly , like " " Walkabout " " or " " Performance " . " As in other later Roeg films , he tends to rely too much on vague , insubstantial flashbacks , that add very little to the film . In many ways the film would have worked better as a shorter ( say , 60 minutes ) , more modest piece . Still , a quite acceptable , passable film . At times quite excellent , but somewhat lacking overall . Rating : - * * * 1 / 2 / * * * * * , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother . The main character , Lin Macadam , played by James Stewart , represents justice and righteousness . His brother , who operates under the persona of Dutch Henry Brown , played by Stephen McNally , stands for the classic stage-coach robbing western outlaw , chased by his brother for having killed their father . The world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town , and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman Wyat Earp . Present as well are such flat characters typical of the western , such as the murderous Indian warrior , the besieged cavalryman , and the bonnet-clad damsel in distress . Another important archetype in this film , that which gives the film it 's name , is a custom made Winchester rifle . The weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably . Once it is stolen from its rightful owner , it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it . In this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in Raiders of the Lost Ark , and the blood stained letter in Saving Private Ryan . This gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns , a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols . Being essentially a revenge film , it shares this element with many other examples of the genre , such as Jack Arnold 's No Name on the Bullet , and Clint Eastwood 's Unforgiven . There is also a tacit theme of rape in Winchester ' 73 . Waco Johnny Dean , one of the film 's villains played very effectively by Dan Duryea , abducts a woman after killing her husband . The volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband , and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off . Waco Johnny Dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous Winchester rifle . The main story of Winchester ' 73 is reminiscent of the mythological tale of Jason and his quest for the golden fleece , as told in Apollonius ' Argonautica . Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality . Like Jason , Stewart 's character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one-of-a- kind prize . Another theme in Winchester ' 73 that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers . Several stories of antiquity deal with this issue , such as the Hebrew Bible 's tale of Cain and Abel , and the vulgate tale of Romulus and Remus . As for the theme of abduction and rape present in Anthony Mann 's film , it is present in many mythological works , such as the rape of Europa as told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses . Winchester ' 73 is a fine example of the western genre , and acts as the objective correlative for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong Nicolas Cage fan . Back in the mid-80 's I taped this movie ( when VCR 's were impossible to do this with ! ! ) and would watch it over and over . Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here . And , he looks wonderful and has no affecting " " acting-isms " " ( see " " Peggy Sue Got Married " " to know what I mean about that ! ! ) . I measure all his performances against this one . He was so perfectly cast as the cool punk guy with the edgy friends . The music was GREAT . The Plimsouls ! The Psychodelic Furs ! Modern English ! Men At Work ! Whenever I hear " " Melt With You " " I am taken back to the finale of this movie . What ever happened to his cute costar , Deborah Foreman ? And his hysterical friend , Cameron Dye ? Certainly took a different turn than Nicolas ! Interestingly , the slutty friend ( Elizabeth Daily ) ended up being the voice of Tommy from the Rugrats ( she is billed as E.G. Daily for that horrid show ) ! Bizarre ! IF you want to take a great trip back to the 80 's , watch this movie . It is definitely a classic . Like Totally ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I believe a lot of people down rated the movie , NOT because of the lack of quality . But it did not follow the standard Hollywood formula . Some of the conflicts are not resolved . The ending is just a little too real for others , but the journey the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought provoking and very entertaining . Even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting , the directing also is excellent and innovative.This is a 10 in my book , this movie will take you places the normal and expected Hollywood script will not . They took some risks and did a few things different . I think it worked well , I am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer , not accepting someone else 's interpretation . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Japan is in serious trouble . Demons have infested Edo , taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will . On top of that , the rebirth of Ashura , Queen of the demons , is nigh . The only thing that stands against this grave threat are the Demon Wardens , a fearsome group of warriors , who might just be as bad as the demons themselves.Izumo is a retired Demon Warden , who five years ago , took up theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child ( In a battle that 's strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from Dusk till Dawn ) . One night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki . Their fortunes intertwine ( literally ) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies.If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy / Swordplay epic , you 'd be wrong . In fact , there 's nothing typical about Ashura . It is a hodge-podge of many different genre 's of film . Those just mentioned , as well as a comedy , drama , and romance . Director Yojiro Takita ( Onmyoji ) juggles the genre 's fairly respectfully ( Although , the comedy seems forced in some scenes ) and the end result is a ridiculous , but really fun popcorn movie.To be sure , there are flaws in the film . Some of the humor seems contrived , and out of place . And the acting isn 't the greatest . But seriously , do you watch Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy films for the great acting performances ? ? No , we watch them for the action and the crazy CG visuals , all of which Ashura has in Spades . Not to be misleading , the film is not all action , but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy.Bottom line ; the films has it 's faults and is not a martial arts epic , but it doesn 't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action . The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same , their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flick.My Rating 7 out of 10 . Fun popcorn movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I truly hate musicals because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually spoil scenes , but this one is completely different - it 's simply brilliant . Plot perhaps isn 't any challenge for the viewers , but the simplicity of people life stories makes this movie great.I 've seen it at least dozen times and still I 'm not tired with the plot , characters or music ( I just love the soundtrack - it 's the only soundtrack that I 've really wanted to have and most probably will remain the only one that I owe ) .For me it 's a must-seen kind of movie , great characters compiled with entertaining songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie end . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this film for the first time last night . I have been thinking about it all night and this morning . I cannot say that it was my favorite film , at least not yet . I need to see it again . The cinematography is stunning . Each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has Wim Wenders 's name attached to it.It is always tempting to see de Chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom , but in this case the analogy fits . In many ways the figure of Malkovich walking through the fog and wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the off-canvas statue that haunts Milan in the major works of the Italo-Greek painter . He is slightly menacing , a presence who watches and , in his capacity as a film director , exerts influence on the entire story . The dedicated Wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of Damiel and Cassiel wandering through the streets of Berlin , watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants . And , following the Himmel Uber Berlin metaphor , the angel ( or in this case Malkovich the Director ) gets to interact with one of the stories . At this point I have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far . I need to see the movie again . I am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring Malkovich 's monologue together . Perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious , empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication . Maybe that is the whole point of it . No one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework.We must be careful when throwing around the word " " pretentious . " " It is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension , but that leads to a terrifying mental state , one in which the only conversation seen as genuine , earthy or authentic is the most banal . When we shun all discussions of philosophy , God , existence , meaning and all that brain candy , we are setting our culture up to die a slow , stupid and ugly death . Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us . It certainly is not the only theme of the film , but I think that it cannot be ignored.The other ( and most obvious ) leitmotif is that of satisfaction . There is a lot here on that , and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the 1000 word limit for this review.My advice is to see the film . But I offer a caveat : it is not an autonomous film ( at least I don 't think so yet ) . Some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film . Par-dela les nuages is one of those films . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Okay , so the plot is on shaky ground . Yeah , all right , so there are some randomly inserted song and / or dance sequences ( for example : Adam 's concert and Henri 's stage act ) . And Leslie Caron can 't really , um , you know ... act.But somehow , ' An American In Paris ' manages to come through it all as a polished , first-rate musical--largely on the basis of Gene Kelly 's incredible dancing talent and choreography , and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with Caron . ( He needs to , because she seems to have a ... problem with emoting . ) The most accomplished and technically awe-inspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16-minute ballet towards the end of the film . It 's stunningly filmed , and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully . But my favourite number would have to be Kelly 's character singing ' I Got Rhythm ' with a bunch of French school-children , then breaking into an array of American dances . It just goes to prove how you don 't need special effects when you 've got some real * talent * .Not on the ' classics ' level with ' Singin ' In The Rain ' , but pretty high up there nonetheless .

" It 's true that Danny Steinmann 's " " The Unseen " " is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot , no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single clich챕 the genre has brought forward over the decades , but that doesn 't necessarily make it a bad film . On the contrary , my friends and I were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80 's shock- feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting . The beautiful and ambitious reporter Jennifer Fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little Californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival , but their hotel forgot to register their booking . In their search for a place to stay , the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator Ernest Keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion . One by one the girls experience that Keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister Victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house . " " The Unseen " " can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics " " Psycho " " and " " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " . " The plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films , like twisted family secrets in the cellar , voyeurism , crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens . Still , I don 't consider these to be negative remarks , as " " The Unseen " " is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade . Although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast , director Steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house " " unseen " " like the title promised . The casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre . Sydney Lassick , immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient Charley Cheswick in " " One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest " " is truly the ideal choice for the role of Ernest Keller . His persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed . Also Stephen Furst , who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen , gives away a tremendous performance as " " Junior " . " He looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to Jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving . " " The Unseen " " is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early 80 's film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70 's exploitation and generally weird stuff . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with ' House of Games , ' a character study fraught with psychological overtones , in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game . Margaret Ford ( Lindsay Crouse ) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel , ' Driven . ' Still , she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life ; there 's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve , and it primes her vulnerability . When a patient , Billy Hahn ( Steven Goldstein ) , confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers , and that they 're going to kill him if he doesn 't pay , she decides to intervene on his behalf . This takes her to the ' House of Games , ' a seedy little dive where she meets Mike ( Joe Mantegna ) , a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world . Instead of the ' twenty-five large ' that Billy claimed he owed , Mike shows her his book , and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars . And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean , if she 'll agree to do him one simple favor , which involves a card game he has going on in the back room . In the middle of a big hand , Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes ; while he is gone , her job is to watch for the ' tell ' of one of the other players . By this time , not only Margaret , but the audience , as well , is hooked . The dialogue , and Mamet 's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines , is mesmerizing . As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling , surreal realm of existence , and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game , we are swept right along with her . From that first memorable encounter , when he demonstrates what a ' tell ' is and how it works , to the lessons of the ' short con , ' to the stunning climax of this film , Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless . And nothing is what it seems . In the end , Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature , and about herself . She changes ; and whether or not it 's for the better is open to speculation . Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film ; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows , and does . Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here ; you feel the rigid , up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm , self-assured exterior , and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her , she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated . She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does , and makes you understand it , as well . The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum ( Joey ) , Lilia Skala ( Dr. Littauer ) , J.T. Walsh ( The Businessman ) , Ricky Jay ( George ) and William H. Macy ( Sergeant Moran ) . ' House of Games ' is the quintessential Mamet ; he 's written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since , and will no doubt grace us with more in the future . But this film will be the one that defines him ; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up . You 'll find it under ' Perfection . ' This is one great movie you do not want to miss .

" Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was even 10 % as deranged as the one in this film , well then I guess he could have turned out worse . Unfortunately , the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the picture 's box office appeal . Several times during the film Milligan 's ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends , and suddenly good-looking stand-ins for Milligan 's homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60 's guitar rock . It 's pretty easy to fast-forward through if you 're trying to pay attention to Milligan 's original film , which , unfortunately , is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes . What remains , however , is still compelling stuff . I don 't think I 've ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I came out of " " Dark Blue World " " feeling ( sigh ) ' so sad ' yet it was definitely a film needed to be made , and it 's truly well done from Czech Republic . It 's entertaining in spite of the ' sad ' premise . It is full of feelings , the bonding and undeniably true friendship between the two lead characters - one mature lieutenant pilot ( Ondrej Vetch첵 as Franta ) and the young & ever-so-eager budding pilot ( Krystof H찼dek as Karel ) , the inevitable love triangle , and the now and then reminders of the grim prison situations in Czechoslovakia in the ' 50s . It 's all in one film put together , by the father screenwriter and son director team Zdenek and Jan Sver찼k ( previous achievement being the lovable " " Kolya " " ) .It 's not as long as " " East-West " " ( French " " Est-Ouest " " ) 1999 , which was heart wrenching , multi-layered story about a returning Russian doctor and French wife 's ill-fates after WWII in Russia . The plot of " " Tmavomodr첵 svet " " ( title in Czech ) is quite straightforward and has sprinkles of light humor . Music , songs of WWII England sung in Czech , modest special effects of pilots and air crafts in the sky - not elaborate like Hollywood - there 's no need to be bing , bang , boom all the time when showing air battle scenes . The sadness was explained up front in the beginning ( two paragraphs in English ) and wrap up with follow up paragraphs . The film is not totally subtitled , only when translating the Czech conversations - the rest are in English , be it very British or in Czech accents . ( So it 's a foreign film with English language and includes British actors . ) The three lead performances , especially of the two Czech pilots , were wonderfully delivered . There are nuances between the two of them , even though it 's the steadily mature vs. the eagerly young . I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald : yes , there 's " " Brassed Off " " 1996 opposite Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite ; remembered her from " " Hear My Song " " 1991 opposite Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty ; opposite Hugh Grant in " " Sirens " " 1994 and " " The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain " " 1995 , besides her appearances in PBS Masterpiece Theatre mini-series . ' So sad ' - the fact that heroes defending one 's country can be so ill fatedly treated and for so long ( 40 years ) . Thank goodness for worthwhile memories and the imprints of friendship unforgettable . Hence the pause for a ray of sunshine through a stain glass window ( ironic or coincidental that it 's of a church where the hard labor took place ) - symbolic of hope , never give up혚 Other recent films that have stories needed to be told : " " Kandahar " " ( with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas the Canadian from Afghanistan taking a journey to Kandahar with a personal ' mission ' in mind ) more than meets the eye behind a burqa by Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf . " " Everything Put Together " " ( with Radha Mitchell as a new mother facing SID - sudden infant death ) insightful film by Swiss director Marc Forster , and his much talked about controversial film " " Monster 's Ball " " ( I 've yet to catch ) with Halle Berry , Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle .

" No pun intended . I 'm not going to spoil anything about the story , but it 's safe to assume that you already know , what kind of character the main actor portrays . And of course being a priest while being " " naughty " " exaggerates all that . Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet.If you have seen Wook 's previous works / movies you know he is very visual ( in a good way ) and it shows again here . While it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface , it still has quite some heat hidden underneath . And when that boils , quite a few bad things start to happen . But through all that dark , there also moments of light ( fun ) to be had too .

" I 'm sure things didn 't exactly go the same way in the real life of Homer Hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book , Rocket Boys , but the movie " " October Sky " " ( an anagram of the book 's title ) is good enough to stand alone . I have not read Hickam 's memoirs , but I am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation . The film , directed by Joe Johnston and written by Lewis Colick , records the story of teenager Homer Hickam ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , beginning in October of 1957 . It opens with the sound of a radio broadcast , bringing news of the Russian satellite Sputnik , the first artificial satellite in orbit . We see a images of a blue-gray town and its people : mostly miners working for the Olga Coal Company . One of the miners listens to the news on a hand-held radio as he enters the elevator shaft , but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness , losing sight of the starry sky above him . A melancholy violin tune fades with this image . We then get a jolt of Elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting : October 5 , 1957 , Coalwood , West Virginia . Homer and his buddies , Roy Lee Cook ( William Lee Scott ) and Sherman O 'Dell ( Chad Lindberg ) , are talking about football tryouts . Football scholarships are the only way out of the town , and working in the mines , for these boys . " " Why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college , " " questions Homer . Roy Lee replies , " " They 're also the only ones who get the girls . " " Homer doesn 't make it in football like his older brother , so he is destined for the mines , and to follow in his father 's footsteps as mine foreman . Until he sees the dot of light streaking across the October sky . Then he wants to build a rocket . " " I want to go into space , " " says Homer . After a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother 's ( Natalie Canerday ) fence , Homer enlists the help of the nerdy Quentin Wilson ( Chris Owen ) . Quentin asks Homer , " " What do you want to know about rockets ? " " Homer quickly anwers , " " Everything . " " His science teacher at Big Creek High School , Miss Frieda Riley ( Laura Dern ) greatly supports Homer , and the four boys work on building rockets in Homer 's basement . His father , however , whose life is the mine , does not support him . John Hickam ( Chris Cooper ) believes that Homer shouldn 't waste his time on the rockets , that the coal mines are all that matter . The coal from the mines is used to make steel , and without steel , the country would be nothing . The difficult relationship between Homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships I have ever seen in a film . Miss Riley introduces Homer to the idea of entering the local science fair , with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship . " " You can 't just dream your way out of Coalwood , " " she tells Homer . Homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets , improving the models with each attempt . Despite the many attempts , the boys do not lose their determination . " " What are the chances of us winning that science fair , " " O 'Dell asks Homer in one of their more despairing moments . " " A million to one , " " answers Homer . " " That good ? " " O 'Dell replies , " " Well , why didn 't you say so ? " " The music , composed by Mark Isham , conveys sadness and hope at the same time , especially sad at a point when Homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of Coalwood . Rollicking 1950s ' rock and roll , including songs by The Coasters and Buddy Holly , occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light-hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers ' lives with the lives of the miners . The film , photographed by Fred Murphy , also uses colors to set moods and symbolize . The town of Coalwood , actually filmed in Tennessee , is washed with blues , grays , and browns . It 's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything- faces , clothes , houses , and roads . When a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys , it is obvious that they are from the world outside of Coalwood and the Olga Coal Company . The book on guided missile design that Miss Riley gives Homer is red . The red stands out enough against the blue-gray world of Coalwood to symbolize " " getting out " , " but it is still subtle . The reds are fleeting hints of a world that Homer only dreams of . Jake Gyllenhaal expresses such zeal , hope , and pertinacity as Homer Hickam that it is hard to believe he isn 't the real Homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film . Chris Cooper is also extraordinarily believable as Homer 's stubborn father , who doesn 't recognize , or just doesn 't want to admit , that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive . Homer , and everyone who encourages him in his rocket-building , is aware that the town is dying . With the community disintegrating , the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys ' demonstrations . Again , I 'm sure things didn 't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them , but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism ? " " October Sky " " has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

His alibi is the mystery woman but no-one can remember seeing her and , as a result of this , Scott is sentenced to die for the murder of his wife . His secretary Kansas ( Ella Raines ) is not convinced of his guilt and sets out to find the woman who can save him from the death penalty.This is a good film and the viewer is 100 % behind the attempts of Kansas to get to the truth . We follow her through some memorable scenes , eg , her pursuit of Mac the bartender ( Andrew Tombes ) at night and the claustrophobic venue where Cliff the drummer ( Elisha Cook Jr ) takes her to hang out , drink and dance while he jams with his friends . This is such a blatant depiction of sexual desire that it is a stand-out part of the film as everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically for the duration of the scene . Ella Raines is good in the female lead role and Thomas Gomez makes a likable policeman . Alan Curtis started well as the confused , innocent man , but once he is arrested his performance took a left turn as he became thoroughly unpleasant to Kansas for no reason . God knows why she stuck by him.The film doesn 't keep you guessing as to who the murderer is as we know from about halfway through the film , but this doesn 't matter . In fact , it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story as we will Kansas to discover what is going on and then to get the hell out ! It 's a good film with some great scenes but although Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role , I just never like him in anything that I see him in .... someone hand me a neck-tie ..... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've waited to see this movie for a long time and at last I could manage to see it in Istanbul Film Festival . Maybe because I expected too much from this film and that 's why i was slightly disappointed . I was not the best movie from Korea but still it is really worth watching.The subject was nice and the film makes you keep watching without getting bored though it is long . But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another . However , the acting of Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful . It was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and I think this movie wouldn 't be that nice if she was not in the leading role . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a producer of indie movies and a harsh critic of such , I have to say I loved this movie . It is funny and intelligent , well directed and entertaining .

My favorite songs are " " You can 't keep a good dog down " " and that song about sharing , I think it 's called " " What 's mine is yours " . " This was the last movie with Judith Barsi , who played the voice of Anne-Marie . My favorite character is Charlie but I find Itchy 's voice is so fun to hear . Although some scenes I actually found scary , I still have a hard time watching the scene with Charlie 's dream , and Carface scares the crap out of me . Other characters like King Gator I found really funny . The ending was adorable and was actually sad , made me cry a little . I give this movie 7 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I recently picked up all three Robocop films in one box set , rather cheaply and the only reason I did this was for the special edition of the superb first one . I have seen Robocop 2 before but not for 17 years , the year it came out . I have never watched it since because I can still remember how disappointed I was when I discovered how appalling it really is . Its a complete mess really , it has all the signs of a troubled production with so many sub-plots going on at the same time . It has a very uneven tone also and it is also one of the nastiest films I have ever seen . I don 't mind a little violence , the first one was incredibly violent but this one is just plain nasty . Also the SFX is terrible even for 1990 , say hello to bad stop motion . Also having a drug dealing , cursing kid as a villain is just a little too much . Peter Weller at least had the common sense not to return for the next one . The only positive thing I can say for this film is it does have a couple of nice gags , like the thank you for not smoking one and the kiddie baseball team robbing an electrics store . To quote the kid who plays the villain " " It sucks " " , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
People seem to be expecting Citizen Kane here ! The Planet is a B-monster movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed . The director clearly has something to offer - not so sure about some of the cast . As for the effects ? 짙8000 ain 't a lot of effects budget.I for one would happily recommend this outing to a sci-fi head or anyone who doesn 't take monster movies too seriously . If so ? Watch 3colours blue instead.I noticed one review saying it had ripped off Alien . Like Alien didn 't rip things off . The best thing about the film ? The director . The worst thing about the film ? The cast . Maybe it 's time for the Director to move from Glasgow to London and find some talent . In the meantime - well done . At least you 're trying to do something . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Three children are born at the exact same time , during a lunar eclipse.Just before their 10th birthday they embark on a killing spree . " " Bloody Birthday " " is a typical slasher from early 80 's.It 's a pretty average stuff with plenty of nudity.The evil children never generate any menace and there is almost no suspense.There is also no gore or scares in " " Bloody Birthday " , " but the film is mildly entertaining.Unfortunately no real explanation is provided for the kids sudden homicidal mania.The murder scenes are quite gruesome for example we 've got death by handgun , baseball bat , skipping rope and shovel.So if you 're a fan of early 80 's slasher movies give this one a look . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Whoever said that horror wasn 't an educational film genre , huh ? Thanks to this marvelous Hammer short movie , I now at least know NEVER to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house , because he might just be hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts & mind forever ! Thank you Hammer ! The tenth episode in the House of Horror series is another one I 've been looking forward to seeing , mainly because the guy in the director 's chair was Don Sharp ; one of Britain 's finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated . Sharp was responsible for some very cool Hammer films , like " " Kiss of the Vampire " " and " " Rasputin : The Mad Monk " , " as well as some overlooked independent productions like " " Dark Places " " and " " Psychomania " . " His contribution to House of Horror is easily one of the best in the series , with a complex yet fascinating plot outline and revolving on delightful occult themes . The plot centers on two antique dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror , but it 's actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon Choronzhon ; the demonic guardian of the abyss . The mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their ceremonies , but Michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device . When he picks up a clearly petrified girl who 's running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed , Michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy . Satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical British horror topics , but David Fischer 's screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot twits , among which a highly inventive climax . There 's also plenty of tension to admire , the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid ( especially John Carson as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie ) . Recommended ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm slowly ploughing through as many Hong Kong action films as I can get my hands on and came across this gem - mainly due to Ching Wan Lau who is one of my favourite actors.Its a great action film although not as OTT as the title might suggest . It moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyable.The biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack . It would appear that Rob Dougan - the guy who did the ' Clubbed To Death ' song which was popular in ' The Matrix ' has lifted the soundtrack from Big Bullet and compiled it into one of the tracks on his ' Furious Angels ' album ; the tune in question is called ' Im not driving anymore ' and is also the opening tune for the TV series ' Law and Order ' AND the opening track on the ' Matrix Reloaded ' DVD menu teaser !

" Thought at first this film would be your typical Western film , however , it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the very end , which turned out very unusual . Charlton Heston , ( Sam Burgade ) , " " Midway " , " ' 76 , had past experiences with James Coburn , ( Zach Provo ) , " " Deadfall " , " ' 93 , and Zach never forgave Sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back . Unfortunately , Barbara Hershey , ( Susan Burgade ) , " " The Portrait of a Lady " , " ' 96 , managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone . Sam Burgade had to make some very hard decisions and and I was quite surprised at the conclusion .

" Under the assured direction of F. Gary Gray , " " Italian Job " " never loses its grip on being cool and fun . Although the material is rehashed and average , the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfyingly good . The tone could easily have been much heavier , considering the murder-revenge plotline but F. Gary Gray keeps the tone light by good humor , snappy dialogs and pulsating music .

While some of us punctuate with commas and periods , he uses the f-word . Also , if you can 't laugh at yourself , never watch this ; you will feel the fool.Incidentally , I 've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live , and this is by far his best work .

" The first thing you meet when you study fascism is ostracism : because this " " philosophy " " is a fake one , there 's a need to use scapegoats to assess the " " thought " . " Ettore Scola 's movie , probably his masterpiece , focuses on the outcasts , the scapegoats of the regime.Of the historical event ( Hitler and Mussolini 's alliance ) , we will see almost nothing : some military march , some garlands , some scattered voices .. Our two heroes are not invited for the feast of virility . " " Genius is essentially masculine " " : this is the golden rule Antonietta ( a never better Sophia Loren ) embroidered on her cushion ; Antonietta , whose world amounts to her kitchen , whose pride is her offsprings .At the beginning of the movie , she 's a victim of this hypermacho world , but she does not realize it.She thinks she should be happy.Gabriel , on the contrary , is politically aware , he knows about the cancer that is destroying inexorably his country.But as a gay man , he is no longer part of it , he 's about to be arrested.Forgetting everything that comes between them , they realize what they have in common and they make love.This is an act of rebellion , particularly for Antonietta , whose ethic should forbid such a thing.Becoming an adulteress in a land where politics and religion combine to repress women as ever leads her to some kind of political awareness.One of the last shots shows her listening to the news on the radio.Expect the unexpected and maybe a doctrine which denies the human being his intimate personality will see that its days are numbered . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I can see why this film was Oscar-nominated for Best Live Action Short , as it was constructed masterfully . Even if you don 't particularly like the Blues ( though to me , this sounded much more like jazz ) , you can easily appreciate this film . It is simply very well made , though for the life of me , I can 't see why director Gjon Mili only got to direct one film--this one . In other words , the film is nominated and yet the director didn 't get any sort of career boost . As for the black performers , I could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear , as unfortunately most of white society have indifference ( or worse ) for blacks or " " that kind of music " . " If you do watch this film , if you aren 't particularly enjoying the earlier portion , skip ahead to about the 5 : 50 mark--where it picks up considerably .

" I 'm an admirer of Hal Hartley 's films , especially 1997 's " " Henry Fool . " " " " Fay Grim " " is a sequel to that film , and has a similar style and sense of humor . The plot , however , is completely different . Fay Grim ( played brilliantly by the iconic Parker Posey ) tries to track down her missing husband 's notebooks , and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage . The supporting cast ( most of the folks from the first film as well as Jeff Goldblum , Saffron Burrows , and a much-welcomed return from 90s indie-darling Elina Lowensohn ) is excellent and the film has lots of surprises . The director claims this is part of a " " Star Wars " " -like trilogy , serving as the " " Empire Strikes Back " " of the series If this is true , I can 't wait to see the third installment !

" This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941 . Two brothers , one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs ( obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time ) . Well , the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother , Pete , decides to enlist . He gives his prize egg to his little brother , Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte . Well , Willie isn 't having any of it , if Pete can be a soldier so can he . He heads to Memphis , showing his stubbornness and determination as he gets the better of several adults along the way . After finding the enlistment center in Memphis , he demands to see his brother , pulling a knife on a lieutenant and wounding him in the process . We are shown the devotion and love of a little brother ( Jonathan Furr ) . He delivers a impeccable performance as a stubborn strong-willed boy in the gentler times of yesteryear . The movie tries and mostly succeeds in showing how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in one 's youth . As the two brothers reunite shortly , the movie delivers a cathartic cry as the brotherly love envelops us all.This movie is like a cold bottle of water . Maybe Dasani or Aquafina , good , clear water with a flavorful mineral packet , but not pure natural spring water like Evian . Still , it quenches your thirst and you don 't doubt its purity and quenching effects . It is more run of the mill and less expensive than some , but gets the job done , leaving one refreshed and detoxified afterwards . 7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

i was 9 when i first saw this on TV. on a Friday night. i remember the full page ad in the TV guide with the picture of the Rex. amazing how some things stick in your mind after 30 years . Anyway if your a kid who likes monster movies this one is entertaining enough especially with boone and Keats raging at each other . Special effects are no harryhausen but its worth the hour and a half if you find it somewhere on late night TV . Haven 't seen it in a few years for some reason these classics fade from cable TV . If you do catch it on late night don 't be too critical just grab some snacks and enjoy it. it might be cheesy but i thought it was a lot better than the kong remake that came out in the theaters a year before . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a local performer , I thought that " " Grease " " showcased what Broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population . Although my favorites did not win ( but came in second ) , I enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as a performer.They brought in Olivia Newton-John because she is the obvious link between the Broadway production and television audiences.They sang songs from the movie ( " " Hopelessly Devoted , " " et al ) because these songs will be included in the new production.I agree with the earlier comment made that the B 'Way cast looks so much older , but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on Broadway and worked their tails off to be there . If the entire cast was green and fresh then I believe that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy , about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writer 's family , at her farm in Connecticut . The problem is she has no husband , baby , or farm , as she writes about in her column , and she can 't even cook ; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend " " Uncle " " Felix , owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City.Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas . A scheme is hastily planned , with her stuffy fianc챕 providing an actual Connecticut farm , neighbors providing a borrowed baby , and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isn 't looking . But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve , romantic complications ensue , as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy Navy man and vice versa.This is a charming , warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent , aided by such marvelous character actors as Sydney Greenstreet , Una O 'Connor , S.Z.Sakall , and many others . A Christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see , and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise , for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough , bitchy women in femme fatale roles . Truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I highly recommend this film . Set in the Bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 Paris , it is in most respect a classic film noir script : lady in peril , sister trying to find her , honest cop fighting everyone . Luckily , it avoids being stereotypical , and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting , innovative visuals . The film might remind you of Sin City in look , but it has an even sharper , even more graphic novel look that I found really compelling . Each frame , each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer . In terms of story and artwork , you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties ( or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer ) and movies like Casablanca , as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations . Make any excuse you need to see this film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Astaire and Rogers at the height of their popularity . In 1936 Americans thought of the Navy as a place for song and dance . WWII was still a few years away .

By the way , notice the cameo roles for Betty Grable and a glamorous Lucile Ball.A load of Irving Berlin songs , including the famous " " Let 's Face the Music and Dance " . " In that scene , Ginger 's heavy swooping dress smacks Fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious . Fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless.Ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than Fred , since she had to do all the same moves , in step , and backwards ...

" This isn 't exactly a great film , but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different . The film 's main theme is fate and small , seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future . In some ways this reminds me of the film SLIDING DOORS , though instead of focusing on one random event , seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion . Plus , an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene--like he 's some sort of omnipotent being but there 's absolutely no explanation of him in the film ( like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY ) .The DVD jacket shows just Audrey Tautou . This is capitalize on her success in AMELIE , though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role . The pace is brisk , the acting fine and the conclusion isn 't bad at all . The only reason I didn 't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school shootings , this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea . Presented as a series of video recordings made by the two troubled men ( I cannot refer to persons who kill as boys or teens ) , the months of preparation leading to zero day ( the codename for the day on which they will attack ) the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun . It seems intent on portraying the pain they suffer , yet focuses on the literal preparation . The problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered . The only point at which emotion became overwhelming was the ending , as expected . But leading up to this point , it 's never really clear as to why they are planning this out . We are told the obligatory story that they were mocked , but the film also seems to contradict this . Without ruining the film , it 's easy to say it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions , but falls short because of sloppy film-making . All directing is amateur , to further the homemade video concept , but the story and continuity is weak . The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot , but also fails to provide the information for such an event . The ending is abrupt , and doesn 't feel like it finishes everything that the film began . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Although The Notorious Bettie Page is well acted and shot , is is , at best , a Cliffs Notes version of Bettie 's biography . The film mainly centers on her work with Irving and Paula Klaw , the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos . It does not detail her life after posing , aside from her religious rebirth . It cites " " The Real Bettie Page " , " by Richard Foster as a source , but it ignores Bettie 's later years of mental illness and incarceration in a mental hospital . The narrow focus of the biography can be debated , but the majority of Bettie 's fans and the " " civilians " " would probably be more interested in her modeling career , which is what they get.The film is well acted , with Gretchen Mol faithfully reproducing the look of Bettie , as well as conveying the sweetness that her photos exuded . The character is played as rather naive , a probable byproduct of interviews given by Bettie in recent years . It is more likely that Bettie was aware of the nature of her photos but rationalized it as acting and costumes.The supporting cast is also outstanding , with Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor playing Irving and Paula Klaw , and David Strathairn as Estes Kefauver . The film errs with the character of John Willie , played by Jared Harris . John Willie never met Bettie Page and was not involved in photo shoots with the Klaws . Harris plays Willie a bit like Peter O 'Toole , in his more debauched state.Despite the quality of acting , the film is a bit of a disappointment in terms of depth . The story is rather cursory and we never feel that we truly get to know Bettie . Much like her photos , it 's just an image . It does tend to exaggerate Bettie 's notoriety . Her photos were mainly seen in and around New York , in a very narrow market of underground and cultish publications . Her real fame came after her photos were reprinted in the late 70 's and 80 's , and the Cult of Betty Page ( as her name was usually spelled ) grew . Bettie 's greatest exposure ( pardon the pun ) was in Playboy , appearing in the January 1955 issue ( the Christmas photo , which is staged in reverse in the film ) .The film is well done , if rather shallow . It is able to sustain interest until the end and showcases many fine performances . It hits the high points of Bettie 's life , but ignores many details which would have given it far greater depth . The ending is rather a let down . It feels rather abrupt . Still , the movie is definitely worth viewing by anyone interested in Bettie , or even the time period . The soundtrack is great , really pulling the viewer into the 1950 's . If nothing else , the film stands as a showcase for America 's burgeoning sexuality and the clash with its Puritan past . It 's also a peek at an icon for both men and women . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles . I thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting .

" A very watchable film , and one which was eagerly awaited having seen the trailer a number of times.The whole thing looks superb , from the ludicrous efforts of the effete upper class to distance themselves from the mediocrity , to the lower class scum just trying to keep their heads above the filth , the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brilliantly.Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean extremely well , though the part does not exactly stretch him , and Robert Carlyle seems a little wasted on Plunkett , Miller 's highwayman colleague.The real star of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott , who plays Mr Chance ( a kind of 1740 's chief of police ) with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the cast.A great film , and anyone that enjoys the colour and style of Peter Greenaway 's films will love the look of this , although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours are up.Well worth a viewing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Sometime ago I watched a video of Paul Thomas Anderson in which he express the big interest that he has in porn films and how this industry could 've produce better films and in consequence a complete genre and not just sex in video tape . Paul Thomas Anderson put his own believes of porn industry in the character played in a terrific way by Burt Reynolds . His name is Jack Horner , a director whose biggest dream is to make a " " real " " film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and , at the same time , exciting with the beauty혚 and with the " " big cocks and tits " . " Soon as he meets Eddie Adams ( Mark Walhberg ) , he believes that he has found the new star for his films . And that 's how the story of the young Eddie in the porn industry begins.The film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the persons that will be part of Eddie 's life and later we can see them outside the porn industry , living their daily routine . But soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after only one party , the story of the new Eddie begins , the story of Dirk Diggler . All of them will taste the real success with Dirk as the main star , winning lots of prizes and helping Jack to make real his biggest dream with a series of films about Brock Landers , the new character of Dirk . This sort of exploitation films are an amazing success and for Jack are his firsts " " real " " films . But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the " " horrible 80 's " " when there is going to be $ ex , DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and pals . But we all know that the excesses can destroy any person and the erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses in their lives after the total success and how everybody is having a real bad time with many problems due to society 's bad look to porn industry and to a period with many excesses . In Dirk 's decadence , after trying and failing in the music industry , there 's a brilliant sequence that can resume in a perfect way how the things are going for Dirk and his friends . That sequence is the one of his first drug deal , with the appearance of Alfred Molina , which ends in a total mess . Is funny for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and pals but there 's always a solution if you get back in what you know and when Dirk is back , Brock is back.Well I haven 't mention most of the characters in my sort of a summary but I must say that all are amazingly well developed . The cast is just superb with the best performance that I have seen of Mark Walhberg . Julianne Moore has a powerful performance in a really moving character ; Reilly , Macy , Hoffman , Heather Graham , Guzman , etc are just memorable , all of their characters with funny and sad moments.Finally , I really love the amazing cinematic style of Anderson here with a unique view to the porn industry of the late 70 's and early 80 's . I used to say that " " Magnolia " " was my favourite of Anderson but right now , after watching all except " " Sidney " , " I can 't say that I have a favourite because I love them all ! PS : somewhere I read that this film is the " " Scorsese film " " of Anderson so I 'm more than sure that if you love " " Goodfellas " " and " " Casino " " you will love this one too . I f * cking love " " Boogie Nights " " ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Man 's Castle is a wonderful example of a Pre-Code film . It involves realistic events with truly enjoyable and imperfect characters . Spencer Tracy plays Bill , a free soul without a dime in his pocket . He makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings . One night , he meets Trina , a beauty by any standards who is cold and alone . She has refused to resort to prostitution so she has not eaten for several days , but the two take very well to each other and form a relationship . His free spirit tempts him to leave her , so life is rocky , but there is a true spark between the two , even if they live in a shack by the river.Tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen . His characters are amazing and relatable . We can see his thoughts on his face , making him easy to identify with , even if we believe he is behaving badly . Young is great in pre-code films . Her character is very sweet but far from perfect , making her all the more likable.Pre-code elements include skinny dipping , pregnancy before marriage , and crime . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" For me , this is another one of those films that I got to see off of the Los Angeles based " " Z " " Channel when it was in service . And it was another one of those movies that I saw when I was young ... and learned that there was a world out there ... one I did not want to accept.Moving to Los Angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date , no premiere channel programming has matched the " " Z " " Channel in its showing of international films . The three international films that stuck in my young head were " " Spetters " , " " " Beau Pere " " and of course this one , " " Pixote " . " This was the most shocking and saddest movie I ever witnessed in my life . This was also one of the first movies that made me understand that there IS a difference in cinema : to entertain , and to inform . Let me be honest .. growing up in a small town on the east coast , I had no idea anything like this -- to this extent -- existed . All I knew from South America was brochures of fabulous Brazillian vacations and that Columbia had a lot of drug trafficking.Then comes a film like Pixote . Sad . Disturbing . Unflinching . Scary . You 're watching : Children . Those that need shelter , love , understanding and all these get are a way to survive day after day through drugs , sex , robbing , stealing , sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group homes etc . Their survival is hard to watch with other street children , prostitutes , etc . , and you begin to wonder HOW can things like this be allowed to happen in this world.Pixote is not a film for entertainment , it is a film of information . It shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows life for these daily street children . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * I thought Pitch Black to be quite enjoyable , with some nice effects--I liked the larger beasts , although they aren 't a patch on the Aliens from the Alien series . It had quite a good atmosphere , which I felt Vin Diesel helped contribute toward.One thing which kind of stumped me was how it rained . If the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight , where did the moisture come from to form clouds and therefore rain ? I liked the fact that Fry died at the end--it reminded me of the New Hollywood films of the 1970s , with the main heroine not making it to the end . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was waiting to see this movie from a long time . It 's promos gave a fair idea about the content and when I finally saw it , I really find it was quite well made . Most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life . This is what this movie is all about the period when a newly wed couple Fardeen and Esha get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon . The acting is really spell binding though I think Esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself . The story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate . The editing and direction were also good , Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here . To summarize I would say it is a good drama cum romance , a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a clean entertainer . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I sort of liked this Columbo movie its atmosphere , which was real thriller like and its approach even at times reminded me of film-noir , in the movie its first 30 minutes or so . It 's really nice and done in a good old fashioned way , with the right camera angles and use of light . It doesn 't mean instantly that this movie is a brilliant one though but its solid enough to consider this a good late Columbo movie entry . It 's definitely a better movie than the average ' later ' Columbo movie entry.26 years after his previous Columbo movie appearance , George Hamilton returns once again to play the main lead opposite Peter Falk , again as the murderer , in a total different and new role of course . I liked him in his role and he was a good Columbo ' villain ' , who gave the good old Lieutenant some good competition . They had some nice sequences together . Problem with the ' modern ' new Columbo movies always sort of had been that it didn 't feature a good well known actor opposite Peter Falk . This movie obviously doesn 't suffer from this problem . But I must say though that this movie doesn 't feature Peter Falk at this best . He has certainly played the character better and his performance isn 't quite consistent enough within this movie , which is probably also due to he movie its director Daryl Duke , who also directed the really dreadful movie " " Tai-Pan " , " among many other projects.It has a rather good and enjoyable story but the fact that the same sort of plot to cover up the murder had been used before in an earlier Columbo movie also doesn 't help of course . It got used before in the 1975 movie " " Columbo : Playback " . " Nevertheless it of course also still has plenty enough ' original ' moments of its own with its story , even though of course in essence every Columbo movie is more or less the same . But oh well , that is what made the Columbo series so great and consistent . If it ain 't broke don 't fix it.It also is true that within this movie more clues than usual are left out for the Lieutenant , which doesn 't mean that the movie its murderer is more stupid or sloppy but I more see it as the writers being more overly enthusiastic than others . It doesn 't make the movie or story bad and it in fact perhaps even makes it more enjoyable , to see Columbo hard at work and discovering all kind of small but important clues . Luckily the movie is also filled with some enjoyable effective relieving Columbo-comedy.Simply a good late Columbo movie entry.7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yet another remake of " " Fistful of Dollars " , " Sergio Leone 's remake of Kurosawa 's " " Yojimbo " " ( suggested by the novel ' Red Harvest ' ) .This one is strictly a B-Movie ; taken as that , it is rather enjoyable. the direction is crisp , the acting full of verve , the limitations of its ' direct-to-video ' photography well-handled.The weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the ' fistful ' / ' yojimbo ' plot to a sub-plot from Leone 's ' Once Upon a Time in the West ' . Although leone directed both ' Fistful ' and ' West ' , his motivations behind the two films couldn 't be anymore different . The ' Man With No Name ' ( Eastwood ) is a borderline socio-path with a soft spot for broken families . Harmonica ( Chaeles Bronson ) is obsessed with his own broken family , and obsessed with revenge . These two characters would not have had much to do with each other . In order to bring them together , ' Gun Crazy ' has to twist it 's plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we 're actually following.But this is a B-Movie after all , and filled with action and silliness ; it 's entertaining on that level , just don 't expect anything more . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film ! The plot is somewhat lacking , but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference . This is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please . As a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining ; and with major stars like Cary Grant , Myrna Loy , and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you go wrong ? Comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued , and is very difficult to imitate . A good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film : The Money Pit , with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long . Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars , the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments . Achieving true comedic dialog is an art . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I absolutely LOVED this film ! I do not at all relate to all the other comments I have read about it . I was COMPLETELY enthralled through every second ! I found the story gripping , the acting intense , and the direction spot-on . I would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie . Even though there was nothing " " scary " " about the story itself , I was soundly on edge through the whole movie - and for the rest of my evening . I found that there were so many perfect choices made ... the casting , the script , the little bits of humor sprinkled in it .

The story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison , that looks much worse than Alcatraz . The children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman .

" Why oh why can 't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale ? This is the second adaptation of " " Beowulf " " I 've been disappointed with in a year . But I have to say , the previous version ( " " Beowulf & Grendel " , " starring Gerald Butler ) was far superior to this . That one was only a little disappointing . This one is a mess ! ! ! What bugged me most ? Was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason ( Human sacrifices ? Pointless love interest ? ) , or the bad CGI , or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting ? Even worse was the way they made beautiful Marina Sirtis look so horrible ! ! ! And lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow ? And why did they continually remind us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men , and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film . He was tossed around by both monsters he fought , relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon . Even when he slugged the arrogant prince , he didn 't knock him out . He was much too reliant on weapons . Beo-wimp is more like it . This was certainly not the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem ! I 'd like to end this on a positive note but I can 't really think of one offhand . All I can say is , if you 've ever read " " Beowulf " , " you 'll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal , inaccurate excuse for an adaptation ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" It was on a day in 1891 when Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson surprised his boss , Thomas Alva Edison with his remarkable work in the development of motion pictures . After many experiments , Dickson was now able to capture scenes of real life with his camera , and reproduce them through his invention , the Kinetoscope , as if a fragment of time were preserved in celluloid . Soon , Dickson 's Kinetoscope would become an enormous success as a new way of entertainment , with many people eager to pay the nickel that was charged to be able to watch people dancing , or acrobats performing stunts through the " " peepshow " " of the Kinetoscope . However , the invention wasn 't complete , in order for it to capture on film the real life as we know it , sound was needed on the movies . So Dickson kept experimenting and this short experiment , Kinetophone 's first film , was the result.In this experiment , codenamed simply as " " Dickson Experimental Sound Film " , " director William K.L. Dickson stands in front of a recording cone for a wax cylinder ( earliest method of recording sound ) , with his violin on hands , playing a song named " " Song of the Cabin Boy " . " The idea was to record the song into the cylinder at the same time that the camera was recording his movements . In order to show that this was a motion picture , two of Edison 's " " Black Maria " " laboratory decided to do a little dance in front of the camera . Unlike what author Vito Russo claimed in his book , " " The Celluloid Closet " , " this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality as it obviously is a reference to the environment of loneliness of the lab , akin to the lonely sailors to whom the " " Song of the Cabin Boy " " was dedicated to ( the title Russo suggests , " " The Gay Brothers " , " is actually anachronistic as " " gay " " had no homosexual connotation in the late 1890s ) .Sadly , Dickson was unable to achieve the desired effect , and the Kinetophone never could really produce the synchronized audio with images . While he had the cylinder with the sound and the celluloid with the images , the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective , and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Louis Lumi챔re 's Cin챕matographe prompted Edison 's team to focus on projecting systems and eventually Dickson left the company . Fortunately , in 1998 Dickson 's cylinder with the movie 's sound was rebuilt and film editor Walter Murch made a restoration of the experiment as it was intended . Finally , " " Dickson Experimental Sound Film " " could be heard with synchronized sound , just as its creative inventor had intended . While it was not a successful attempt , this outstanding film is a testament of the enormous genius of the father of Kinetoscope . 8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary . The musical score , cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an Imax production . Even though it is shot for those huge Imax theaters , it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system . In fact this would make a perfect DVD to demo your system.The subject is also so fascinating . It is about Mario Andretti and his son Michael . I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the CART Championship , F1 Championship , The Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 . The script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son . The first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that Mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection . The other car is Michael 's new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season . Imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating.Paul Newman , who was Michael Amoretti 's team owner at the time this movie was made , narrates the film . His anecdotes and witticism , drawn from many years as an owner and driver , lends much to the production.The main feature is the race scenes . Turn up the volume here ! There is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget . Wow ! The final magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family . This god of the racing world , Mario Andretti , is loving father who proudly watches over his son 's career . They work together so well that every father and son should see this . You can tell that they are a close family . I wish we could all have that experience . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This late 50s French study of disaffected youth ( in their early 20 's , actually-- " " grown up " , " but not yet settled down into the adult world ) probably missed the mark by a mile in terms of being an accurate depiction of 1958 French youth ( don 't virtually ALL youth films made by adults do this ? The ones that don 't--River 's Edge comes to mind-- are rare indeed ) , but director-writer Marcel Carne , of Les Enfants du Paradis fame , is too accurate an observer of humanity to NOT provide an insightful view of the essence of these characters . In a sense , the details are not important--you could change the details and set this film today and it would work just as well--but the loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and self-righteous anger of the characters is captured well . The young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo are in supporting roles , but leads Jacques Charrier , Laurent Terzieff , Pascale Petit , and Andrea Parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth . There is also a fine jazz score , which you can get on the CD JAZZ IN PARIS--JAZZ & CINEMA VOL . 2 . Unlike some who have commented on the film , I don 't really see director-writer Carne as sitting in judgment on these characters--he seems as though he is an objective observer to me . Of course , these middle-class characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have nothing to whine about to some working-class viewers of the film , and I think Carne is certainly aware of this . For this American viewer ( I watched a dubbed , fairly literally I 'd say , version of this titled THE CHEATERS ) , the film provides an interesting window into the France of the 1950s . It also is self-consciously poetic ( the scene on the ledge , saving the cat , is but one example of this ) and has intellectual aspirations in that charming way that only French films can get away with--I can imagine the heavy-handed , melodramatic , shallow way this kind of material would have been handled by an American studio production , and the sensationalistic , moralistic , suggestive way this kind of material would have been handled by American drive-in / exploitation filmmakers . I feel that Marcel Carne has captured the essence of that period between , say , high school graduation and when , by one 's early 30s , people have largely settled into a routine , whatever that routine may be . Those willing to watch the film with an open mind and not fire away at the many easy targets it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties . And even if you don 't want to do that , you can go in the other room while the film is playing and simply enjoy the fine soundtrack , with great 50s jazz and instrumental pop , including the wonderful original score by an American " " Jazz at the Philharmonic " " group including Coleman Hawkins , Dizzy Gillespie , Stan Getz ( spelled " " goetz " " in the credits ) , Roy Eldridge , and Ray Brown . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" 12 / 17 / 01 All I can do with this film is improvise on my impressions . I wasn 't given the " " changes , " " don 't know the " " score , " " and am not schooled in the genre . I always had problems following chord changes anyway ( trumpet player , y 'know ) , so I was pretty well limited to doing the basic " " keep the tune in mind " " and ad lib around that . What jammed me up about this incredibly moody black and white blues piece was the knot it gave me in my head and heart in trying to figure out whether to go with the ensemble or pick out a path along the tune ( story . ) I guess I went with the tune as usual ; I kept getting lost on the changes--too deep , extensive , over my head , probably . Still , it was a gas to try to keep pace . I admired the actors ' playing to the theme and story line . I didn 't see some things or heare things others seem to : I didn 't feel the light skin gal was " " trying to pass " " as much as she was either oblivious to the color issue or was trying to ignore it--at first : later she came back fighting . The brooding light skin young man ( his trumpet noodling mas ludicrous ) was ambiguous , ambivalent , and --perhaps his best feature--remote . What , I thought after the shadow-curtain closed on this provocative piece--is the foundation of a thing like this ? Is it a way of finding " " reality " " by setting up a stage , peopling it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and theme ? Is it any more real or truthful than a well-crafted script--without the benefit of editing and revising ? Is improvisation heroic , " " artier " " ? --moreso than crafted work ? Where is there greater or clearer truth : in retrospective art / craft or in fabrication and reformation ? Well , I am still lost in this question . I loved the film ; it got me lost in a cool blue foggy evening , where I just had to go home and get out my horn . Guess what ? I broke out in a twelve-bar blues riff , tried and true--couldn 't make myself stray from the tune . Reality is just too scary. jaime says give them a 7 and more .

" For a long time I did not know weather I liked this film or not . This is surprising , because I usually do know , but because the film did not go anywhere , I was a bit confused.Two people move into a somewhat communal household setting . Finding their spouses constantly working or away on business trips , their attention , out of sheer loneliness , wanders to each other . After a platonic love affair , the male lead played by Tony Leung Chiu discloses that he has a mistress on the side . Su Li-Zehn , played by Maggie Cheung is hurt , even though their love affair has not been physically consummated . Chiu leaves the country , only to come back years later , when everything has changed.For the cynic 's part , the film is correct . By never actively or actually touching the part of love , but only approaching it , the film , admittedly says more than so many others have on the subject . It is also true , I think , that nothing good could have come if they did go on to have the affair . At least that 's the feeling I get.If we are to believe it , however , when Garica Marquez writes that " ... " love is a state of grace ; not the means to anything but the alpha and the omega , an end in itself , " " then this film falls miserably short of this , as do all others . Or , if you are inclined to entirely incomplete minimalism , hits it right on the mark . What films in history have achieved , approached , or sustained this phrase , if for only a short while ? My honest feeling in memory is that about two . When Harry Met Sally suggests effectively this romantic perfection ; and the getting is all in just getting there . It is interesting that in When Harry Met Sally , this is done in the course of wooing , rather than in its attainment . Can 't anyone say anything good about love after it has been achieved by two individuals ? Nicholas Spark 's recent film The Notebook comes closer to this perhaps than any other film ; are we to believe that once love is achieved it flies of the radar only to exist in perfection in some other dimension , or , more true perhaps , becomes latent vehicle for other ends ? In the Mood for Love is an honest film , with gorgeous and generous cinematography worthy in all respects of the best that Almodovar has to offer , yet all it manages to say in the end is that " " Life is sometimes like this . " " Now this is by no means a diffident thing to say , especially if said well , but the problem really comes at the end of the last act when Kar Wai Wong tries to round out the film by relating , only for the second time , a broader historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship which has just taken place . This is a worthy effort , and the variation on the musical motif played throughout the film is rather brilliant , but the theme 's relatively spare indictment plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the holistically inclined audience , leaving the viewer to split the difference , a mistake in any film . A director should know where he is going , and how to get there . But in all honesty , it is only one wrong turn . However , as anyone knows , all it takes is one notable imperfection to spoil the perfect barrel of honey.The effort , though , is definitely worth while ; trying to let a historical theme broaden and round out the film and raise it beyond the micro-meaning of the couple , but without any real foreshadowing , it is the crucial mistake . In a word , and unfortunately , it is too little too late . It is also , I think , too much of a challenge for the non-Asian viewer not familiar enough with China 's history to appreciate completely this sweeping stroke . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This series has recently been unearthed and excerpts can be seen , at least within Britain , via http : / / www.screenonline.org.uk / tv / id / 527213 / index.html Presumably there is some hope that the series may eventually become available more widely . The problem is that this series was followed by the series THE WARS OF THE ROSES that had a similarly stellar cast and which has been available to cable TV , or at least crowding the market . The two series are quite different in dramaturgy ; THE WARS consolidates the plays through extensive rewriting and shifting of scenes ; AN AGE OF KINGS follows Shakespeare more closely .

" While movie titles contains the word ' Mother ' , the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother 's love for her children.However , The Mother tells a different story.The Mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child , or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child . Here , Notting Hill director Roger Michell tells us how a mother 's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her.Before Daniel Craig takes on the role of James Bond , here , he plays Darren , a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother , and sleeping with her daughter as well . Anne Reid , who was a familiar face on TV series , takes up the challenging role of the leading character , May.The story begins with May coping with the sudden loss of her husband , Toots , in a family visit to her son , Bobby . While she befriends Darren , a handyman who is doing some renovation in Bobby 's house , she was shocked to found out that her daughter , Paula , was sleeping with Darren . At the same time , May was coping with life after the death of Toots . Fearing that Harry and Paula do not wanted her , May starts to find her life going off track , until she spends her afternoon with Darren.Darren was nice and friendly to May , and May soon finds some affection on Darren . Instead of treating him like a friend , she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple . Later , May found sexual pleasure from Darren , where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else . And this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family.The Mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life , and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on . This can be told from May buying tea time snacks for Darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her , where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for.Anne Reid has made a breakthrough for her role of May , as she was previously best well known for her various role on TV series . As she do not have much movies in her career resume , The Mother has put her on the critic 's attention . Daniel Craig , on the other hand , had took on a similar role in his movie career , such as Sylvia ( 2003 ) and Enduring Love ( 2004 ) . If his reprising role of James Bond fails , film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career , and The Mother is one of them.The Mother may not be everyone 's favorite , but it is definitely not your usual matin챕e show to go along with tea and scones , accompanied by butter and jam . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is apparently the first film featuring Gloria Swanson--the film that made her a breakout star . While she was good in the film , I can 't see how this performance in particular was so noteworthy at the time--but , still it was a very good film.Gloria plays the wife of a rich slob that continually takes her for granted . He cares little for his grooming , eats onions and forgets their anniversary ! And , at the same time , a Lothario comes into their lives and begins paying a lot of attention to Gloria and her dippy husband doesn 't even notice or give her any reason NOT to cheat on him . Ultimately , she divorces her hubby and marries the smooth-talking Romeo . However , while the movie could have just been an overdone melodrama ( they were pretty common at the time ) , it takes some interesting twists and turns and is an imaginative and fun film . While not the greatest silent film I have seen , it is a standout and deserves to be remembered.By the way , the DVD release from Image Entertainment is surprisingly good--with a decent print and music . This hasn 't always been true of other Image releases ( particularly how sloppily they handled the Chaplin releases ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have been waiting to see this film for ages and I finally have ! As soon as I heard the title I knew that this film would be my favourite film ever and when I saw it believe me I wasn 't disappointed ! This film had everything dance , love and Patrick Swayze ! There was so much in it and it dealt with important issues , ( that were at the time , 1960 's ) , such as abortion.The dancing in this film was fantastic , just like the acting was ! Swayze was brilliant just like Grey was too ! Although this film was absolutely fantastic you cannot say that you have seen it if you haven 't seen the last scene . It really does take your breath away as the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly , it had you dancing at the end of the film and it really wouldn 't surprise me if it influenced people to take up dancing ! Overall Dirty Dancing is a film NOT to be missed and even if half the actors are in the : " " Where are they now ? " " period the actors will always have this superb film in their career ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" A young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as Lady Macbeth thanks to the mishap of the production 's diva falling in front of a moving car . A success winning her accolades , Betty ( Christina Marsillach ) finds instead horror as the one responsible for getting her to this point terrorizes her in cruel ways.First her stage manager boyfriend , Stefano ( William McNamara ) is viciously stabbed with a knife while she has to watch , rope-tied to a pillar in his uncle 's vast mansion , keeping her eyes from closing thanks to needles scotch-taped under her eyes , with pricking a result if she blinks . Allowing her to escape , Betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position , when a specific gold chain is found on her Lady Macbeth wardrobe that had been torn to shreds by the madman after killing a series of crows which escaped from their cage in the equipment room , by the clothing designer who is first knocked to the floor by an iron and subsequently stabbed heinously by a pair of scissors ( .. to cap off this nasty scene , the chain falls into her throat with the killer having to cut open her throat to find it ; while not specifically elaborating this act , Dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors for optimum effect with the camera often retreating back to the victim 's dead face ) . Having nowhere to turn , Inspector Alan Santini ( Urbano Barberini , playing him cold and bland at Dario 's request ) promises to catch the psycho as Betty relies on her few remaining friends for comfort , the theater director Marco ( Ian Charleson , of GHANDI & CHARIOTS OF FIRE who would later die of AIDS ; A sad footnote , Dario revealed in an interview that Charleson informed him at the end of the shoot that he was HIV positive ) attempting the stage after a successful horror movie career despite being rejected by critics , and pal Mira ( Daria Nicolodi , Dario 's former squeeze ) , her agent and confident . But , the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will , of course , occur in the theater as Marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal.I think this is Dario at his most savage & nihilistic . Although he has certainly made later gruesome films ( .. such as his Masters of Horror entries and SLEEPLESS would suggest ) , this film really ups the ante in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath . His method of forcing Betty to watch was admittedly a gag by Dario regarding the type of audience who like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies . I found myself rubbing my eyes every time she just has to blink ( .. brilliantly , Dario shoots the pricking from point-of-view achieving a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the scotch taped needles holding our eyes open ) . I like how Dario will show the widened eyes of Betty , horrified at what she 's being forced into watching , as little blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but blink . The photographic work of Ronnie Taylor is impeccable , such as the crow 's point-of-view shot in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer . Or , when the camera " " travels " " through rooms in the theater following the killer who wishes to see his muse from a box seat . Or , the dream sequence where we are taken into Betty 's memory of an event regarding her mother 's death by a certain killer , donning the same mask and gloves as the one causing her trauma at present . The highlight , in my opinion , is the peephole bullet-fire sequence , masterly staged by all involved as the camera follows a bullet which shoots through the eye of a victim , exploding from the back of her head , going through a telephone Betty planned to use to call for help . We even get a crow pecking the eyeball from the killer ( .. to add to this vicious scene , the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling around in it 's beak ) . Only aspect I didn 't care for , often pointed out by naysayers of the film , is the " " final " " ending which I personally felt was a bit unnecessary , but I guess Dario wanted to point out that Betty was indeed not like her mother , a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies which , in a twist , relate to why the killer torments our heroine . The rock music used during the violent scenes didn 't bother me , because I felt that those moments of wicked graphic attacks needed a jarring thud which heavy metal can often provide . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you Listen to Ween ( The Pod , God / Satan ) , then you know what 's going on with " " Split " " I found that watching the film under the influence of LSD helped to deal with Audio / Video tracers from fantastic editing job .

Don 't bother writing about something out of your comprehension 's reach ... There just isn 't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it 's most raw , amateur level . I dare anyone to make a movie that can equally Mess with my head and change the way I look at visual arts and the world 's reality .

Such a courageous , wise , funny and talented spirit ! And what a Crew ! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City , to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in Louisiana , the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon , the excitement of rafting through some rapids , the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi , and the phone calls home , and as always - boys will be boys . This film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike . Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage . And the Crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation .

" The progression of the plot is enough to " " rope one in " " and create curiosity about the outcome .

" There is nothing original , humane or insightful in this film . The acting is average , images are amateurish , the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic ... something close to a soap.In 2 : 37 , a suicide is used to turn the film into a suspense drama . We watch , partly , because we want to know who dies . The various characters each have a problem , and the film shows how bad each problem is for them , but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves . Despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key events , there is NEVER another way of seeing the events themselves . So in 2 : 37 , the arseholes are arseholes , the angels are angels . This is simple stuff.Without this complexity , the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence . You hardly get to know the kids as much as the breasts , bodies and limps that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation.In the end , if you know ANYTHING about film in the last 5 years , 2 : 37 is just an immature rip off of Elephant - not a meditation , not a progression . Yet while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy , they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant . The positive posts on IMDb curiously avoid any mention of this , or simply don 't value originality . If you do want something with heart and voice - avoid this piece of youth exploitation . I was surprised by the filmmakers age when I found out after seeing this film - I had assumed a 13 year old had made it . The Twenty Somethings I 've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Shore Leave " " is mostly an average Star Trek adventure . Nothing wrong with the episode , though . I simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans . It is lightweight entertaining , nothing more . However , I 'm glad to see that a TV show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts . In this episode , Kirk decides to grant his crew some time off , and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation . As usual , the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be . There are some action and tense moments , but most of the story is played for laughs .

" When Pinky , a qualified electrician , is released from prison , his parole officer has found him a job working at a big city bank . When some of the crime underworld from his past learn of his position they plan to exploit it and rob the bank . Pinky is at first horrified because he really wants to go straight , but when a twist of fate happens Pinky begins to think one shouldn 't look a gift horse in the mouth.Also known as The Mayfair Bank Caper { amongst others ! } , this is a hugely enjoyable piece that is quintessential 1970s . London and all it 's highly dubious fashions are lit up like a Christmas tree in Ralph Thomas and Guy Elmes ' cunningly crafty caper . If the viewer can accept David Niven as an aged crime lord of some evility { it 's not easy i can tell you } , then A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square could well surprise you . The actors aren 't pulling up any trees for sure , but it 's really not hurting the picture at all , it has an honest fun quality that is never less than entertaining . The score and soundtrack is perhaps guilty of over jollification during the dramatic criminal moments , but it 's a minor complaint to leave me thinking this is an under seen British gem.Richard Jordan takes the lead role of Pinky ( obviously hoping to lure in American viewers } , 70s heart throb Oliver Tobias { a mass of hair } is in there to keep the ladies interested , whilst the blokes get the pleasurable sight of Elke Sommer and her delightful legs for company . Moving along at a decent enough clip and containing a seriously rewarding finale , A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square deserves far better than the paltry 5.7 rating here on IMDb , but just how many people have seen it i wonder ? , hmm , go on give it a go if you the chance , it 's good stuff . 7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There were heist movies before this one , and indeed the likes of Rififi were an obvious influence on it - but The Red Circle is more than just another entry in an overpopulated genre and with this film , director Jean-Pierre Melville has managed to create something that both thrills on the surface and gives its audience something to think about . Being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters , and Melville delivers that with this film in droves ; the tone of the film is very relaxed too and Melville allows the bulk of the film to bubble under the cool exterior . The story has a number of angles but the central character is Corey - a thief who is released from prison . His release coincides with the escape of infamous murderer Vogel , who slips from under the nose of Police Commissioner Mattei during a train ride . The first thing Corey does upon release is steal some money from his former boss Rico , and the second thing he does is recruit Vogel and a sharpshooter to help him pull of a jewel heist . But Rico and the police are hot on the thieves ' tails ... The film is bolted together by four excellent central performances . Alain Delon is calm and calculating as the film 's anti-hero , while Gian Maria Volont챔 looks formidable in his role as the escaped murderer . Fran챌ois P챕rier is good also as a dubious club owner , while the real standout performance comes from Andr챕 Bourvil in his role as the police commissioner . The film runs at almost two and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill ride . However , the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements . The film does feature crime film stapes such as shootings , but they are kept to a minimum . The first two thirds of the movie are really just building up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the end . Rififi was most famous for its heist sequence - an intricately designed scene in which nobody speaks a word . The heist in this film is similar in that it is also wordless , and I have to say that I preferred the scene in Rififi ; but Melville 's skill in direction and the calm and composed way that it plays out make good of it . The film boils down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely . Overall , this might not appeal to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow ; but The Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" THE BLOB is a great horror movie , not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable , flesh-dissolving title character , but because it features a real societal message . It is , in many ways , a " " feel-good horror film . " " The clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast . The two romantic leads , Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut , bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings . They are misunderstood but very well-meaning young people , and it 's very easy to root for them.This is a pro-society movie , and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom , not out of some malevolent character flaw . Steve McQueen 's drag-racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings , but quickly joins in McQueen 's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees McQueen 's seriousness . In this way , a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism.The authorities ' initial skepticism of the kids ' wild claims is proved wrong--and once the threat is acknowledged by all , all conflict within the society disappears . This unification of purpose , and the validation of the " " troublemaking " " teens , becomes official when Aneta Corsaut 's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob . On any other day , breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent--on this particular day , it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure . At this turning point , it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old.This is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a " " generation gap " " but suggests that it is more imaginary than real , and that given a real crisis , people will naturally band together to restore order . " " The Blob " " is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of " " Night of the Living Dead " " ( 1968 ) .Much has been made of the film 's cheap but innovative ( and effective ! ) visual effects . They are undeniably clever . A lot of the gravity-defying tricks we see the Blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated . The camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly " " locked down " " position ( the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that ) . These scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned--the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up . In a way , this was similar to stop motion photography , but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet . Even today , the effects are startling and bizarre.A very good film with an exploitative-sounding title , THE BLOB is a must-see . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Gundam Wing to me happens to be a good anime . A bit slow moving ( especially around the middle of the series ) , but over all enjoyable .

" I would probably say this was on a par with films like " " Devil 's Rain " " and that sort of film , although this is probably a bit better made . I love 70 's horror and this has most of the elements that make up other movies I like so it was pretty easy to enjoy . A family on their vacation stumble across a small town where the people seem to be gripped by some sort of hysteria . Seems like the children have been disappearing . After an initial attempt to flee this place , the family is somehow stopped on the edge of town and find their way back , but not without first finding a house where the kids are gone and mommy and daddy are dead . Seems like we have a different kind of twist on a senior citizen community center in this town , they 're all Satan worshipers and they need the kids to renew their lives so they can continue on in their service , I guess . Not that anyone seems too keen on giving up their kids for this enterprise . This is fairly classy considering that it 's scary and creepy without buckets of gore or the loud startling events that try to make people jump in films today , which seem to have replaced actual scares . We have Hank Kimball ( Alvy Moore ) from " " Green Acres " " as Tobey , a sheriff 's deputy that reads UFO magazines , and LQ Jones as the sheriff , and a very familiar character actor as the dad of the stranded family . And Strother Martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty unbeknown to his fellow townsfolk . This is pretty good stuff but a tad on the confusing side sometimes , but overall works pretty well & is recommended for fans of 70 's horror . 8 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Having been familiar with Hartley 's " " The Go-Between " " for a good while , both in its original book form and in its disappointing Pinter-Losey film adaptation , this was interesting stuff . " " The Hireling " " proves almost a mirror image at times ; set in a slightly less distant period for the main part , featuring exposure of the British Class System , and containing a set piece sports match ( boxing takes the place of cricket ) that reveals rather a lot about .This refreshes in its small-scale , character focus . You do not exactly get to ' know ' Lady Franklin and Leadbitter in the novelistic sense , but this distance is appropriately played out in telling body language and inflection from the actors . Your distance from ever fully sympathizing with any one true character mirrors the dormant ' difference ' that so dooms the central relationship . Miles and Shaw are wonderfully subtle , and we see more in their ' less ' ; never once are these actorly , showy performances . They are fittingly Stanislavskian interpretations that create the impression of these characters having life outsides the confines of the film . All other parts are very satisfactorily handled , though they are far smaller in this film than I presume in the novel and compared indeed to " " The Go-Between " , " a stunning work about disillusionment . The disillusion at the centre of this film is so sadly and movingly conveyed in the late scenes where Shaw kisses Miles and is rejected , and then where a drunken Leadbitter confronts Cantrip and Lady Franklin . It 's a howling shame that what would have been an incredibly poignant ending of spoiled , desolate lives at either side of the screen , is ' embellished ' with a decidedly odd little coda . One is entirely bemused by the jump in tone , as Shaw 's Leadbitter goes beserk and ironically sings " " Rule Britannia " " and " " God Save the Queen " " as he crashes his car into things . The political point is heavily over-egged by this bombastic , rather dingily operatic ending . All sense of subtlety , so effectively conveyed hitherto , is lost , as the implicit point is heavily and noisily made . Agit-prop surely has no place in this sort of delicate period drama.Overall , however , one cannot be too harsh . While this absurd end-piece is a major flaw , the rest of the film must be praised as a sensitive , evocative film , of sadness and detailed observation about the way British society was in the past . Hartley 's languid but crystal-clear touch is very much in evidence throughout . It 's just a shame that we don 't end on the shattering conclusion to Shaw 's drunk scene . The tragic , deluded figure of Sarah Miles ' Lady Franklin is abruptly denied her place at the epicenter of the film , as the excellent human drama bizarrely slips into the realms of political point scoring . Shaw also - that most dry and yet deeply feeling of actors - is betrayed by the out-of-character excess that closes the film . Thus ; a fine , small-scale triumph is sabotaged ; but we ought to remember the many good points.Rating : - * * * 1 / 2 / * * * * * , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I loved this movie . To be very fair , the movie starts off very slowly , with none of the characters being terribly sympathetic .

What the first half of the movie lacks in character development and / or sympathy is adequately compensated for in the second half . It 's a bit like riding a roller coaster - a slow , uphill climb to strat off with , and then speed , twists and turns , and a few surprises.As usual , Meryl Streep is wonderful .

" I saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years . Needless to say , the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic . But still , Alec Guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly , if formulaic , romp through industrial post-WWII England.This is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product . Remember the car that runs on water ? Remember the promise of nuclear energy ? In this case , it 's a fabric that doesn 't wear out , wrinkle , or even get dirty ! Of course , fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business , and so the plot gets a bit thick.Guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile , and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast ! ( Those Brits ... always the stiff upper lip when under fire . ) The film might chug along exactly like Guiness 's goofy invention , but it 's a good ride all the same . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie has some things that are pretty amazing . First , it is supposed to be based on a true story . That , in itself , is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall-in Nebraska . I wonder if the real town 's name was close to " " Blainsworth " " ( which is the town 's name in the movie ) . There is an Ainsworth , Nebraska , but there is also a town that starts with Blains-something.It does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house . On the other hand , the scene where the TV goes fuzzy is based in fact . Before Doppler radar and weather radio , we were taught that if you turned your TV to a particular channel ( not on cable ) and tuned the brightness just right , you could tell if there was a tornado coming . The problem was that by then you would be able to hear it . Since I know something about midwest tornadoes , it made this movie fun for me . I enjoy it more than Twister .

She gave a superb performance , really one of her best , in ' Sophie 's Decision ' and I lapped her up in ' Out of Africa ' . That these two actors came together over 20 years ago for ' Kramer vs Kramer ' was definitely a very good idea : the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today 's society.On divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time , though the kids seem to suffer most혚혚혚 .. Beautifully handled by Robert Benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes : even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast ! And as for the breakfast scene with Billy ( Justin Henry ) , just simply magnificent . Just how do you get an eight-year-old to act ? Benton managed it , and of course with Hoffman there seemed to be good electricity : the result is certainly engaging , endearing , and convincing . Justin Henry 's performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids ' performances of all time . The best thing , once again , was the naturalness , there was no going over the top , so frequent these days.This film came up again on the small screen the other night , though I have had it in my video collection for years : it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything . Around 7쩍 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Peter Strauss , by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films , often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - Usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film , having channel-hopped into it half-way through . Well , I 've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about The Jericho Mile - That should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film ! ! Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much .... Looking to be objective , I attempted to criticise this film . Instead , I found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit-picks . This is what true , realistic film-making is about . This is not your typical Hollywood sensationalism , where everything is overacted - It 's so realistic and true to life that people have thought it 's based on a real event ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" We often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics , but I still recommend " " City Hall " . " In a role he was born to play , Al Pacino stars as New York 's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy . But it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect . In this movie , the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal . No matter how much you trust any given politician , you may have your doubts after watching this movie.I understand that I can 't name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays , but that 's not the point . If we had idealistic impressions of those at the top , this movie tears such ideas down . Certainly one that I encourage you to see .

" I appreciated the photography , the textures , the colours and often , unlike one comment , the lighting . What was lacking for me was a coherent storyline.I found it often disjointed , badly edited and at times difficult to follow . My version was 110 minutes , IMDb shows one at 125m . Possibly the cuts and subtitles didn 't help . I applaud any films that escape from the Hollywood mould but this left me disappointed . Miss Gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine , I just wanted a little more dialogue . If anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one , try ' Hideous Kinky 'with Kate Winslet . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I thought this was an utterly charming film . The story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters : Pecker 's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places . Edward Furlong does well in the lead , but the best performances are by his grandmother , Mink Stole ( a hilarious cameo ) and , of all people , Patty Hearst . I think the reviewers are way off base on this one . They seem to be taking Pecker 's worst valuation of his work as gospel , when I think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is an awesome movie , and if you haven 't seen it , you should go to the video store right now and rent it . First off , the cast is superb . Not only does it have current stars , like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton , but it also has your stars of yesteryear like Judge Reinhold . It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jon Bon Jovi , Ted Danson , and Jamie Lee Curtis . Second off , the story was quite good also . It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie , and almost made it dramatic . It takes the drug situation in the United States , and instead of giving it a comedic face like in " " Half Baked " " it has a true , life lesson image like " " Traffic " . " So watch this movie , if you 're a stoner it will give you insight into something you love , if you don 't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This 1991 NBC-TV movie aired six months before John Goodman 's big-screen version of the life of Babe Ruth came out . For my money , there is no comparison between the two . The TV production isn 't perfect but it presents the Babe 's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman 's one-dimensional telling . I especially enjoyed the film 's depiction of the complex love-hate relationship Ruth had with Yankee manager Miller Huggins , who always understood his star player 's brilliance and also kept trying to point out why Ruth 's own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players . The TV-movie rightly notes how Ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the Yankees because of his flaws , while the horrible Goodman version tries to push the falsehood that Ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking.This film makes a great companion piece to " " Eight Men Out " " since the story starts with Ruth 's arrival in New York in 1920 , one year after the Black Sox Scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin . Indeed , the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with John Anderson reprising his " " Eight Men Out " " role as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's hard to find an outright bad historical drama that 's based on the life of any number of British monarchs . Just take a well respected British or Australian actor , make things look pretty , and you 're guaranteed a formula for Oscar success.The Young Victoria is no exception , getting just about everything right , the cinematography striking and beautiful , with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics . Starring Emily Blunt in a role she can finally soar in , the film begins with Victoria 's 18th birthday and moves through the intrigue and issues that surrounded her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert ( Rupert Friend ) . As the young Victoria herself laments , she 's moved like a chess pawn by a variety of parties as she finds her footing and her voice as one of Britain 's most influential rulers.While this moving around the chess board is fairly typical territory , it is the development of Victoria 's relationship with Albert that makes the film slightly more interesting . I confess : I have a degree in history with a specialization in the Victorian era , so I 'm a bit attached to these figures . Despite their many flaws as rulers , Victoria and Albert were some of the first leaders devoted to improving civilization for their people . They left their legacy in the arts , in public health and education , and in Victoria 's conservative views and mourning culture after Albert 's death . But these things are only briefly hinted at during the film.It is fairly well established that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love , but held a level of respect for each other not usually seen between monarchs in arranged marriages . Even if it did occur behind the scenes , their 's was certainly one of the best known . Blunt and and Friend have just the right type of chemistry to do the famous pair justice , the proper mix of restraint and desperation . It 's a different love , not usually shown on screen , especially in this sort of film . It 's encouraging to finally see a relationship in which man and woman are on a equal playing field.But we don 't get to see that love enough . While the filmmakers try to fit the affair amongst the political trappings , it doesn 't quite build up the sort of momentum needed to keep the tension high . Also , without delving into the more advanced important public work of the pair , things feel a bit in limbo , superficial instead of intimate , and sometimes confusing . It 's not as big an issue during the film , but afterward , the effects wear off rather quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you just watched , despite the perfect performances by the leads , most noticeably Blunt who even captures the famous monarch 's expressions.For as much as it tries , Victoria succeeds on many levels but lacks that certain sparkle that would take it from solid to classic . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My kids recently started watching the reruns of this show - both the early episodes on the N , and the later ones on ABC Family - and they love it . ( I wasn 't aware the show had even lasted past the first or second season ) I 'm curious as to what prompted all of the cast changes - I 've seen them described as " " highly publicized , " " and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes . ( Personally , I don 't see a whole lot of difference - the scripts and themes remain largely the same throughout - but they do lose some great people along the way ) My daughter has put the DVDs on her wish list , so perhaps the land of special features and commentary will shed some light on all of this . I also wish they 'd done some self-referential humor about the changes - like on " " Boy Meets World " " where they drop the little sister for an entire season or so , and when a different actor later shows up playing her , they ask her where she 's been and she says " " upstairs , " " or when early series token geek " " Minkus " " shows up for the high school graduation , they ask him where he 's been and he says " " over there , " " pointing to the part of the classroom never shown by the camera , before saying " " Hey , Mr. Turner , wait up ! " " and running off screen ( Mr. turner being another character who left ) Oh well - maybe there will be an E true Hollywood story on this or something ? I was just glad to see Aunt Hilda show up for the finale - she was always one of my favorites - it 's too bad it couldn 't have been a more encompassing cast reunion .

" Los Angeles TV news reporter Jennifer ( the beautiful Barbara Bach of " " The Spy Who Loved Me " " fame ) and her two assistants Karen ( the appealingly spunky Karen Lamm ) and Vicki ( the pretty Lois Young , who not only gets killed first , but also bares her yummy bod in a tasty gratuitous nude bath scene ) go to Solvang , California to cover an annual Danish festival . Since all the local hotels are booked solid , the three lovely ladies are forced to seek room and board at a swanky , but foreboding remote mansion owned by freaky Ernest Keller ( deliciously played to geeky perfection by the late , great Sydney Lassick ) and his meek sister Virginia ( a solid Lelia Goldoni ) . Unfortunately , Keller has one very nasty and lethal dark family secret residing in his dank basement : a portly , pathetic , diapered , incest-spawned man-child Mongoloid named Junior ( an alternately touching and terrifying portrayal by Stephen Furst ; Flounder in " " Animal House " " ) , who naturally gets loose and wreaks some murderous havoc . Capably directed by Danny Steinmann , with uniformly fine acting from a sturdy cast , a compellingly perverse plot , excellent make-up by Craig Reardon , a nicely creepy atmosphere , a wonderfully wild climax , a slow , but steady pace , likable well-drawn characters , and a surprisingly heart-breaking final freeze frame ( the incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch ) , this unjustly overlooked early 80 's psycho sleeper is well worth checking out . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is not so much of a review as it is a testament that it has been proven , yet again , that the Academy rewards money , not artistic accomplishment .

" Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . Face it , Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters . That said , I believe the movie did a good , not excellent , job at depicting Karen 's life . The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV , but the content fell a little short . I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70 's . You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was . Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen 's talent . Also , Karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser . My choice for playing Karen is Hilary Swank . I would love to see a more substantive story , because there was more to Karen than meets the eyes when listening to We 've Only Just Begun .

" This movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers , especially contemporary audiences . Nevertheless I enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down-to-earth charm of William Holden , one of my favorite stars , and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones . There are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors rescues what in lesser hands could 've been trite lines .

" I know that originally , this film was NOT a box office hit , but in light of recent Hollywood releases ( most of which have been decidedly formula-ridden , plot less , pointless , " " save-the-blonde-chick-no-matter-what " " drivel ) , Feast of All Saints , certainly in this sorry context deserves a second opinion . The film--like the book--loses anchoring in some of the historical background , but it depicts a uniquely American dilemma set against the uniquely horrific American institution of human enslavement , and some of its tragic ( and funny , and touching ) consequences.And worthy of singling out is the youthful Robert Ri 'chard , cast as the leading figure , Marcel , whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets out in the beginning of his ' coming of age , ' only to be cruelly disappointed at what turns out to become his true education in the ways of the Southern plantation world of Louisiana , at the apex of the antebellum period . When I saw the previews featuring the ( dreaded ) blond-haired Ri 'chard , I expected a buffoon , a fop , a caricature--I was pleasantly surprised.Ossie Davis , Ruby Dee , the late Ben Vereen , Pam Grier , Victoria Rowell and even Jasmine Guy lend vivid imagery and formidable skill as actors in the backdrop tapestry of placage , voodoo , Creole " " aristocracy , " " and Haitian revolt woven into this tale of human passion , hate , love , family , and racial perplexity in a society which is supposedly gone and yet somehow is still with us . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First of all , those who are faint at heart should definitely avoid this film . Even those , like me , who are desensitized to most graphically violent and sexual acts in movies should beware . I 'm not telling you to steer away from the film , but be aware that what you 're about to see is some disturbing material . Definitely not a pleasing film to watch , but nothing is put on screen strictly for shock value . But I must admit , when I watched the film for a second time , I had to skip to the next chapter when the " " razor blade scene " " came up . The main character is one of the most unsympathetic sympathetic characters I can think of , but we start to better realize the humanity of her character later in the film 's second act . In one scene , she stuffs broken glass in one of her student 's jacket pocket after being dissatisfied with her apparently unsatisfactory performance and getting nervous when in front of a live audience . The student goes into her pocket and cries out with pain as she stares at her blood-stained hand . Next to the razor blade scene , that disturbed me most . The student 's mother is not much more sympathetic than she . When she gets word that her daughter won 't be able to play , she talks about it like she also got also her hand injured , being one of those spoiled mothers who tries to torture her daughter into becoming an overachiever . Though the film intrigued me and caught my interest for the most part , I felt more needed to be explained about Isabelle Huppert 's character . When a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porno movies and engaging in that behavior herself , you want to understand the root of the problem . The movie establishes that she wants desperately to be loved . Then why the hateful attitude towards everyone ? Why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain ? The acting is terrific and I liked the glossy , stylized lighting . Altogether , it 's not a film I 'd recommend if you 're in the mood to be entertained , but as I said it 's very intriguing . And I 'm sure if I watched it a few more times , I 'd be able to spot certain subtleties that 'll shed more light on aspects of the film I didn 't realize initially . My score : 7 ( out of 10 ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" After seeing the trailer it was an easy decision not to see this film . I mean , I don 't care for stupid " " stoner comedies .

I really enjoyed it . Nice locations , quality production and excellent performances from the entire cast . Looking back at it , the plot twists weren 't totally unexpected , but I didn 't find it cumbersome because the premise was so engaging.So why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy ? Did something happen to the producer , leaving the associate producers to do the marketing by themselves ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In 1990 Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis did a TV Too Young To Die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in Kalifornia . I have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film.Kalifornia finds aspiring writer David Duchovny and his girl friend , art photographer Michelle Forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to Duchovny 's obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers . In fact he 's got a most unusual odyssey planned , he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers . But he and Forbes are flat broke.Fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip . It turns out Pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own , delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality.Kalifornia is not the type of film I usually go for , but in fact the acting ability and charisma of Brad Pitt make it work to a large degree . Pitt is the walking definition of an inbred Gothic refugee from Deliverance . But better than he is is Juliette Lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well . Watch her scene with Forbes as she does her hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life . Lewis 's dialog and Forbes 's reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country.For those who like their slasher flicks , they don 't come better than Kalifornia . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The funniest performance was by Shalom Harlow , as Matt Dillon 's supermodel girlfriend . She was more interesting to me than all the lead actors .

" I first saw this movie on an Alaska Airlines flight , and have since seen it twice more . It simply is -- and is simply -- one of the best films in years . I found myself having enjoyed it after my first viewing , but a little cloudy on what had happened . After seeing it again a few weeks later , things began to fall into place . It wasn 't confusing , just deep . In fact , the depth of the movie may not be appreciated for a long time . For example , it occurred to me only after my third viewing that Sammy Davis Jr Jr ( Grandfather 's dog ) is more than just a pet -- perhaps she 's the stand-in for his dead wife . Witness how fiercely he protects her . There is symbolism galore , and none of it sappy or indulgent , just real . The adventure of their trip keeps the story-line in perpetual motion , and even when they arrive , you 're not sure if it really was the destination . As the movie continues , so does the adventure and I got the sense the destination was merely a way-point . The sound-track is fun , the scenery compelling -- and both decidedly eastern-block . I could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film , but I 'm not entirely sure I 've discovered all the nuances yet . Besides , it 's more fun to tease these out yourself . As much as any film can be , " " Everything Is Illuminated " " has proved to be like a fine wine that sweetens with time . I highly recommend seeing it -- twice . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Distortion is a disturbing , haunting film , about life imitating art and art reflecting life . Haim Bouzaglo , the director of the film , plays the role of Haim Bouzaglo , artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright , who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friend 's documentary . As an Arab suicide bomber , disguised in skullcap and American t-shirt , wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves , Haim transcribes his girl friend 's life as she films her documentary and incorporates himself and his actors ' lives during rehearsals . But the bomber has already struck and Haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier . Despite the manipulation of time and space , the story is crystal clear , comprehensive and absorbing , a brilliant commentary on the " " distortion " " of everyday Israeli life , where the political is intertwined with the personal , where everyone lives " " on the edge , " " and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely dispensable bit players in someone else 's dramatic narrative.Bouzaglo plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone else 's production brilliantly . We are always voyeurs , seeing what the fictional director sees illicitly but also what the " " real " " director chooses to reveal . To remind us that these glimpses are violations of privacy , Bouzaglo takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom ( sometimes the bedroom is the street and rooftop ) , and repeatedly frames his views within TV , video , or security screens . Actors play the role of actors who represent the " " real " " characters played by actors . Of course , each of the actors is the star of his or her own production , only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actor 's personal films . The detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play . The actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for " " tips " " on how to play the role , is caught by the detective on surveillance tapes , and they attend a cast party as their real selves.Despite this multiplicity of views , there is no mistaking the clear lines of this narrative : the playwright searches for subject matter , the bomber seeks a target , and the detective stalks the filmmaker . Nor is there any difficulty locating Bouzaglo 's ultimate target혰enervated and impotent Israel , fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action . Israel is Bouzaglo , the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play . Israel is also the bankrupt soldier-entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmaker 's documentary , the cheating actors and actresses , and the cuckolded husband . They are all Israel because they are all helpless , caught in inaction or aimless action , as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target . All the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep " " score " " of victims.There is personal triumph , vindication , perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film , but viewers will be left aching for the state of Israel even as they are filled with admiration for Bouzaglo 's memorable rendition of a nation 's plight within the telling of an individual 's story . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The " " Hunting Trilogy " " of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck ! Rabbit ! Duck !

While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the " " greatest " " or " " most important " " cartoons in the history of animation , they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I 've ever seen .

" What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I 've been paying to see in theatres recently . I like to be surprised . So often movies are marketed as " " offbeat , " " but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel . This movie is genuinely different , with the bonus of a heartwarming message . Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel . Even though he is required by the plot to sing some of the most mawkishly sentimental songs ever written , he does them so well one doesn 't mind .

" Bill Crain 's rarer than rare ' slasher ' movie certainly doesn 't follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts . The bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons ; - a sin that 's virtually unacceptable in most post-Halloween genre pieces . But there 's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you 've grown to expect . Just as Wally Koz 's surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family , Mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director . Looking through the credits I noticed numerous ' Crains ' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature . But despite fairly good distribution across the globe , the movie failed to make an impression either side of the Atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the VHS market . Nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so I strained my resources to track a copy down혚 It all takes place in the middle of the dessert , which as I 'm sure you 'll agree is hardly the most exciting location . With that said though , I must admit that there 's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey John Q Laws turning up unexpectedly . Four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way . Chris ( Jennifer McAllister ) and her boyfriend Greg ( Kenny Johnson ) meet up with amusing new age hippies Trip ( Kevin McParland ) and Mary ( Nicole Anton ) at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune-like wilderness . Greg 's older brother Kyle ( Todd Schaefer ) and his buxom girlfriend Bambi ( Laura Albert ) soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave . Kyle used to date Chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze 혯 something that Kyle doesn 't seem too keen to forget . Sound like a motive for a massacre ? Well what did you expect ? Before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve . Will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel ? I have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature . I don 't even know if director Bill Crain is aka William Crain 혯 the man behind Midnight Fear and Blacula among others . Mirage certainly doesn 't appear on his official filmography , so your guess is as good as mine . Judging by the credible work behind the camera , I 'd have to say that I find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience . The film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from DP Michael Crain , and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it 's necessary . R. Christopher Biggs ' gore FX are imaginatively created and gruesome , and kudos to the sleepy head over at the BBFC who inexplicably let this pass through UNCUT on a usually stringent 18 rating . A couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre . One guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade , while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck ! There 's also some black humor that 's surely unintentional . We spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer 's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters . But when he 's revealed to hilariously resemble Keanu Reeves circa Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey , I didn 't quite know what to expect . Thankfully Crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts Chris sadistically.There are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast . The divine Jennifer McAllister does a superb job as the heroine and B.G. Steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse . The Casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn 't come at the cost of thespian potential . The soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation , which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by Hollywood bigwigs . Watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film-making at it 's freakiest.Mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite . When you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck , you have to say that they did a damn good job . The flaws are numerous , but never detract credibility from the net result . Unfortunately you 've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy . If you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store , then make sure you pick it up . Recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Reading through the comments , there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional banality of La Pianiste . I find this hard to comprehend given the outstanding performance by Isabelle Huppert . Huppert is gripping - she manages to convey perfectly the woman on the edge , full of self-hate and delusion.The film is wonderfully paced and judged . It would be so easy to portray the lead as a ridiculous figure - consider the scene in the porn store for instance . Somehow , Huppert is able to carry it off , partly because of her brilliant performance but also because the director makes her surreal life real and identifiable.Don 't ignore this film . It is one of the most startling and engaging films ( and performances ) I have seen.Trust Boris ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I viewed this movie for the first time last night and I enjoyed every aspect of it 혯the dancing , the acting , the dialogue , the plot , the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created . I would highly recommend it.Jennifer Grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as Frances ( Baby ) Houseman . She has a natural ability and flair for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor . But what is wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character . This is not simply a movie about dancing but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see Baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life . Grey portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you end up feeling deeply for Baby as she experiences all she does in this movie.Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive . He gives his character a comprehensive personality , strong appeal and great depth . The chemistry between Swayze and Grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie Cynthia Rhodes is great in her role of Penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film . The other members of the supporting cast 혯Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention here-also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience . The dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved . The script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful fashion . The plot , although exceedingly predictable , is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful . Furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes . ' Dirty Dancing ' is a truly powerful , magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance . I highly recommend it , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The kind of movie that demands too much from the audience , yet to disappoint most of them . I think of the Mexican people who ( either in an attempt to support Mexican movies or willing to see a film casting top Mexican stars ) saw it , half of the people went out of the theater when I went to watch it , it 's definitely not the kind of movie one could expect . I think too of the people from other countries who dared spending 2 hours seeing it till the very end , " " what a piece of crap " . " In order to understand Cronica de un desayuno , one has to be mexican , and one has to be familiar with the low middle classes ( or even better , be part of them ) . There 's nothing accidental in this movie , the family is and has what many families , in Mexico at least , share . One has to see it with a wide open mind to accept it entirely , it 's not the kind of movie that you fully understand after you watch it . The older brother wouldn 't let anyone sit on his RED couch , the sister is staying no matter how she wants to leave , the younger brother is going to an excursion , and all he cares about is the yellow radio , the mother has to prepare the breakfast for the family , no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is . The father came back after who knows how long , allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be momentary , and ends up by repeating all the attitudes of his sons ... The stories around the house are surrealistic ( and so is the movie ) , a travestite looking for his penis , a factory worker and his attempt of suicide , subtled by the kisses of his girlfriend , a fat man riding his bicycle after a interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister ? wife ? mother ? ... The music doesn 't pretend too much but it achieves a lot , not more than a snare drum , cymbal , a some strings . Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.One of the best mexican movies ever ! , and one of the less understood , even by mexican themselves , no matter how identified the should have felt with it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" While I would say I enjoy the show , I expected something completely different from when I first saw ' What I like about you ' I expected to find something along the lines of ' All That ' ( I am not sure if it is going on anymore ) but I have to say I do like the show and while i don 't classify it as a breakthrough show , it is very charming and I do like the chemistry between the characters as well ( including the supporting cast ) I would definitely say that it is great to see Wesley Jonathan back on the screen because I really loved him in City Guy . I had also seen the woman who plays Valerie 's friend in Popular and while I think that was an okay show , I do not really like her character in this show because she 's just not my cup of tea but she rounds it out pretty well , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I guess I 'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film . Is it one of the best of the " " Nightmare " " series ? Maybe not , but I had lots of fun with it . Freddy Krueger reaches his evil , wisecracking potential . Since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down , I felt this so-called final installment ( " " New Nightmare " " is the real finale ) brought the series out of its slump . There are some great nightmare sequences , including one where Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed , falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which Freddy controls . This is both a highly original and hilarious sequence , especially when we see him out of the dreamscape , hopping around like Super Mario . And Freddy belts out the funny one-liner , " " Great graphics . " " And since the movie was made about 10 years ago , it brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with the Powerglove . Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers the Powerglove . The cast is superb . Lisa Zane is perfectly cast in the lead . I haven 't seen Yaphet Kotto since " " The Running Man , " " and I think the last time I saw that film was about 5 years ago . He 's another great , underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence . And who can forget the cameos ? The best one is by Johnny Depp ( from the first " " Nightmare " " ) playing a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial . The 3D sequence at the end is really awesome ! So for those who are looking to check this film out--please rent or buy it on DVD ! Hopefully all the editions come with the 3D glasses , but I 'm sure the video edition has the 3D element removed . I personally didn 't see many things wrong with the film . It even elaborated on Freddy 's backstory . The film is a great mix of humor and scares , and the gross-out effects are terrific . Could this have given better justice to the franchise ? Of course it could have . But Rachel Talalay did a fine job . And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done.And in closing , I loved the montage over the opening credits . Fans of the series will be delighted , and will look at it as a tribute to beloved Freddy . My score : 7 ( out of 10 ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat . Lake Bell is wonderful .. it is to bad that her other show " " Miss Match " " was canceled . I am just glad she came back on " " Surface " . " I can 't wait for the return of " " Surface " . " This show is really something unique to watch . With an eerie underwater world that is akin to Jurassic Park , this show keeps you wondering what is next . Nim is adorable even if he is going to turn into something larger and much more ominous . There are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old subjects . When something like " " Surface " " comes along you just have to say " " THANK YOU ! " .

" This is an amazing film to watch or show young people . Aside from a very brief nude scene , it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in Africa that you 'll rarely find in other films . It does bear a superficial similarity to OUT OF Africa , but without all the romantic fluff . The White French people in Cameroon are fascinating because they don 't even seem to regard the natives as people . The Whites are all the bosses and they expect Black servitude without question . However , unlike real servants , you only once hear any of the Whites say ' thank you ' and no other regard is given these people . Again and again , it 's like they are pets or slaves , as the feelings of the people are never even considered . The central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother , Aim챕e and her servant , Prot챕e . Although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other , the White woman never considers Prot챕e or the existence of his feelings . A good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has Prot챕e lace up her dress and it 's obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this . Apart from this relationship , while almost all the Whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the Africans are people , a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage.Also interesting is the relationship between Prot챕e and the little girl ( who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film ) . While they are very close , at times he 's more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native children.There is one bizarre White character who seems , at times , to regard the Blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing . One moment , he 's doing hard work along side the Blacks or eating with them ( something the other Whites would never have done ) and the next he 's trying to beat up Prot챕e ! I could only guess as to what motivated him--perhaps he was just a jerk , or was crazy or perhaps was a Communist agitator trying to stir up the Blacks against the Whites ( who knows ! ) . In fact , other than a few good scenes , this character seems pretty much wasted.While I really enjoyed the insight this movie gave , I wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life . The context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more . The film appeared to begin in the early 1980s ( since she 's wearing a Walkman-style headset ) and when the film went back in time , it seems that it was set about 1960 ( more or less ) , but there was never any mention of the 1950s anti-colonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early 1960s . I am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and SHOULD have made the beginning of the film earlier ( such as the 1970s ) and had the lady think back to her life there in the early 1950s--before the country experienced political change.Apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods , using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea . And I also appreciated the ending , as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride . But overall , it just feels like something is missing--there just isn 't any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released . Ben Affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for Christmas . He then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for Christmas cheer . I have not been a Ben Affleck fan in the past ( though I did like Daredevil and Paycheck ) but here he is well cast in this role . I also like Christina Applegate as the daughter in the family who can 't stand Affleck 's character at first . Sure you can see where this movie is going but you don 't care . Ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of Christmas movies . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Actually this movie has silly moments , both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part , and it 's much worse than other MJ movies like " " The Wiz " , " " " Captain Eo " " and " " Ghosts " . " But as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years , ( Yeah , that 's half my life , you guys ! ) , I can 't complain too much about it . Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to Heaven for me . But as a movie , it 's not good at all , and I 'm afraid , that it would get a much lower grade for me , if my darling Mike hadn 't been the one starring in it .

" If ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone , disabled or not , to persevere despite the odds and make it ( even when " " make it " " as an expression , proper , can have a wide berth which is an ultimately personal truth ) , MY LEFT FOOT is it . It 's a hard film to watch at times : seeing the less placid aspects of Christy Brown 's personality emerge in two key scenes -- one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction , and at a dinner table when the woman who 's reached out to him , made him able to communicate effectively , now has announced at a key moment ( the inauguration of Brown 's art ) she is about to marry another man -- is tough . Very , very tough . More so because this is a man who cannot react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how : via screams , shrieks , and profanities aimed at hurting himself . However , this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing the autobiographical account , but that of a man overcoming his severe disability , becoming a functioning human being and a force of be reckoned with in the art world . Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful , unforgettable performance as the flawed but tenacious Christy Brown , and Brenda Fricker did so as well for her supporting role as Brown 's solid mother . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hong Kong filmmaker Chang Chang Ho 's 1972 martial arts movie epic " " Five Fingers of Death " " is widely considered by a great many film experts and kung-fu movie fanatics to be the martial arts movie that started it all.Being released in 1972 , it was phase-two of the three-step process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts movies in the West - " " Billy Jack " " ( 1971 ) , with its famous Hapkido showdown in the park , was released the year before , and Bruce Lee starred in " " Enter the Dragon " " ( 1973 ) two years later , thereby solidifying martial arts movies ' place in Western cinema.But what is all the hoopla about regarding " " Five Fingers of Death " " ? The movie , with its terrible dubbing , explosive ( if not highly improbable ) action sequences and technical flaws and all , has a plot , albeit a very thin one . Chih-Hao ( the late Lo Lieh ) is a young and dedicated student of Chinese gong-fu who is selected to represent his school in an upcoming martial arts tournament . His teacher offers to allow him to self-train in the " " Iron Fist " " style of fighting , a style so deadly that it could very easily kill a man with only one blow.Additionally , Chih-Hao 's arrival at the school coincides with a violent conflict with a rival school , its students , and a trio of murderous heavy hitters from Japan . Before you know it , a major setback threatens Chih-Hao 's training , and his ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming tournament.Let me just say that " " Five Fingers of Death " " is in fact the movie that started it all . As another viewer mentioned , " " Five Fingers of Death " " helped to set a lot of standards in martial arts movies over the next three decades - Asian , European , and North American martial arts movies . Such standards include the dedicated student , the learning of patience and endurance , conflicts between rival schools , the intense ethnic animosity between the Chinese and Japanese , and learning a system of fighting for that good old-fashioned action movie motive : revenge . " " Five Fingers of Death " " would also serve as a major influence on American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino 's " " Kill Bill " " movies ( Tarantino borrows quite liberally from this project , among many others , just so you know ) .The acting is pretty good , considering the fact that this is a martial arts movie from the early 1970s , the best of which is Lo Lieh . As the atypical student of the martial arts , his performance is quite groundbreaking , though upon first glance at this movie you wouldn 't really know it because of how that particular character arc has been done to death so many times over the years . He 's quite humble in his acting , doing anything he can to persevere over his enemies and not fight them in anger or stoop to their level of stupidity or arrogance . Also , when he suffers his major setback , it does make your heart sink a little bit because it 's so brutal and you wonder if he 's going to recover enough to realize his life-long ambition . " " Five Fingers of Death " " is a classic in every sense . It 's by no means perfect , and viewers would be crazy to expect something on the caliber of the " " Godfather " " of martial arts movies . What it does offer you is the ultimate example of Eastern hand-to-hand combat from the time before Eastern cinema was a major fixture in the West.7 / 10P.S. : " " Enter the Dragon " " Bolo Yeung also appears as the Mongolian street fighter near the beginning of the film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I liked this movie a lot , but the feeling that I most came away with was the memory of how much I쨈d enjoyed the novel . The film features two of the best actresses working today--Jessica Lange , who is great here , and the divine Jennifer Jason Leigh , who does the best she can with the thinly-drawn character she is given--as well as a surprisingly excellent Michelle Pfeiffer and a steady Jason Robards . The adaptation is basically faithful to the book , at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes . The film doesn쨈t really dazzle , except for certain scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer , but it does a thoroughly competent job of visualizing this wonderfully tragic story . As far as movies adapted from novels go , this was definitely among the better ones . If nothing else , it has sent me back to my bookshelves to rediscover favorite passages from Jane Smiley쨈s excellent novel , and back to King Lear to brush up on the minor characters in order to see just how deep the parallels go . Worth your time as a film , definitely , and hopefully enough to make you remember that reading great literature is a joy as well . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Von Trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world . So as viewers we think we watch a " " true " " story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated , often to the point that the movie works disturbing ( Dancer in the Dark ) or painful ( The Idiots / Idioterne ) . Of course the Dogme-films acted only as a vehicle for this theory ( besides creating some welcome spotlight on Von Trier ) .The story is typical for Von Trier : our hero is idealistic , seems to balance his relations with everybody else , but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves . The idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist . Mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to ( self- ) destruction . ( These elements were also very omnipresent in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark . ) The movie is also full of cynical ( even humorous ) undertones about the role of the Germans and Americans in post-war Germany.As a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed : shifting and fading washed-out colors , screen overlays , action on different overlays ( with the shooting of the soon-to-be mayor as the most interesting ) . In this movie we can see how good Von Trier 's handles film as a technical medium . In his later works he seems to step down from this ( as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Stardust Another Guarded Review ( originally written June 15 , 2007 ) The marketing machine has only just begun for this one ( no site yet ? wth ? ) , so I doubt most of you have heard about it . In truth , I hadn 't either ( sort of ) . When I got the posting , I thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was Transformers , one of the movies I want to see when not working so I an enjoy it 100 % as a mere mortal movie-goer . Turns out , it wasn 't Transformers and I had been aware of it way back when as ' that Neil Gaiman movie ' . What is it about ? Well , in short , it 's a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star . Any more than that and I 'd be giving away plot info which is ( a ) a breach of contract , and ( b ) spoiling your fun . If you really want to know what it 's about , go buy the book . Rumour has it , Gaiman might be something of a writer.Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile . And for this one , it certainly was . This screening was ' special ' in that it included not just film critics , but also exhibitors ( they rarely have a mixed screening ) and local sci-fi / fantasy folks . So , you know the expected audience , right ? I mean , with this crowd and the title of Stardust , I knew what to expect.Oh how sweetly wrong I was.Yes , it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom . But it was not Lord of Rings . It was not even another Lord of the Rings wannabe ( ahem , Eragon ) . It was much more intimate than all that.But , like Lord of the Rings , it was the , well , humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities . It 's surely a romantic tale , but with generous splashes of humour . And that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick Shrekism . It 's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy . Before I go on , let 's do this movie review thing.Acting is , in the very least , good . It 's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but I do believe there were significant superbly acted roles . Michelle Pfieffer is not , sadly , one of those . She plays a villain , and she does the job . Nothing special . Rupert Everett , though , he was a real jerk . That is , a great villain . Peter O 'Toole is , well , Peter frickin ' O 'Toole -- which is marvelous . Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why . Robert De Niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part . When he wanted to deliver the goods , though , he did . And Charlie Cox ( who ? ) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy I ain 't never heard of.Claire Danes . Claire Danes . Claire Danes . I 've always been of mixed opinion with her . She can be great , and then she can seem to miss the mark . In this , she 's the former . And she is , quite literally , the star of this film . Sure , her accent stumbles here and there . And , yes , she 's not as good as she can be when Cox isn 't in the scene . However ... well , see for yourself.Special effects are muted yet accomplished , and only significant where they should be . Best flying ship yet -- sorry Potter . Direction is light-hearted and flows nicely . Cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in New Zealand . All else is top bracket.And now that that 's done ...... the writing . Oh , the writing ! Neil , you devil . It 's hard in today 's climate to do anything original and , at first , you begin to wonder . A kingdom , a dying King , a boy out to prove his own worth , witches , ghosts , a quest ( or three ) -- what 's new ? But Gaiman 's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart . And , though you suspect how it 's all going to turn out , you begin to wonder in the third act and -- if you 're me -- find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best . In the end , you 'll find this story , this movie , is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not . Fantastical and real . ( I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan but I won 't ruin it for you . For those who read the book , rest assured , it 's done properly . ) Those I spoke to afterward had the same impression I did . A great film for all ages to enjoy , and the new { WITHHELD } for this generation . The blank gets filled-in only after the movie is in wide release because , well , you might be expecting it . You 'll know when you walk out , anyway . I sincerely hope Stardust doesn 't get lost among the tentpoles . Even if it does , it 'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone I know.---Forgot to add the { WITHHELD } reveal . I 'm a few years late , but ... " " A great film for all ages to enjoy , and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation .

This was his first sound movie and the use of the musical score by great russian composer Serge Prokofiev in the sequence of the battle is a perfect contrast between music and image .

" Scott Bartlett 's ' OffOn ' is nine minutes of pure craziness . It is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic , pulsating , epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours , and the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema . There 's no story to speak of , but Bartlett uses images of nature 혯 particularly the human face and form 혯 to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions , integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology . In a sense , the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools , his machinery , his technology . This theme connects loosely with the subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubrick 's ' 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) , ' and , indeed , Bartlett 's opening sequence of images 혯 flashing colours before a close-up human eye 혯 recalls Dave Bowman 's journey through the Stargate . The visuals are richly-coloured , a confronting blend of sharp , vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video , as though we 're sitting too close to a television screen { as a matter of fact , the end product was recorded from a TV monitor } .There appears to be some confusion about the film 's release date . IMDb lists the film as a 1972 release , but both the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Foundation give 1968 as the correct year . Perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film 's completion and its first public screening . Either way , the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time , occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video , and some brisk techno music wouldn 't have gone amiss , either ! ' OffOn ' captures grainy , fragmented images , presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information . I had a thought 혯 and please don 't laugh at this free-thinking interpretation 혯 that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earth 's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed , alien documentation of human life , a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn 't possibly make any coherent sense . Perhaps this is where Mankind , with all his technology , is eventually heading , towards an irreversible merging of film and video , of purity and artificiality . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Moon Child , starring Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt , was a better movie then I expected . In fact , I was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies.Set in Mallepa , the story follows a group of street orphans , Sho , Sho 's brother Shinji , and Toshi who rob and murder to make a living . On one of robberies , Sho encounters Hyde 's Kei vampire burning in the sunlight . Through the coarse of events Kei 's true nature is shown , yet no one shuns him away.The time passes and implies that the immortal , never-changing Kei has raised Sho , and the two have a an extremely close bond . Sho and Kei then encounter Son in an outrageous gun fight , and they become quick friends . Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with Son 's sister , Yi-Che.Time skips ahead again and shows a grown Sho , this time void of Kei . It also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies.Through tragedy after tragedy this movie dives into the reality of life and all it 's hardships , focusing on friendship and love . It is a truly touching movie that is sad yet beautiful at the same time.As for the acting , I think Gackt did a magnificent job . Hyde did an amazing job for a first timer.The shots were beautiful , but the movie did have it 's rare and short gruesome shots.All in all , I must say this movie is amazing , moving , and I highly recommend it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something " " not human " " is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them . Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals . Although - it 's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans ! : - ) This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film . It mentions alcohol * , shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack " " tresspassing " " humans and it shows a male cat called ( Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Casi Thomas ) O ' Malley , fancying a female cat , in a surprisingly human and adult way.As a cartoon film - or just a film in general , I feel this is pretty good quality - the storyline and characters are especially good . The film ( in general ) is set in France and you meet a family of cats - the mother Duchess and her kittens Marie , Toulouse and Berlioz . You also meet the kind ( rich ) old woman who adores the cats , the butler Edgar and an old man ( who has CLEARLY lost his marbles ) called George . The kind old woman discusses her will with George and Edgar overhears that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it . He is INCREDIBLY cross with this - and has an evil scheme in mind ... A very cute film for every age - enjoy " " Aristocats " " ! * Not including " " Basil the Great Mouse Detective " " and a few others maybe which I cannot think of at the moment . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This modern film noir with its off beat humour and dizzying succession of plot twists delivers a story full of surprises , dangerous characters and excellent entertainment from start to finish . It 's impossible not to empathise with the honest , unassuming hero or to be gripped by the ways in which he tries to navigate his way out of the terrible predicaments that he finds himself in , so all you can do is fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride.The story of an ordinary guy who makes a poor decision and then finds that the repercussions propel him into an uncontrollable sequence of events from which he is unable to extricate himself is pure film noir . The same is true of the themes of murder , deceit , corruption and duplicity which are pervasive throughout . Many of the familiar noir visual motifs are also present , such as the way in which cigarette smoke is lit , the rain soaked roads at night , the heavily shadowed interiors and the lines of shadow ( created by louvred doors ) across people 's faces.Michael Williams ( Nicolas Cage ) , an injured war veteran without money or a job , stops off at a bar in Red Rock , Wyoming and is mistaken by the proprietor Wayne Brown ( J T Walsh ) for a hit man that he 's arranged to employ to murder his wife Suzanne ( Lara Flynn Boyle ) . Michael , a naturally reticent person , does nothing to disabuse Wayne of his misapprehension , especially as he could use a job and at first doesn 't realise what he 'd be expected to do . After having been told what his mission is and been given a $ 5,000 advance , he goes to see Suzanne and warns her about Wayne 's plan . She doesn 't seem overly concerned about the danger she 's in and offers Michael double the fee Wayne had offered , for him to eliminate her husband.Michael decides to take the money he 'd received from both parties and leave town . His plan fails however , when he accidentally drives into a man who is standing in the middle of the road and decides to take him to hospital to receive treatment for his injuries . At the hospital , things get more complicated when it emerges that the patient is Suzanne 's lover and he has two bullets in his stomach . This leads to the local law enforcement officers getting involved and the revelation that Wayne is the Sheriff ! ! From this point on , things get even more complicated and also decidedly more dangerous especially when the real hit man , Lyle from Dallas ( Dennis Hopper ) arrives on the scene . " " Red Rock West " " has some great moments of suspense , ( an example of this is the scene in which Michael makes his escape from Wayne 's bar ) and also some great performances from its very strong cast . Nicolas Cage 's expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he reacts to a variety of situations with anxiety , surprise or uncertainty and J T Walsh is also particularly good as a deceptive character who 's always concealing more than he 's actually saying . Dennis Hopper is intensely threatening as the vicious contract killer ( a role he plays with great gusto ) and Lara Flynn Boyle looks suitably cold and calculating as the femme fatale . Dwight Yoakam also provides some good support and moments of humour in his cameo role as a no nonsense truck driver.Incredibly , " " Red Rock West " " was originally destined to be denied a general cinema release but has justifiably emerged from its modest beginnings to eventually be recognised as the great movie that it really is . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Now maybe it had something to do with the fact that I saw this movie at a low point in my life , when I was really trying to figure out where I was going and what I needed to make myself happy , but this film really spoke to me . Jane is an everywoman : although she has so many positive things going for her , she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life . She is strong and intelligent , but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second-choice life . She seeks out new challenges and happiness , seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart . Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane . As we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair , the torture of her desperation and , eventually , the strength of her conviction . The beautiful Addie Yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production . Allison Mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing . I highly recommend this film ; although it 's low budget , it has big budget writing and production values . PS- great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women . Women will love the story and characters , but there 's something for the men here , too . : ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a rule , a Full Moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a film . But because I 've enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films , I gave it a shot.It 's not bad . Not great , but that 's something else . The film involves a struggle with a mystic ( evil ) " " brother " " who wants to dominate the worlds , and the title character . Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people , and authorities in the mundane world , which he does successfully.Possible spoilers follow.Dr. Mordrid can travel between " " dimensions , " " and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress ; however , the guard has been blinded .

This sort of healing apparently only works with eyes.Later , Mordred and his " " brother " " animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight .

Dr. Mordred 's more " " human " " adventures are okay , and Combs plays the role convincingly.I 've seen lots worse . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is one of the best animated movies I 've ever seen in my life . This isn 't just a fun movie , or a well-made movie . This is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren 't , just the technical skill that went into making it , would grant it a place in the history of animation.Wladyslaw Starewicz created a stop-motion movie about the secret life of beetles . He imagined a coherent world of insects , with jobs , houses , nightclubs , movie houses , even little props like posters and bicycles and paintings.In this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge . Mr. Beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly , much to the chagrin of a grasshopper ; but he 's a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling . Mr. Beetle returns home and finds Mrs. Beetle having her own affair . Mr. Beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife . The two make up and go out to the movies . And the movie they watch is Mr. Beetle and the Dragonfly . Described thus it sounds banal , but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema . Along with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka , Wladyslaw Starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work . For that reason he must not remain forgotten . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My favorite movie genre is the western , it 's really the only movie genre that is of American origin . And despite Sergio Leone , no one does them quite like Americans.Right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is Winchester 73 . It was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart . It was also a landmark film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from Universal . Many such deals followed for players , making them as rich as the moguls who employed them.Anthony Mann up to this point had done mostly B pictures , noir type stuff with no real budgets . Just before Winchester 73 Mann had done a fine western with Robert Taylor , Devil 's Doorway , that never gets enough praise . I 'm sure James Stewart must have seen it and decided Mann was the person he decided to partner with.In this film Mann also developed a mini stock company the way John Ford was legendary for . Besides Stewart others in the cast like Millard Mitchell , Steve Brodie , Dan Duryea , John McIntire , Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson would appear in future Mann films.It 's a simple plot , James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him . Why I won 't say , but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of James Stewart on screen . Anthony Mann reached into Jimmy Stewart 's soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have.The hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film . After Stewart and sidekick Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because guns aren 't carried in Earp 's Dodge City . There 's a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the betting favorite is Dutch Henry Brown , played with menace by Stephen McNally . Stewart , Mitchell and Geer go into the saloon and Stewart and McNally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren 't there . Look at the closeups of Stewart and McNally , they say more than 10 pages of dialog.Another character Stewart runs into in the film is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea who almost steals the film . This may have been Duryea 's finest moment on screen . He 's a psychopathic outlaw killer who 's deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns . Another person Stewart meets is Shelley Winters who 's fianc챕 is goaded into a showdown by Duryea and killed . Her best scenes are with Duryea who 's taken a fancy to her . She plays for time until she can safely get away from him . Guess who she ultimately winds up with ? There are some wonderful performances in some small roles , there ain 't a sour note in the cast . John McIntire as a shifty Indian trader , Jay C. Flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and Rock Hudson got his first real notice as a young Indian chief . Even John Alexander , best known as ' Theodore Roosevelt ' in Arsenic and Old Lace has a brief , but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times.Mann and Stewart did eight films together , five of them westerns , and were ready to do a sixth western , Night Passage when they quarreled and Mann walked off the set . The end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" We are in a small town , a homely widow ( Ida Lupino ) hires a handyman ( Robert Ryan ) to look after her house . She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour , it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic , and now she is unable to escape her house.Beware , My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinelli 's { The Spiral Staircase } story and play called " " The Man " . " Pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece , the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness . One however shouldn 't be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture , because it isn 't . It 's clear from the get go that Ryan 's Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled man , but this is a different sort of " " peril " " movie . One that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist.Ryan and Lupino are a great combination , they had also done the excellent , and far better , On Dangerous Ground this same year . So with both actors clearly comfortable together , it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house , re : prison . Ryan is particularly strong as his character flits in and out of madness , with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others garnering deep sympathy . The direction from Harry Horner is safe { he in truth doesn 't have to do much other than let his actors run with it } and George E. Diskant 's cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches . With one involving Christmas tree baubles immensely memorable . Falling some where in between being average and great , Beware , My Lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow Film-Noir . For fans of Robert Ryan tho , it 's something of an essential viewing , oh yes , and then some . 7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I have not read the other comments on the film , but judging from the average rating I can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary.I watched it for the second time with my children . They absolutely loved it . True , it did not have the adults rolling around the floor , but the sound of the children 's enjoyment made it seem so.It is a true Mel Brooks farce , with plenty of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money , not for whom we are , and how fickle are our friends and associates . There are many other films on a similar subject matter , no doubt , many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults . It 's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family , however.Hence , for the children , a 9 / 10 from me . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This features traces of the " " giallo " " genre , but also with a vivid Italian countryside setting , where ignorance and superstition are deadlier than any serial killer . Featuring excellent location ( reminiscent sometimes of Fellini , sometimes of the Taviani brothers ) , good characterisation and some of the finest genre actors ( including the great Tomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role ) , this is NOT euro-trash , just a masterpiece that should be discovered generation after generation ( It recently recieved great acclaim at the Paris Cinematheque at a double-feature tribute to Lucio Fulci ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie answers the question , how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent , clinging , needy , jealous .. and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women ? Without spoiling the movie , I can safely assure you it does not , but there 's great fun to be had along the way . Uma Thurman is perfect as the mercurial super-heroine , an uber-babe , mysteriously named G-Girl , who unlike most in her sisterhood , is not * always * dedicated to truth , justice , and the American Way . Thurman is also believable as the thoroughly daft , yet somehow still fetching , curator Jenny . When she is dumped for a less endowed but more emotionally secure and well adjusted rival , G-Girl goes ballistic , and what follows is not pretty . It 's funny , but it 's not pretty .. It 's a delightful premise , hell hath no fury like a super-heroine scorned , and those involved don 't altogether carry it off , but it has its moments , and I think I 'll get the DVD.I liked this movie .. , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The very first image of the movie shows a mountain ridge in early morning autumn mist , and my thought was : " " This is almost too beautiful . " " And it goes on like this : Images of landscape and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings , each of them perfect in every detail . Even the girl 's room , her father 's car - everything is nostalgic , romantic , beautiful . This could seem outdated and escapistic , but it fits a story that is itself of silent beauty , happening on the border between life and fairy tale , between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince . I enjoyed every minute of it . The extreme parsimony of the movie , having a simple , slow story , just one actor and hardly any special effects , exerted a strong magic . I therefore find it deplorable that this parsimony is given up in the last minutes , when suddenly two additional actors ( the girl as a grown-up woman , and her son ) are introduced . Another shortcoming is the music , which is often intrusive , Hollywood-like , and sometimes inappropriate : I couldn 't bring an English pop-song together with French mountain glory . I went to the movie together with my two small daughters , but I recommend it to adults as well , given that they appreciate this kind of movie . Obviously , not everybody does . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Contrary to popular belief , this title , to me at least , is not so very bad . In fact . I regard it as a favoured film of all time . The welding of stories wasn 't structured too well when you consider the differences between the series , however despite all this , you can watch it quite happily . For a feature film of its day , the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently believable.The sound / audio track is a personal favourite of mine . Nearly everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices suit the characters much better than their , now badly cast US dub , counterparts . The sync is perfect in every shot . I had a few issues with the casting for the ' alien ' voices ( please forgive the crude naming , it has been a while since i 've seen it ) . Otherwise however , the cast seemed perfectly balanced . I feel and believe in the characters of this movie . Dubs are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago . I loved the OSD 's from back then but the castings often let series down.At this point i would like to add that this was one of the first anime i saw in my life . It has historical value to me , but even after seeing the original Megazone 23 it remained stronger and more watched in my collection.To my knowledge the title only ever made it to the US in Texas . Personally i think its a big shame . Had the correct audience been subject to it , i think Robotech the Movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years . I am involved with anime each day of my life and everyone i have shown this movie thought it was a nicely put together title.Watching the film after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the evident plot holes between shows . However , without seeing the originals , a viewer wouldn 't really notice . Since the animation is identical in style , there was no reason to question it back in its day . The UK had very limited access to anime . Laser discs were the most productive media . Personally i like the way Carl had the balls to at least push the genre . I mean Harmony wasn 't going to put up the cash for the series to get publicised.Despite the few picky faults people have had with this film , The eighties feel of it keeps me in love . If you watch Megazone 23 now , to its original Japanese audio , or the new dub , i believe you will be greatly disappointed with the OSD . Cast your minds back to the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub soundtrack and imagine new eighties audio to E.V.E.Saying all this . This film 's popularity nowadays is most likely down to its rarity on the open market . Personally , it spawned a collection for me . I 'm now scouring the world for merchandise from the three components that made it up and if i ever get to meet Carl Macek , ill shake his hand for the effort , and buy him a pint or a crate for getting me into anime . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense . Based on the book " " Evil Angels " " and titled so in its Australian release , A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch . It presents a scenario that 's all too real for us in America : the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target.Lindy Chamberlain was this woman . Being someone who spoke her mind , someone who didn 't play the sympathy card , and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal , she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn 't kill her own child . The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece . And through it all , Lindy remained as stoic as ever , even when her husband Michael was falling apart.This stance , of course , is the power of strength , as unsympathetic as it may look like , and people happen to react strongly to that . They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn , not sit there and look blank . People don 't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations . Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold , but not unfeeling woman , one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty . Because of her , Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to , or the Chamberlains would be too detached , and no one wants to see that . Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media . They 'll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The lament and almost unbearable melancholy of Amalia Rodriques ' music goes to a place in the soul that only music can stir . In her voice and magical presence , lies the exquisite agony of the Fado , an art form of which I was unaware until seeing this film.For me , the success of this beautifully and lovingly crafted documentary lies in the fact that the filmmaker resists the temptation to editorialize and simply allows us to share in the magnetism and elegant passion of this icon . There seems to be an inevitable corrolation between the Portuguese Fado and American Blues.Documentary filmmaking at its best , transports us to a previously unknown reality. and having been allowed this glimpse , we are transformed.Abrigado , Sr.de Almeida , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon 's most famous play about a TV newswriter named Felix Unger , who is an obsessive neat freak , who moves in with his divorced best friend , Oscar Madison , a sportswriter and complete slob , after his wife Frances throws him out of their apartment . Already divorced , Oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it . Neil Simon 's classic comedy first came to Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar . Jack Lemmon takes over for Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger . Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger . Matthau , fortunately , was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar , a one-of-a-kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout . This teaming of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re-visited in nine other films . With both of these actors no longer with us , the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious . Simon 's play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed Felix 's suicide attempt that is a winner . The supporting cast includes Herb Edelman , John Fiedler , Larry Haines , and David Sheiner as Oscar 's poker playing buddies and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon Sisters , blind dates of Oscar and Felix . Of course , it later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman , but there 's nothing like the original . A joy from start to finish . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wonderful family film that should be a staple at Christmas time . It 's a mystery to me why it isn 't . A true lost film that I first encountered , flickering away on my old 19 " " black and white RCA , when the Million Dollar Movie was still in vogue on Channel 9 in New York City . This Rudolph Mate directed fantasy should be nestled under everyone 's Christmas tree . But it has never been released on home video . Too bad . I believe I saw part of it on AMC a few years ago , before they cut many of their older films from the rotation . TCM should take up the slack and play it at Easter or on Christmas Eve . Any movie with Santa , Aunt Bee , the Hostess Cupcake Lady , and an actor with the first name King , can 't be bad . Ann Blyth as " " Sally " " is a bundle of energy .

So , after she graduates , she places a statue of St. Ann in her own bedroom . At one point the entire O 'Moyne residence is moved to another address . I think this was done to put an end to a neighbor dispute between the O 'Moynes and the dastardly fellow next door . Blyth is cute as a button . Edmund Gwen can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep . All-in-all , this is a satisfying movie experience . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend , my wife and her female friend . So I had views from all kinds of directions . Mainly , the film made me laugh , the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu . Yes , I do think she played her role well , even if the script was not appropriate . There were good Romanian actors around , they just didn 't have complex roles . I applaud Puya 's entering the movie business . I don 't know why , but I think he 's a good guy , I just hope he 'll be a good actor.The wife loved the movie , though , and I think there might have been chords being played and to which I had no ear for . If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays Romania , then it failed miserably . There were no consequences . Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl , and the same story becomes just a boring , uninteresting plot.I have no idea why it got all those BAFTA awards . In my book , it should have gotten the " " Better luck next time " " award . ( bafta = good luck in Romanian ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Shinjuku Triad Society : Chinese Mafia Wars is unlikely to get distribution in the West outside film festivals . Why ? Could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk ( and the victims enjoy it ) or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull ? These are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story . It makes Clockwork Orange which was banned for years in the UK look like a Disney cartoon.Should you see this film ? YES It is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of Asian cinema . The shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters . If you like this make sure you catch Dead or Alive which is very similar ( barring the insane ending in DOA of course ) . Great for Japan that they have a talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano . The best chance of seeing this film outside a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD . If I haven 't put you off try hunting for a Hong Kong version on the web as I 'm sure it will come out in that country . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" An occasionally surrealistic thriller that will push most people 's buttons . , the 4th Man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct . The story 's protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer , Gerard ( Krabbe ) , with a seriously twisted sense of imagination . Verhoeven offers upGerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man . He 's shiftless , delusional , unable to control his urges , afraid to commit tomeaningful relationships , and utterly apathetic about life in general . As the character himself states at one point , he is a professional liar , unable to recall the truth.The movie opens with Gerard dreaming of spiders consuming Christ , and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction . He chases offone man ( a boyfriend presumably ) , then chases another at a train station . Later , at a lecture , he meets a woman who seems to want to help him , orperhaps she has more nefarious plans .. She quickly captures Gerard in her web , enticing him with sex and money , having plenty of both . She 's also gotsecrets , like three dead husbands . Is she lonely , and genuinely looking for someone to nurture - or is she a deadly black widow , luring Gerard to hisdeath ? Will Garard be the 4th man she kills ? The woman is Christine ( Soutendijk ) , and Verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she 's up to.This is an interesting movie , with a lot of sex and intrigue . It 's similar to Verhoeven 's < em > Basic instinct < / em > , but has a lot more depth , and is certainly more shocking . There 's a lot of very strong gay content , which may make some viewers squirm .

" A meltdown at a nuclear power plant causes a majority of people to turn into lethal , rot-faced , shambling zombies who naturally go on a grisly rampage . A ragtag handful of uninfected folks do their best to survive this grueling ordeal . Director / co-writer / producer Todd Sheets displays an appealingly sincere love and passion for go-straight-for-the-throat lively and gruesome horror fare : he maintains an unflagging snappy pace throughout , fills the screen with wall-to-wall crazy action , and thankfully keeps the terrible dialogue to a pleasing minimum . Moreover , Sheets certainly doesn 't skimp on the gloriously graphic and excessive over-the-top splatter : this picture delivers a tasty truckload of flesh melting , evisceration , lots of gut munching , one dude has his heart yanked out , and there 's even a nice impalement on a tree branch . Sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end ( for example , almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie chow ) . Granted , this flick has its fair share of flaws : the ragged editing , several ham-fisted attempts at pathos , and the largely awful acting from a rank no-name cast all leave a good deal to be desired . Top thespic honors go to the pretty and perky Kasey Rausch for her winningly spunky portrayal of the resourceful Daria Trumillio . Frank Dunlay likewise does well as rugged take-charge army veteran Ralph Walsh . Best of all , Sheets ' sure grasp of an infectiously slambang sense of unrelenting headlong momentum and obvious affinity for the horror genre ensure that this remains a total blast to watch from start to finish . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Unfortunately , Jean Eustache ( 1938-1981 ) belongs like so many once leading French film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international DVDs . Since we have a good old-fashioned video-store in Tucson , I had the chance to watch this 3 1 / 2-hour marathon masterwork that is not boring for ten seconds.Since we speak here about one of the most discussed ( and most controversially discussed ) movies of all times , let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs , originally typical for the early " " Nouvelle Vague " " of a Jacques Rivette or Alain Resnais appear almost ridiculous in this movie . The dialogs are basically monologues , mainly the longest ones spoken by Jean-Pierre L챕aud . The most characteristic feature is that the intersections of the speeches of two people is almost zero . L챕aud , or his character , Alexandre , pleases to tell more about himself than about the topics he is seemingly to speak . Therefore , one can hardly speak about communication in this movie . It is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas , but the type of man Alexandre exists to all times , we find him already in Petron 's " " Satiricon " , " which work has actually great resemblance with " " The Mother and the Whore " . " Alexandre does not only nothing , but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting , at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is . He mocks at the people who run to work at 7 c 'clock in the morning , when he is just busy having his last drink before he goes to bed in the apartment of one of his girlfriends from whose money he lives . He is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between Nietzsche and Bernanos . Especially Sartre who is shown quickly in the French intellectual caf챕 " " Aux Deux Magots " , " where Alexandre , too , is sitting all day , must serve as excuse for the life-style of Alexandre and his colleagues , because they suffer existential crisis from bourgeois nausea . However , the intellectual speeches of Alexandre seem to be rather pseudo-intellectual , and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective books.It is true : This movie demands an extremely broad European knowledge , especially the connoisseurship of French existentialist philosophy and there consequences to the 68 student revolution movement , but if you have this knowledge , than you will enjoy 215 minutes of your life by staring amazed into the TV and crying out with laughing like you have probably not done it since a long time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've only watched the first series on DVD , but would summarise The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a Tarantino-like script . The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino , and almost as good as The Godfather ( hence not a " " 10 " " ) , and far better than any of Guy Ritchie 's efforts . Although there 's plenty of action , some of it pretty bloody , the story is character driven . Even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines ; e.g. the priest 's relationship ( or lack of ) with Carmilla and the restaurateur 's wife , and Christopher and his dimwit friend ( who didn 't last very long ( a Darwin Award nominee ? ) ) Apart from the plot , the script and the acting , the other reasons I liked it ; 1 . It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce . 2 . The music . 3 . It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" While Disney have been THE animation studio for the past 70 years , there have always been rivals to their supremacy . When this review was written in 2009 , for example , companies like Dreamworks and ( to a lesser extent ) Warner Brothers and Ardman , were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the Disney dominance . Back in the beginning , in that late ' 30s and early ' 40s heyday when Disney was serving cinematic banquets like Snow White , Dumbo and Fantasia , the competition was provided by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer . Despite releasing two very commendable films , they never quite cornered the market 혯 many attribute their downfall to the commercial failure of Mr Bug Goes To Town , released the same week as the attack on Pearl Harbour ( which gave the American public something more significant to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon ! ) That this film has faded into relative obscurity is a travesty.In a patch of overgrown garden in the city a bunch of bugs are in dire danger . Humans use the land as a shortcut , discarding litter and cigars , and other hazards , right on top of the bugs ' homes as they go . Honey-shop owner Mr Bumble ( voiced by Jack Mercer ) fears that the future is bleak , and wonders how he will ever be able to raise his daughter Honey ( voiced by Pauline Loth ) in more secure surroundings . A highly unscrupulous creature , Bagley C. Beetle ( voiced by Tedd Pierce ) , offers to provide her a safer place to live if she will accept his hand in marriage , but Honey is much more interested in her childhood sweetheart , the perennially cheerful and optimistic Hoppity ( voiced by Stan Freed ) . Hoppity believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better , but is left looking foolish when Bagley Beetle and his pair of comical sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own devious end . Only at the very end , as their patch becomes the foundation for a huge new skyscraper , do the bugs switch loyalty back to Hoppity as they look to him to lead them a new , safe home away from the destructive influence of humans.What really works in this film is the delightful characterisation 혯 all the bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal . The bumbling villains Swat the fly and Smack the mosquito ( hilarious names , if you stop to think about it ) are particularly memorable . Equally admirable is the storytelling drive 혯 even the youngest of children can enjoy this story , while at the same time it skillfully conveys a message for older audiences about the way human carelessness can impact upon the survival of wildlife . Time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film , and when viewing it the audience needs to accept ( and forgive ) these occasional signs of general age and wear . But on the whole Mr Bug Goes To Town is an accomplished , funny and very slickly presented animation with a worthy message to boot . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Shannon Lee , the daughter of Bruce Lee , delivers high kicking martial arts action in spades in this exhilarating Hong Kong movie and proves that like her late brother Brandon she is a real chip off the old block . There is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the Bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of the next 007 adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to bolster up the already high action content of " " AND NOW , YOU 'RE DEAD " . " When you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was created.I genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just marking time until the first kung fu movies made their debut . Bruce Lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring Shannon does not let the family name down here.Although there are several pleasing performances in this movie ( Michel Wong for one ) it is Shannon Lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as Mandy the hitgirl supreme.Hell ; you may well come away whistling her fights ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I watched the first series avidly , but wondered whether I 'd go back again after a lengthy break from it . However , I tuned into episode one of Series 2 and was hooked all over again . This really is excellent telly ; ground-breaking stuff like Mission : Impossible back in the 1960s . The characters are well rounded , and expand as the series goes on , they change as they adapt - some more readily than others - to their new surroundings , but they cleverly remain strictly in character , and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone whom you wouldn 't have thought you could ever feel sorry for , when something really crushing happens to them . I hope there will be many years of ' Lost ' to look forward to - and I don 't actually mind all that much if I never get answers to all the mysteries ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours , from primarily two points of view . The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable , because I know it happened in various places under occupation . Penelope Cruz played Pelagia , a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras ( Christian Bale ) . I had questions about the depth of their love from the start , but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece , and Mandras went off to fight . After German intervention , Greece is conquered and the island Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation , during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli ( Nicholas Cage . ) This , of course , was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands . As they got to know their occupiers , they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people , and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbours . I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain 's Channel Islands in which this was a major issue . Once Mandras returns to the island , Pelagia is torn between them.The second background issue is the Italian occupation itself , which I thought was quite realistically portrayed . First was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupiers . Greece defeated Italy ( quite true from a historical perspective ) and was really conquered by the Germans . The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened ( and was quite funny in fact . I loved the line , " " we would rather surrender to this German 's dog than to you Italians . " " ) The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as believable . The Italian Army was never enamoured of their German ally , and never enthusiastic about fighting with them . Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends , their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt . Here , the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting ( which the German troops on the island simply can 't understand , ) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the Germans . It was all quite well done , I thought.It falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish , but still deserves praise.7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Running Out of Time is probably as close to a perfect film as you 're ever likely to see out of Hong Kong . All the elements click : a terrific script ( by French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud ) that even manages to subvert the odd clich챕 , reliably imaginative direction by Johnnie To , and excellent central performances by Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan , the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody ( especially in his exasperated reactions to his superior 's abysmal negotiating skills ) . The supporting cast is fine too , with Yo Yo Mung making a strong impression in a tiny role , and even the often histrionic Waise Lee ( looking remarkably , and very aptly , like a bald Andy Lau ) reining it in to good effect . It 's best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic set-up 혯 with only a few weeks to live , Lau engages in a criminal game with Wan 's cop with no easily apparent motive 혯 and just sit back and enjoy the ride : it 's certainly worth the fare . It also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies , and played in a mere three scenes ( the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of film-making I 've seen in ages ) . There 's also a fine score by Raymond Wong as well . The most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it , but even more shocked by some of the comments I have read here . One person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of the torture was guilty or not--therefore ... One person wrote that since he wasn 't an American citizen , therefore ... Some people comment that the people in the Middle East hate us and want us dead , therefore ... So are we saying then that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime ? Are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an American Citizen ? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who may hate us and want us dead ? Are we saying that , as is written in the Geneva Convention , the Declaration of Human Rights and the Constitution of the United States that " " torture is wrong , but some torture is less wrong than others ? " " When does it become " " right " " to torture ? THAT is why this movie is powerful-- it is ambiguous , but not about torture . Torture is always wrong , and if we are willing to do it , even in the name of justice and " " National Security " " or " " freedom and democracy " " then we are wrong and we are evil ; we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing ( and we are calling them " " wrong " " in the same breath . ) My favorite line in the film was " " if you don 't want to compromise join Amnesty International .

" While escaping from a heist of a bank , the outlaw Vance Shaw ( Randolph Scott ) helps Edward Creighton ( Dean Jagger ) , the chief-engineer of the Western Union that is surveying the Wild West and had had an accident with a horse . In 1861 , Vance regenerates and is hired to work for the Western Union with the team that is installing the poles and cable from Omaha to Salt Lake City . Vance and the engineer from Harvard Richard Blake ( Robert Young ) flirt with the gorgeous Edward 's sister Sue Creighton ( Virginia Gilmore ) and she chooses Vance . However , his past haunts him when the outlaw Jack Slade ( Barton MacLane ) steals the Western Union cattle disguised of Indians . " " Western Union " " is a good but predictable western directed by Fritz Lang . The story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the West , facing thieves and Indians . The entertaining story has action , drama , romance and funny situations , but with the exception of the identity of Jack Slade , there is no surprise in the story .

" On a dark , gloomy New Year 's Eve night , an ill nurse , her life slowly ebbing away , demands that David Holm be presented to her at once . We don 't yet know who David Holm is , or why this nurse wishes to see him , but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time . On the other side of the town , nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery , Holm ( Victor Sj철str철m , who also directed ) and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the New Year . " " Here we can tell just when to drink the New Year in , " " exclaims Holm , casting a finger towards the large clock tower that looms through the darkness . Little does he know , however , that he will not be alive to greet it.To pass the time , Holm cheerfully recites a ghost story . He 'd once had a friend name George , " " a merry fellow " " who was " " smarter than the rest of us . " " On one New Year 's Eve several years ago , George has broken up a potentially disastrous brawl , fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year , doing Death 's bidding and collecting the souls of the deceased . " " And , gentlemen , George died last New Year 's Eve ! " " concludes Holm happily , not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man 's beliefs.As fate has it , of course , an unexpected violent encounter results in Holm 's death , just on the stroke of midnight . As the man 's transparent spirit rises gingerly from his earthly body , he witnesses , to his horror , the distant approach of a phantom carriage . The driver , a frail cloaked figure - a sickle clasped tightly in his hand - steps down from the carriage and approaches . We are astonished to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit George , preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year 's successor.Considering the era in which ' K철rkarlen ' is made , the special effects in this film are absolutely superb . Cinematographer Julius Jaenzon used double-exposure photography to create the eerie , ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damned driver . Even today , the end result is highly effective . A particularly impressive scene involves the phantom chariot travelling to the ocean floor to retrieve the soul of a drowned man . Another scene , eerily reminiscent of Jack Torrance ( Jack Nicholson ) in Stanley Kubrick 's ' The Shining , ' involves Holm breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children.Genuinely ominous and unsettling in its execution , Victor Sj철str철m 's ' K철rkarlen ' is a fine work of cinema , successfully portraying Holm 's steady alcoholic decline , his inevitable day of judgment , and a final hopeful possibility of redemption . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The 13th and last RKO Falcon film starts with the mutual injunction by Tom Conway as Tom Lawrence alias the Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie of " " No dames ! " " whilst they prepare to go on vacation . While you 're still wondering what they 're going on vacation from as they hadn 't had a job since the beginning of the 1st film in 1941 ( with Sanders as Gay though and Jenkins as Goldie ) they bump into a woman and get dragged into a seedy industrial espionage caper.They promise to help her when her uncle is murdered , by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to make substitute industrial diamonds to his business colleague in Miami . Suspect everyone here except the cops here who are after Lawrence 혯 and Goldie for the murder . To console himself Goldie keeps paraphrasing travel brochures : " " On the coldest day you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cosy electric chair " " for one . Some nice languid atmospheric nightclub scenes rub shoulders with some especially bad behaviour from the baddies . Favourite bit : the dignified game of hide and seek / hunt the thimble the imperturbable and suave Lawrence has with the baddies on the sleeper train . Least favourite bit : the most embarrassing scene in the entire series in the alligator wrestling hut 혯 definitely thrown in for the kids ! All in all not the best in the series but yet another entertaining outing , with an overall satisfying plot and many episodes even in this that make me wish they could have gone on for just a few more years as Columbia did with Boston Blackie , although RKO were churning these out faster . Absolutely no sex , not much violence ( in fact none at all by today 's high standards ) , and positively no message all make this type of film anathema to serious people who can only regard movies as an art form that must depend on these three pillars.Three Diet Falcon 's were made later with John Calvert in the title role , I don 't mind them but could never bring myself to count them into the main series , which Tom Conway had made his own by this time . Sad also that it was all downhill after this for Conway , who moved into TV , voice overs and even played Norman Conquest in Park Plaza 605 rather well in 1953 . He also developed serious eye and alcohol problems 혯 I don 't know if they were linked 혯 wound up poverty stricken and after a spell in hospital in 1967 was found dead in his girlfriend 's bed .

" This is a very visual film . By that I mean that the dialog is sparse , almost to the point of being a silent movie for some very long takes , beginning with the opening shot.The silences , however , are broken by a stunning sound track that ranges from discordant , staccato beats to a haunting mix of violins , and interspersed with vocals that sound like dreams . It 's a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes , one of the early visuals being a man walking along a street , so preoccupied with his interest in a shapely woman , that he walks into a lamppost : one of the consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in store ... A long time ago , another movie 혯 Love Story ( 1970 ) -- said that love is never having to say you 're sorry . This narrative turns that idea on its head in a number of ways , beginning with the main character , Titta ( Toni Sevillo ) , a seemingly innocuous long-term resident in a plush hotel somewhere in Switzerland . Everyday , week in , week out , he sits at the same coffee table , enjoying the passing world , his cigarettes , his coffee , his solitude 혯 and he 's been doing it for ten years . He sits , he observes , and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that you 'll find out about when you see this little masterpiece ... Love is explored in another way , in a direct counterpoint to Titta 's solitude and reserved nature : two older residents of the hotel are still much in love , but the man wants to die in a spectacular manner when his time comes , while his long suffering wife berates him for cheating at cards with the other guests , one of whom is Titta . Now , Titta knows about their squabbles , their love , the man 's cheating , his apologies to his wife , and his whining . How ? In a surprising and black-comedic manner ... one of those surprise activities I mentioned.But , this is no comedy , in reality , although it does touch upon the idea of the human comedy in a Balzacian sense : the irony of life and what to do with it . That decision had been made for Titta ten years earlier when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel . He keeps in touch occasionally , and it is clear that he still loves his children ( now grown up ) and the sorrow in his voice speaks volumes . But , there 's something more than just sorrow ... Such a life as Titta 's would obviously seem to be utterly boring , and it actually is from many perspectives . It is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost death-like countenance , however , that the horror of his situation hits the viewer between the eyes . But not before we know that the female bartender , Sofia ( Olivia Magnani ) , is very interested in Titta and goes out of her way to pique Titta 's interest in her.And that 's when things start to unravel for Titta : he eventually succumbs to her femininity and in doing so discovers , once again , the consequences of love . Ironically , in doing so , he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life , and in a most spectacular fashion.I know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic ; but , to say more would spoil the film and story for you . If you like Italian cinema 혯 I love it ! 혯 I urge you to see this one . The acting is superb ; the sound track chills the spine ; the camera work is truly innovative ; the direction shows the maturity of a true artist.I know I 'll see this movie again , and again ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I like this film a lot . It has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is pretty universal , the story of the prodigal son . The aspect I like the best however was the way that the bath house was more than just a background for the story . As the father told the son the story of his wife 's family in the northern deserts of china , the element of water and bathing becomes an almost sacred ritual . Water was so scarce that a simple bath had profound depth and meaning.Overall the film was very effective . There were moments , however , when it verged on " " too " " sweet ... bordering on cloying during the park recital scene . But overall , I highly recommend this film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I remember being terrified of movie blood when I was younger , and gradually getting less so , until getting jaded enough , as I 'm sure many other viewers have become , so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm . " " The Dentist " " turned that around.The setup seems simple : a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths , and perhaps bodies as well . A clever twist , though , is that the dentist is the film 's protagonist , so instead of being some one-dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation , his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable . The viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims , and instead of hoping for justice to come to him , I found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life.What really " " makes " " a horror movie is the violence . And " " The Dentist " " does it better than any other film I can think of . First off , the film has tons of tension , which is something that modern gore films tend to lack . In one scene ( ) , the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time . As he reaches into the child 's mouth , you hope that , for the dentist 's and the child 's sake , the encounter ends without injury . I won 't spoil what happens . Second , when the gore does come , it hits all the worst , squirmy nerves . Once again , I won 't give anything away.Of course , being a movie that you 've never heard of , it does have flaws . Most importantly , it 's exclusively for horror fans . Also , as another reviewer mentioned , by taking place over a span of just a few days , we don 't really get any background on the characters . And the tension drops a little bit during the very end . But really , the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is , and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgiven.It 's strange , after years of being accustomed to movie gore , to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood . " " The Dentist " " made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable , and for this it earns my full approval . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I caught this film at a test screening . Was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story . Well acted . Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts . The male lead was awsome . Very funny film . Takes place in the best locations in New York . Made me want to go there . I just saw " " You 've got mail " " I thought " " It Had To Be You ' was a much better story . Fresher.It was clean and great for whole family . I think it will do well . Audience I saw it with loved it . A definite recommend ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This great film never showed up in my town , so actually I didn 't have any opportunity to watch it until the late 80'es when I caught it on German television . I was expecting something of a disaster , and found instead a well-acted grand western with superb location work . The tiny tube couldn 't really damage it and there 's almost not a dull moment in this 4-hour film , so I hope to see it once again on the big screen . What a spectacle that would be ! Don 't miss it , if you ever have the chance . Unfortunately the harsh treatment of " " Heaven 's Gate " " at its opening ruined Michael Cimino 's career and he moved from the passable ( " " Year of the Dragon " " ) to the boringly ludicrous ( " " The Sicilian " " ) and the screechingly dumb ( " " Desperate Hours " " ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This little-known comedy from the hit play by Ruth Gordon is a delight . The script , based on the play , is spicy , rich , and completely undated . Ditto the cast but I must underline the work of the leading lady , Irene Dunne . Irene is simply superb - as usual - and lights up the screen with every frame she 's in ( and she 's in it a lot , thank heaven ) . In addition , director Vidor has given her some unusual close-ups that are mesmerizing . What a gal ! I know of no other Hollywood actress from any era who has her versatility and is so convincing in every film . Why she remains so little known is a mystery . I have seen most of her films and this one was a surprise , even for a solid ID fan like myself . See it , everyone ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In " " Hoot " , " a new kid arrives to Florida from Montana . He first faces the usual problems of blending in and dealing with the local bully . Soon , though , he becomes aware of a bigger problem : a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town , right where a number of burrowing owls live . This movie has the look of a family film , but it is pretty more radical than it seems , as it shows sympathetically how Roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from lawbreaking ( including vandalism of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of restaurants ) in the name of environmentalism ( to save owls , no less ) . Now , one might agree or not with those actions , but at least the movie has the courage from not shying away from its convictions . A good , solid film , all in all . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I read about this film on-line and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received , and viewing the trailer , I decided to check it out for myself . What a disappointment ! It starts out well enough. the opening scene was actually pretty tense , but from there it 's all downhill . I can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie , but by doing so , they took all the enjoyment out of watching it . Those choices combined with the " " C.S.I " " editing , use of music and montage , lack of suspense , scares , or humor really drag this film down . There 's too much foreshadowing and to many " " subtle " " clues , so when the first twist arrives early on , you already know how the movie is going to end . I gave the movie three stars because I think the cast did a good job , other than that I can 't recommend this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it . The acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot . As a French " " Noir " " film , its language is certainly a lot earthier than its American counterparts , but to me this just added to the realism . Additionally , I liked how non-glamorous everyone was--particularly the husband and the lieutenant . About the only negative , and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10 , is because there was a glaring plot hole . Like another famous French film , Dr척le de Drame , the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning , but the characters made rather stupid decisions . For this , you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching--the payoff is well worth the wait.This is simply one of the finest French films I have seen . Period . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In 1965 producer Kevin McLory -who owns a part of the Bond cinematic rights- associate with EON Productions ( Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli ) for making " " Thunderball " , " the fourth film of the 007 franchise . The star is Sean Connery , of course.In 1982 McLory wins a legal battle and can produce an " " independent " " Bond film . " " Never say never again " " ( NSNA ) is one of the two " " unofficial " " 007 films made outside EON ( the other is the 1967 comedy spoof " " Casino Royale " " ) . NSNA is a remake of " " Thunderball " " and stars the original Bond , Sean Connery -who comes back to the role after many years of absence.The film is released some months after " " Octopussy " " with Roger Moore , the 13th episode of the EON series . At the time press calls it " " War of the Bonds " ... " Both films are a big success in 1983 , even if " " Octopussy " " earns more money at the box office.NSNA is a luxurious film made by excellent technicians -director Irvin Kershner who led " " The Empire strikes back " , " Douglas Slocombe -cinematographer of " " Raiders of the lost Ark " " - , and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr -who wrote " " The three days of the Condor " " - among others ... The cast is excellent with Connery , a then relatively unknown Kim Basinger , Barbara Carrera , Klaus Maria Brandauer , Max Von Sydow , Edward Fox ... Although all that the film remains inferior to the original " " Thunderball " . " It lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real Bond movie : there 's not the traditional gun barrel sequence , there 's not the " " James Bond theme " , " M and Q are not played by the traditional actors ... It 's a copyright reason : EON only is allowed to use these elements . Briefly , NSNA lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere.On the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable . Brandauer is a very good villain and the women ( Basinger and Carrera ) are sensual and gorgeous . But the main highlight is Sean Connery ! He 's once again wonderful in the role , he 's older but looks fitter and nicer here than in " " Diamonds are forever " , " his last performance in the role of the British super-spy before NSNA . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a totally delightful and unexpected film . You start by following a young person who hopes to get into the qualifying football game between Bahrain and Iran . If Iran win they will get into the 2006 World Cup in Germany . The problem is the young person is a girl and girls ( or women for that matter ) are not allowed into football matches to " " sit with men " . " What follows is a wonderful comedy , played with consummate skill by a small ensemble cast . The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on the freedom of women ( and for that matter the young soldiers who have to corral them ) . There are some excellent set pieces , not least when one of the girls must go to the toilet and , of course , the stadium has no toilets for women . The camera work is of the simplest and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage play . Yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite . Great cinema ? No , probably not ; great entertainment - for sure . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's sad to view this film now that we know how the ANC got shafted by international capitalism . Biko died for nothing much . Woods achieved little . Yes , outright apartheid was abolished , but all the apparatus of power was reserved by the minority whites , leaving the ANC government more or less impotent . As Naomi Klein writes in The Shock Doctrine , in the talks between the black and white leaderships " " the deKlerk government had a twofold strategy . First drawing on the ascendant Washington Consensus that there was no only one way to run an economy , it portrayed key sectors of economic decision making --- such as trade policy and the central bank --- as " " technical " " or " " adminsitrative " . " Then it used a wide range of new policy tools --- international trade agreements , innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs --- to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts , economists and officials from the IMF , the World Bank , the GATT and the National Party --- anyone except the liberation fighters from the ANC . " " The statistical results are horrifying , with not much change accomplished , and AIDS flourishing . Viewing Cry Freedom in this light is deeply ironic --- actually tragic . The ANC has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A young woman comes to the home town of his husband after he passed away in an accident . She barely settles down in this small town , but shortly after , loses her little son in a kidnapping and all her hopes ... This could lead to all kinds following plots in a normal movie : find a new partner and being happy finally ; or depressed enough to struggle and finally kill herself ... She does try to kill herself , but not after a series of severe fights , with God . She trusts in God , only to find that God seems to forgive everyone , even the killer . Well , I should be careful here about God , the movie doesn 't mean a thing against God . The way the movie deals the issue is quite interesting : not in the woman 's point of view or from God 's perspective ( in this way , there would be lots of grass growing , clouds flying views , I suppose ) . Rather , it 's from a third party 's eye , the movie let us to perceive and doesn 't explain a thing.The movie wouldn 't be so interesting were there only the woman . There 's this man who 's everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her , but in his own way . He 's a funny guy , like a clown I should say , who shamelessly hangs around our heroine . The combination of these two , the woman full of tension , crying and throwing up always , and the man , smiling and talking stupidly , ends up in a good balance of emotions : nothing absurdly wrong or too tedious.Highly recommend . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Reviewed at the Sept 12 , 2006 2nd screening at the Paramount 1 theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival . The film had World Premiered the day before at the Elgin Theatre VISA Screening Room.The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him , but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc . The downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain DVD bins and his being chauffeured by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops Freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager . He soon discovers the real-life market is run by a iron-willed " " 10 Items or Less " " checkout line clerk played by Paz Vega . When Freeman 's ride never returns and Vega needs help in prepping for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get Freeman back home and to get Vega a job that 'll get her on a more upwardly mobile career path.While the film was enjoyable , it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress . There were two extended musical sequences ( One with Vega & Freeman teaching each other children 's songs in the car , one that literally plays like a Paul Simon music video ) that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long.It 's a good thing Morgan Freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little . Sure it was funny in parts and Paz Vega is a delight as well , but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete film.They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and Paz Vega said she never does that . Who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no ! ? In the real world it 's the exact opposite.Make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits . The bit with a Target Store saleslady teaching Morgan Freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious ! An early bit where Freeman 's chauffeur insists it is Freeman 's voice on a " " Books on Tape " " reading was also pretty funny.The director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a brief Q & A after the screening . Silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there . Quite a compliment for both Silberling 's writing and also about how Freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" L 'Appartement is , I think , a very purposeful Hitchcockian film . The plot was rife with symbolism ( ie the white and red roses ) and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly .

" Only the Brits could make a film like this and have it be so tastefully charming ! Betty ( Brenda Blethyn ) wants something more out of life , but she doesn 't know what , when she realizes she is in love with her childhood friend , Boris ( Alfred Molina ) , who owns the local funeral parlor . Meanwhile , an American mortician ( Christopher Walken ) who " " wants to put the ' fun ' back in funerals " " moves into this small Welsh community with his assistant ( Lee Evans ) and wants to give Boris a run for his money with flashy , themed funerals .

" If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared , Death in Venice would have to be it . It is a monument in movie history . Much criticized for being slow , boring and too obvious in stating it 's point ( an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed , first mentally , then physically ) , we should appreciate this movie for what it is . ' Morte a Venezia ' was shot over 30 years ago , and it portrays a period even further back , at the beginning of the twentieth century.Life was slow then , compared to now . People were supposed to behave in a certain way , hiding their true emotions even from themselves . Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde , the leading actor , admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy . For a man like Von Aschenbach , in his time , this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with . We see his inner struggle , mostly on the face of Bogarde , against the beautiful backdrop of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music , composed by Gustav Mahler.This movie is slow , there is no denying it . No special effects , car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats . No perverted sex scenes either ; the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile.So , basically , nothing much happens in this movie ? Not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum . If you want them to be played like the strings of a violin in a romantic concerto , this is the movie to do it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth , but Herzog does an amazingly good job . The movie 's point is to show human beings , and even the world , from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts : Creation , Paradise , and The Golden Age . The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over . Although the text of ' The Creation ' ( from the Popol Vuh , a Mayan myth ) refers to the primordial wasteland , the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth . It dwells on the waste , and on various specimens of destruction ( fire , smoke , wrecked vehicles ) . The images from ' Paradise ' are anything but that , and ' The Golden Age ' is darkly comic 혯 the highest culture is the strange roadside musical act.The Popol Vuh suggests that mankind is the central object of creation , but the movie does everything it can to undo this notion . Its mythological framework has no referent in human historical time . There are no human characters to speak of . When a boy stands with a dog in an extended shot , the initial suggestion is of the boy 's point of view ; by the end it is much more the dog 's . Likewise the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it , and the turtle 's partner barely looks human with his big flippers.Animal stories and nature documentaries always anthropomorphize , but Fata Morgana has none of that . Certainly the dunes look like a female body , but the simile cuts both ways . Presumably only humans can distinguish easily between their creation and nature , and here airplanes and factories are presented alongside mountains , lakes , and waterfalls . People and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscape.In 1979 Herzog put a new twist on the idea when he remade Nosferatu from the vampire 's point of view . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Holy crap this is so hysterical ! Why aren 't American comedies written like this ? For anybody who thinks comedy has to be dumb-- there is more wit and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a shelf of novels ! Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot . I couldn 't believe it was the same guy as House ! There are so many great lines and gags in this series you could watch each show dozens of times and still pick up on new things each time . Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and put upon butler Edmund . This is my favorite of all the Blackadder series . And Tony Robinson is wonderful as ever as the somewhat obtuse heart of the series , " " the oppressed mass " " Baldrick .

" This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything . She and her son , who just recently returned from Vietnam collide in some very tense issues . The relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues . Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty , forgetful or just doesn 't want to be confronted . Jeremy 's wrath is never feared and it leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers love for him .

" Most people miss Hollywood 's point of concept . If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child , within the confines of the law then I , approve of the lessons being taught by Doc Savage.In all times of conflict or war , the public and government look for heroes to decorate . The motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with - such as Doc Savage , James Bond , Superman , Batman , Spiderman and others . Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the ' best of the best ' before James Bond , Superman or any of the others . All others that follow Doc Savage are only a part of the character , not the ' Man of Bronze ' . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil.Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry . I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.By the way to all we westerners , Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like ' Devdas ' to the Oscars ? That was a really a Masochist move . I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges toppled Lagaan last year . ' Devdas ' is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of Love , fate and destiny . I would keep away from it . Anyway , not sending a movie like Kanathil Muthital shows how much of a revamp Indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence . Now I know why this country has so many issues . They are heavily talented but not showcased properly . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie would had worked much better if this was the first Critters movie , this is a low-budget movie with only two ( 2 ) Critters shown on-screen . Why this looks like a fail is because this is the last Critters movie and it 's so low-budget that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money . However , I did like this movie , I compare it mostly with the third movie ( which were bad ) . Critters 4 have a more serious tone in it , the first half of the movie ( even without seeing one Critter yet ) you have a scary feeling watching it , too bad they didn 't " " milk " " out the Critters , I mean even if they only had two ( 2 ) puppets they could still have used them on-screen a lot more . The Critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special , especially at the end with the frozen Critter . Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise . Lastly I liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series , so at least we won 't see a Critters 5 anymore . Oh , one last thing , I missed one scene in this movie , we never see a Critter shoot a spike from its back , maybe these puppets didn 't have that feature , but I was very disappointed not seeing that ( in Critters 3 we see a lot of spike shooting , which was the only good thing I liked about that movie ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I totally got drawn into this and couldn 't wait for each episode . The acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be , together with the effects it would have on those closest .

Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go along with it ? Having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion . I have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either . Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ? ? ? ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I see alot of movies at the cinema ( 103 so far this year ) and I have to say that this is by far and away the best film I have seen this year , even though it was released back in 1954 ! I sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that I had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print . The best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music , merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist . Pure quality . Although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humour.Not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort ! ! If you ever get a chance to see this movie , please do not hesitate , it 's a classic . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Favela Rising is a documentary about the slums of Rio , the favelas , specifically the most violent one , Vig찼rio Geral . According to this film , a lot more kids have died violently in Rio 's favelas over the last decade or so than in Israel / Palestine during the same period -- a fact astonishing if true , which shows how under-recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world . This is an important topic , especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to marshal the neediest and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program . This is a compelling documentary , if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personality-based version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examined.Drug lords rule in the favelas and gun-toting teenage boys are the main drug dealers , like in parts of Colombia . Fernando Meirelles ' movie City of God / Cidade de Deus has been accused of celebrating violence ( Cidade de Deus is another of Rio 's many favelas ) . But the early section of Favela Rising shows that in fact favela boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are . It 's cool to carry a gun there , cool to work as a drug trafficker : it 's fifty times more profitable than the earnings available by other means.Mochary first discovered the AfroReggae movement and its leaders Anderson S찼 and Jos챕 Junior while visiting Rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor Zimbalist to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to fund it . S찼 's eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator , but like the favelas themselves the film teems with other people . No doubt about the fact that S찼 is a remarkable leader , organizer , and artist.Vig찼rio Geral is compared to Bosnia : shooting there was very dangerous . Anderson S찼 's friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting enabled the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while ( mostly : there were close calls ) avoiding any serious confrontations with drug lords or drug-dealing cops . They also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home . That resulted in 10 % of the footage , including rare shots of violent incidents including police beatings . It 's hard for an outsider to keep track of police massacres in Rio . There was one in the early 1990 's that looms over the story and inspired S찼 , who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement . The cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody doesn 't like that the ill trained police paramilitaries come in ( often wearing black ski masks ) and shoot up a neighborhood , killing a lot of innocents.This is pretty much the picture we get in Meirelles ' City of God , except that this time S찼 , Junior , and the other guys come in , starting in Vig찼rio Geral but spreading out eventually to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth -- girls as well as boys . Their AfroReggae ( Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR ) program , formed in 1993 , is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the Rio ghettos . It leads them to leave behind smoking , alcohol , and drugs ( that 's the rule ) to explode into rap , song , percussion , and gymnastics in expressive , galvanic performances . Eventually the best of the performers led by S찼 wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers , and their Banda AfroReggae has an international recording contract.Other centers and groups have been created by or through the GCAR over the years in Vig찼rio Geral and other favelas to seek the betterment of youth by providing training and staging performances of music , capoeira , theater , hiphop and dance at GCAR centers.The performance arts aren 't everything , just the focal point . GCAR is also a movement for broader social change Gathering public awareness through such performances , the centers also provide training in information ( newspaper , radio , Internet , e-mail links ) , hygiene and sex education , to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor , black and white , and to offer workshops in audio-visual work , including production of documentaries . The program is currently active in four other favelas.There are many scenes of favela street and home life in Favela Rising and they look very much like the images in City of God with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very , very much more positive . Not that it isn 't an uphill battle . And the corruption of the police , the inequities of the social system , and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not directly addressed by any of this . But there 's a scene where S찼 talks to some young kids in another favela , cynical boys not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and determined to work in the drug trade as S찼 himself did as a boy .

" ( SPOILERS included ) This film surely is the best Amicus production I 've seen so far ( even though I still have quite a few to check out ) . The House that Dripped Blood is a horror-omnibus혚an anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious , hellish house in the British countryside . A common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate tales혚Peter Duffel 's film wisely doesn 't pay too much attention to that . It simply handles about a Scotland Yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that , he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before . All four stories in this film are of high quality-level and together , they make a perfect wholesome . High expectations are allowed for this film , since it was entirely written by Robert Bloch ! Yes , the same Bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone ' Psycho '혚 We 're also marking Peter Duffel 's solid and very professional debut as a director . The four stories 혯 chapters if you will 혯 in the House that Dripped Blood contain a good diversity in topics , but they 're ( almost ) equally chilling and eerie . Number one handles about a horror-author who comes to the house , along with his wife , in order to find inspiration for his new book . This starts out real well , but after a short while , his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination . The idea in this tale isn 't exactly original혚but it 's very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising . The second story stars ( Hammer ) horror-legend Peter Cushing as a retired stockbroker . Still haunted by the image of an unreachable and long-lost love , he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her . Cushing is a joy to observe as always and 혯 even though the topic of Wax Museums isn 't new 혯 this story looks overall fresh and innovating . This chapter also contains a couple of delightful shock-moments and there 's a constant tense atmosphere . It 's a terrific warm-up for what is arguably the BEST story : number 3 . Another legendary actor in this one , as Christopher Lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father . He 's very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world . Not without reason , since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo . Besides great acting by Lee and the remarkable performance of Chloe Franks as the spooky kid , this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere ! The devilish undertones in this story , along with the creepy sound effects of thunder , make this story a must for fans of authentic horror . The fourth and final story , in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire-cloak he wears , is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility , but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that . There 's even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co-star Christopher Lee in the Dracula series ! Most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous Ingrid Pitt ! The cult-queen from ' The Vampire Lovers ' certainly is one of the many highlights in the film혚her cleavage in particular . No doubt about it혚The House that Dripped Blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans . I truly believe that , with a bit of mood-settling preparations , this could actually be one of the few movies that 'll terrify you and leave a big impression . Intelligent and compelling horror like it should be ! Highly recommended . One extra little remark , though : this film may not혚repeat MAY NOT under any circumstances be confused with ' The Dorm that Dripped Blood ' . This latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80 's slasher that has got nothing in common with this film , except for the title it stole . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Never have i sat down for six hours straight to watch a miniseries , but Changi changed that . I 'm not going to lie , I know some Aussie flicks can be pathetic and boring ( actually , i quite like Aussie flicks myself but maybe I 'm biased ) but Changi is on a completely different lane . Although not historically accurate , as we are continually reminded , the show combines superb acting , an excellent script and the addition of humour to provide us with an entertaining and emotional perception of life in a POW camp in WWII.Keep in mind , the show was not supposed to be a documentary so don 't let any factual errors disappoint you . This series exposes such creative writing by John Doyle ( aka Roy Slaven ) who is known more for his comedy than anything else , and an excellent director and actors move this creativity along perfectly . If you want to see how much hard work went into this series , visit the official website , it is really interesting and you 'll learn a lot about true accounts of changi . If you haven 't seen Changi yet , make sure you are doing nothing for a whole day because you 'll want to watch the series in its entirety . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" It 's quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be simultaneously so insightful about gay & bi-sexual relationships , and their struggles ! " " Pool Days " " is about the awkwardness of adolescence , and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one . A story about experience and vulnerability ! " " A Friend Of Dorothy " " portrays a common dilemma many gay and bi-sexual people experience at some point in their life : the intense attraction towards someone whom is heterosexual . Sensitively examined , this story truly left me feeling moved ! " " The Disco Years " " shows another version of a no-win situation : getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation , but is also terrified of being exposed as anything other than straight ! A very empowering story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person ! While these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy towards others , they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay , bi-sexual or searching . Each story is uplifting in its own unique way ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I agree whole-heartedly with the comments so far . I remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative I 've ever seen .

Not only was the story of the colony incredible , but I remember the music as being so much a part of it 's appeal . If I remember correctly , it was Native Americn pipes ( akin to the music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo 's Nest ) . I , too have been looking for a copy .

" On its surface , this is one of the most classically entertaining action / comedy / romance films I 've seen in a long time , reminding me of pleasurable old " " Saturday-afternoon " " movies that had just the right balance of unexpected twists , well-timed humor and integrated action . Beyond this , though , there is our knowledge of this film 's context . It has the same elements of " " Casablanca , " " but is set just before many of the characters would truly understand the seriousness of what was happening to their country ( and the world ) and the consequences of some of their own behavior . This adds a strong note of irony to the humor ( we sense that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in her future ) . This is a film that you will not regret watching . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch .

" After waiting years for a definitive collection of Led Zeppelin perfomances on video , fans have finally been rewarded with what is undoubtedly the greatest concert video ever ! Much better than the dismal " " Song Remains the Same " , " this video includes performances from no less than 5 different venues spanning a decade . It also includes rare interviews and TV appearances . The sound quality is amazing , considering the source material used . And the video quality is even more impressive .

" This short is one of the best of all time and is proof ( just like most of Charlie Chaplin 's work ) that sound and color are not requirements for quality work . In fact , this cartoon uses ( and may have started ) some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years , like caricatures of celebrities ( including the afore-mentioned Chaplin . While the characters are silent , they do " " speak " , " by use of word balloons , just like in the comics . Given that Felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip , this device is a natural . The atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension ( literally and figuratively ) and makes this short a delight to watch . Well worth taking the time and effort to get . Most highly recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am decidedly not in the target audience for this film . I am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film . This happened quite by accident , with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television . The first two things I noticed about that film were that it was 1 ) technically amateurish and 2 ) brilliantly written . When I read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks , I started to get interesting . When he said his main influence was The Station Agent , a movie I 'd seen on DVD a week prior , I decided I had to go and check it out . The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks , although the two films are nothing alike content wise . Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing . Whereas Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation , Less Like Me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy , he 's always running one way or another , filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones . The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant . I can tell from watching it that not much has changed since I was growing up , young men still have the same problems they always have . The writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular , crafts wonderfully honest characters , and has them do completely believable things . As far as indie cinema goes , this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint , but from an artistic one , it is very close . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Rookie is based on the true story of a 40 + year old school teacher in Big Lake , Texas reaching the majors . Jimmy Morris ( Dennis Quaid ) is a small-town high school science teacher and baseball coach . His team is losing terribly until the team discovers that their coach played in minor leagues and can throw a pitch 98 mph . After throwing batting practice and a wager is made , Jim agrees that if his team wins regional 's , he 'll try out for the Major Leagues . The movie tells the story from Jimmy being boy to playing in his first game in the majors . It is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie . Dennis Quaid makes the movie worth while , giving an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent supporting cast which includes : Brian Cox , Rachel Griffiths , and Angus T. Jones . The story takes a little while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow but it all works in well by the end . The baseball scenes are fun , well-filmed , and portrayed excellently . The movie really isn 't about baseball but about one man 's quest to reach his dream . It 's inspiring , it 's emotional , and it 's funny . I liked it , I hope you do.The Rookie .

" Plankton , or Creatures from the Abyss as I 'm positive it 's more commonly known as & filmed under as the title Creatures from the Abyss appears over a moving image & in the same font type as the rest of the credits , starts with five 20 something kids , Mike ( Clay Rogers ) his girlfriend Margaret ( Sharon Twomey ) , sisters Julie ( Ann Wolf ) & Dorothy ( Loren DePalm ) & an annoying idiot named Bobby ( Michael Bon ) whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat & head out to sea , don 't ask why as I don 't know . Oh & the complete idiot Bobby left the petrol behind & never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any petrol for the motor & to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm & discover a dead body floating in the water . Shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht & potential safety , in a flash everyone boards the yacht & begin to explore . First of all they find a scientific lab with various fish specimens & computer equipment , then down below they find fully furnished & luxurious cabins . They find a chemist ( Deran Sarafian ) who appears mad & can 't talk . They eat fish from the fridge which makes Dorothy puke up green vomit , beetles & slugs . They learn that these fish are living fossil 's 1000 's of years old & have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea & that they fly , mutate , bite & are generally unpleasant to be around . I really can 't be bothered to go on with this plot outline so I won 't , here 's what I think ... This Italian production was produced & directed by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri ( I 'd hide under a different name if I made a film this bad too ) & I think Plankton is quite simply one of the worst films ever , there are so many things wrong with this film it 's difficult to know where to start . First the script by Richard Baumann is total crap , it makes no sense whatsoever & is so slow & dull it was torture for me to sit through . Why would five people just simply set sail for the middle of the ocean on a rubber dinghy barely big enough to fit them all in ? What were they planning on doing exactly ? Why do we often get point-of-view shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character , & how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in ? People 's actions & reactions to things are all wrong , they constantly split up , they make bizarre decisions that simply don 't make any sense in the situation they find themselves in & some of the dialogue is as awful as anything I 've heard . I could go on all day about all the plot holes & ridiculous goings on but I 'll run out of space if I do . The fish creatures themselves look awful , a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets & some really bad stop motion animation at the end , the scenes where they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad super imposition . I have heard a lot of comments saying that Plankton is gory , don 't make me laugh ! Forget it there is virtually no blood or gore in Plankton whatsoever , there are a couple of slimy scenes when Bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with Julie but it 's pretty brief & he doesn 't kill her , he just sort of drips slime on her , grows a couple of tentacles & a fish head comes out of his mouth . Later on Julie 's vagina starts to drip some dark slime but that 's it , we never get to actually see what happens to her or what the slime is . Dorothy has a fish creature come out of her back , off screen , & control her but again we never get to see what happens to her while Margaret commits suicide , a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead . Easily the grossest scene is when Dorothy pukes up that green stuff with what looks like beetles & slugs in it . That 's it , only one person actually dies on screen & for the most part Plankton is quite tame & as exciting as watching paint dry & I nearly fell asleep it 's so boring . I can 't see how anybody can like this total crap , I just can 't . The acting is awful , the dubbing is awful , the characters are awful & I hated all of them . Tecnically Plankton is predictably crap as well , with an estimated budget of only $ 250,000 all I can say is where did the money go ? The sets are monotonous & dull with one lab & a few cabins , the special effect 's are bottom of the barrel stuff including the most fake looking exploding boat ever , the cinematography is bland , the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension & as a whole Plankton , like it 's name sake , is as low in the food chain as it could possibly be . I hate Plankton , it 's awful in every single aspect of it 's overlong 86 minute duration . Do yourself a favour & avoid this one at all costs unless your either a masochist or insomniac . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I got this as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs . I knew nothing about the history of the series . Season 1 of the series has the pilot episode as episode 1 and then 3 more episodes for a total of 4 . Season 2 lists 5 episodes with the last being Beyond Good and Evil with an original Air Date of 7 December 1998 . The other 4 episodes on season 2 were broadcast from December 1997 to Febrausry 1998 . So Beyond Good and Evil looks like season 3 episode 1 , except there are no more episodes in season 3.Spoilers here . The two main characters of the first 8 episodes , Dr. Iain McCallum ( John Hannah ) and Dr. Angela Moloney ( Zara Turner ) , are missing from this episode being replaced by Dr. Dan Gallagher ( Nathaniel Parker ) and Dr. Charley Fielding ( Eva Pope ) . I recognized Nathaniel Parker from the series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries , which began in 2001 . So they were planning to have a season 3 but only one episode was broadcast.It seems odd to try to continue a series named after the main character , McCallum , when the main character is gone from the series . So they might have been planning a return of Dr. Iain McCallum , but when that failed the series was canceled . I have no inside information on this but I do see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker were involved in other projects in 1999 . Does anyone have any information on this ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to put him to death and then bring him back to life so that he can prove that there is an afterlife . So they do and soon enough all of the medical students want to know if there is life after death . The afterlife isn 't about pearly gates and lights at the end of the tunnel but something more sinister.Past ghosts come back to haunt them and surely this movie will haunt anyone . It has some pretty scary moments that could translate into real life and it makes people wonder somewhat about what happens when you die .

" My first Mamin film , saw it on IFC long ago , and LOVED it . It seemed absolutely artistic , original , fun and hilarious . Not a moment in the film let me down or made me bored , and i was laughing a lot or had a smile on my face . I mean this movie is truly funny . But here 's the catch : it 's also very artistic and creative - if you don 't know Yuri Mamin ( probably , sadly , because so many of his GREAT films aren 't available here ) he has a very original style like no one else 's , and for me this isn 't even my favorite film of his ( right now it 's the insane ( " " Saideburns / Bakenbardy " " ) . Also , i have to say as a Russian , this film is great because you really do see what Russians are like . And this is possible because this is a true Russian film to me , NOT a foreign film trying to be American or trying to appeal ; Mamin did not sell out ( nor has he since , Gorko ( 1998 ) was as good if not better . This is true Russian style filmaking that came out of communist Social realism.If you liked this film , i think you have a very high chance of loving Mamin 's other films , in fact i like quite a few of them more than this one . I guess this one is his most accessible film . A similar film is Fountain , taking place 6 years before during perestroika , it has the same actor in the leading role , and more of Mamin 's regulars who you will recognize from Window to Paris ; this one has one supernatural twist in the end but is mostly a realistic comedy , a great one . Viva Mamin , hopefully Criterion will hook all of his movies up one day , he 's still working , and his catalog is so great ! See any of his films if you can . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" when i first started watching these it became one of my favourite shows . Melissa Joan hart is very funny and talented so were the aunts and the other characters and the star of of the show Salem the cat , he was immensely funny. the first few season in my opinion were the best where Sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting to witch life. they were most funniest , most entertaining and most um ... good. i 'm not a fan of when they started introducing Brad and Dreamer cause i quite liked Valerie , but they were okay the problem was they were only in it for one season. if you 're gonna have new people at least keep them. i didn 't like Josh he was a tw * t , i preferred Harvey but then he disappeared. and they got rid of Libby ! it would have been awesome if thy had been bickering in theses seven years. and Mr. craft as well , if him and Zelda got married that would have been gold ! then Sabrina moves out of her aunts house and into Roxie / Miles / Morgan 's house. i didn 't like theses people either , it didn 't really seem they liked Sabrina . Sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff and the aunts seem to be shunned out of her life and into they 're own stupid story lines. i kind of stopped watching it for a while and the old re-runs were back and i was like whoo-hoo ! LOL. i must say the last few seasons were absolutely terrible.they got rid of the aunts which sucked cause they were a big part of the show. then suddenly she lets those two freeloaders move in to the nice house when they treated he like dirt. and now she 's working at some magazine shop so they 're putting loads celebrity guest stars into the show , if they 're in every episode it kind of ruins it. the programme just really went downhill and lost its luster. i saw the last episode. it had the aunts in it ( Zelda was reduced to a candle ) and she 's about to get married but she runs off with Harvey the end. i would have liked to know what happened after. well thats my review and the only thing i can say is the only thing that stayed it 's appealing self through the seven years was Salem the cat . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Tarzan and His Mate " , " the second of MGM 's Tarzan pictures , picks up a year after the events of " " Tarzan the Ape Man " . " Tarzan and Jane have been living happily in the jungle , and Harry Holt ( one of the expeditioners in the first film ) returns , this time accompanied by the less-than-honorable Martin Arlington , in quest of the ivory from the elephants ' graveyard . Naturally , a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way.The first film romanticized everything--the jungle , adventure , romance itself , wild animals , and even death . The second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences , but a more serious tone underlies the action . The characters dare to ask questions like : What if something happened to Tarzan ? What would Jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself ? While these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation , it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn 't always as much fun as the throw-caution-to-the-wind attitude of the original.One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in Tarzan and Jane 's relationship . Tarzan still speaks very broken English , but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate . Additionally , their love for each other has really blossomed , and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle.Most people consider " " Tarzan and His Mate " " superior to the original " " Tarzan the Ape Man " . " Personally , I liked the first film just a little bit better . The main reason is that the relationship between the Harry Holt & Martin Arlington team isn 't nearly as likable as Holt 's relationship with James Parker ( Jane 's father ) from the original . The Mr. Arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain , but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie . The movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him . ( Also , I don 't want to give anything away , but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him , Jane never finds out about those events , so the ending isn 't quite as satisfying as it could have been . ) All of these detractors are relatively minor , however , and it 's still a great movie.Like the first film , " " Tarzan and His Mate " " has amazing action scenes , wonderful wildlife footage , and one of the screen 's all-time greatest romances . If you liked the first film in the series , this is definitely a sequel to see . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OK , I got the DVD set last week and I am finally getting around to posting my reviews , but I sure liked this sequel in many ways.Zombie Bloodbath 2 : Rage of the Undead . OK . This one movies at a fast clip , has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style . I would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish DV shot flicks that I have bought . Most of the time , I get rather angry at DV movies for being boring and looking like soap operas . Even a movie like Bone Sickness that I like , has incredible stretches of DULL . Not this movie . It never stops long enough to let you catch your breath . Although I wouldn 't say I liked it better than the first film , I will say that Sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films . This one has better gore , the inevitable zombie feeding scenes , scumbag characters , and a few returning actors ( although their roles are different ) mainly Jerry Angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell . The shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell Sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film . Some of it works and some of it doesn 't , but I have to say that at least he wasn 't just trying to do a larger version of the first film . There was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical spillage , just Satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life . So I say kudos to Mr. Sheets for trying to do something different with this one . I give this film two bloody thumbs up ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Bend It Like Beckham " " reminds me of the best of those 80 's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes . Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive , there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings , and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes . Nothing wrong with this , however . " " Bend It Like Beckham " " is an absolute treat from beginning to end . My wife and I found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it , and at the end , as embarrassing as this is to admit , we applauded ( and we saw this , by the way , in our living room , not in a theatre ) .

" LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with ' lol ' says it all . I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid ; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all . The low budget , horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then . I watched it again yesterday and just couldn 't stop laughing . It 's so bad it 's actually good lol . Like another reviewer said , it doesn 't take itself seriously . There 's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so . The soundtrack is so funny , I laugh every time I hear it . The ' climax ' is just a laugh riot . It 's an all out war zone in New York , full of explosions and total chaos ... so ridiculous you can 't help but chuckle at the sight of it . Other hilarious moments : - The scene with Kersey and the cop running side by side like 2 cowboys against the whole Wild West was so cheesy it was funny.-It killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at Kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking ever-so-careful ( and slow ) aim and not get hit LMAO . Of course , with him it was one shot-one kill with his elephant handgun LOL.- Another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gang .... with a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol ... destroying the whole side of the apartment building with it.- It 's apparent that Kersey is all but used to losing loved ones ... when his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates . The acting is so bad that you can 't blame anyone that could only think that Kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lol .... he runs down , looks at the carnage and just walks away.Again , so bad , it 's good . * * * out of * * * * stars . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I saw this movie during a Tolkien-themed Interim class during my sophomore year of college . I was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy- everyone else was laughing , but they weren 't within constant eyesight.Let 's get it out of the way : the Peter Jackson ' Lord of the Rings ' films do owe something to the Bakshi film . In Jackson 's version of The Fellowship of the Ring , for instance , the scene in which the Black Riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in Bakshi 's film , shot by shot . You could call this plagiarism or homage , depending on your agenda . I 'm sure the similarities don 't stop there . I 'm not going to do any research to find out what they are , because that would imply I have some mote of respect for this film . I 'm sure others have outlined the similarities- look around.This movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor , and many , many people died in the accident . I 've decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological fashion- If I 've left out anything else that offended me it 's because I 'm completely overwhelmed , confronted with a wealth of failure ( and , at high points , mediocrity ) . * Due to heavy use of rotoscoping , Gandalf is no longer a gentle , wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom ( whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film ) . * Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as ' Aruman ' during the film , without explanation . He wears purple and red for some mysterious reason . * Sam is flat out hideous . The portrayal of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying . Yes , hobbits are small like children , but they are NOT children . * Merry and Pippin are never introduced--they simply appear during a scene change with a one-sentence explanation . The film is filled with sloppy editing like this . * Frodo , Sam , Pippin and Merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road . One of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back--which was not visible before--and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into " " la-la-la " " s . AWFUL . * Aragorn , apparently , is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic ( no pants ) , complete with huge , square pilgrim belt buckle . He is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie--oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass . * The Black Riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil . They limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace . This is disturbing to be sure , but not frightening . * The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen ( in which they stare at Frodo , who is on the other side on horseback ) goes on forever , during which time the Riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and ... do nothing else . The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo 's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound . It turns out to be more plodding than anything else . * Gimli the Dwarf is just as tall as Legolas the Elf . He 's a DWARF . There is simply no excuse for that . He also looks like a bastardized David the Gnome . It 's a crude but accurate description . * Boromir appears to have pilfered Elmer Fudd 's golden Viking armor from that Bugs Bunny opera episode . He looks ridiculous . * Despite the similarity to Tolkien 's illustration , the Balrog is howl inducing and the least-threatening villain in the entire film . It looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers , and it 's barely taller than Gandalf . " " Purists " " may prefer this Balrog , but I 'll take Jackson 's version any day . * The battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing . Almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments . I 'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson 's film , but they ARE supposed to be fighting . * Treebeard makes a very short appearance , and I was sorry he bothered to show up at all . Watch the film , you 'll see what I mean.Alright , now for the GOOD parts of the film . * Some of the voice acting is pretty good . It isn 't that Aragorn SOUNDS bad , he just looks kind of like the Jolly Green Giant . * Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal ; like Tom Bombadil , she seems immune to the Ring 's powers of temptation , and her voice actress isn 't horrible either . * Boromir 's death isn 't as heart wrenching as in Jackson 's portrayal of the same scene , but it 's still appropriately dramatic ( and more true to his death in the book , though I don 't believe Jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did ) . * As my professor pointed out ( between whispered threats ) , the orcs ( mainly at Helm 's Deep , if I 'm correct ) resemble the war-ravaged corpses of soldiers , a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what 's being attempted . * While this isn 't really a positive point about the film , Bakshi can 't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie , or so I 've been told--the project was on a tight budget , and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher-ups ( who I 'm sure hadn 't read the books ) .Let me be clear : I respect Bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude . I simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product . Overall , I cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien 's classic trilogy even for laughs , unless you 've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters , places and events . I 'm sure somebody , somewhere , will pick a copy of this up in confusion ; if you do , keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is quite an amazing film to watch . Using digital technology , the director , Rohmer , has literally encrusted his living actors into painted backdrops . Most of the time this works brilliantly , especially at the start where the film is like a pop up story book come to life . It is less successful in a few scenes , where it limits camera angles ( they had not painted the side of some of the buildings for example ) but it is a very interesting way to film a historical film which is as much about our own misconceptions and limited views of history as History itself . It is narrated using the memoirs of the Duc d 'Orleans ' ex- mistress , Grace Elliott . So , an event usually claimed as one of their own by Marxist historians , especially in France , is here told from the point of view of a female aristocratic foreigner . Inevitably a different point of view emerges -there can be no objective representation . The use of the memoirs device does give the film a rather episodic quality . Personally , I found the story line around the King 's death the most interesting . A staunch Royalist she is shocked when the Duc votes for the King 's death ( a basic knowledge of the French Revolution is probably helpful to follow the dialogue between Grace and the Duc here . He was Louis 's cousin and had himself elected to the Assembly , where he promptly changed his name to Philip Equality ) . The filming of Louis 's death is masterly . Grace and her maidservant are in Meudon , out of Paris , watching from a hill with a telescope . We do not see the execution , we only hear the maid 's commentary , like Grace . The most dramatic event of the Revolution happens off screen . Grace cannot bear to watch her king be killed . Her view is that of an aristocrat . Any justification of Louis 's death is literally beyond her vision . This is powerful , keenly intelligent film making . The love story between the duc and Grace is insinuated , never told , and is powerfully moving ( tho the Duc does seem a bit of a pompous fool at times ; what does she see in him ? No accounting for taste ) . The undercurrents of madness ( simply existing being enough to be a suspect ) that sweep individuals along in a time such as the Revolution are illustrated as Grace 's life is turned upside down , her house is searched daily , yet she still orders her servants to cook her food and is incapable of dressing herself ! If you have any interest at all in a subtle , well told film , making clever use of new technology to tell an old tale , or the representation of a pivotal moment in Europe 's history narrated by an aristocratic foreign woman , its ultimate outsider , then this is well worth your time . It is a little slow in places but your patience is amply rewarded . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Imagine that you could have anything you wanted , go anywhere you wished , be anything you 'd ever dreamed of being - through thought alone . Now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life . What would you do ? Would such powers be worth your soul ? This is the dilemma presented to Captain Christopher Pike in " " The Cage " " the now-legendary pilot episode of the original Star Trek series . Famously deemed " " too cerebral " " and " " too cold " " by NBC brass and rejected , " " The Cage " " was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time , and Gene Roddenberry did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste , with the result being this truly classic Star Trek episode , which embeds " " The Cage " " into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale , a landmark in TV history and one of the first truly serious sci-fi stories ever filmed for the small screen ... Star Date 3012 : The USS Enterprise diverts to Starbase 11 after Mr. Spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the Enterprise . Surprisingly , the message cannot be from Captain Pike after all , as he is now confined to a wheelchair , mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident . Kirk and Starbase commanding officer Commodore Mendez attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery , but before the matter can be cleared up , Spock - for reasons as yet unknown - commits an act of open mutiny , kidnapping the helpless Captain Pike and hijacking the Enterprise via a brilliantly thought-out and timed plan aided by a few Vulcan nerve pinches . Soon , the Enterprise is headed for the remote , forbidden planet of Talos IV . Mendez informs Kirk that Talos IV is under interdiction , and any contact with the planet by Starfleet vessels or personnel carries an immediate death sentence , meaning that Spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself , and Kirk as well , given that the Captain will be held responsible for the ship 's activities . Appalled , Kirk and Mendez give chase in a shuttlecraft , which itself becomes dangerous when the Enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and oxygen are nearly gone . Spock - knowing that Kirk must be the one following the ship - is of course unable to consign the Captain to certain death . After ordering the craft to be retrieved and the occupants beamed aboard , Spock reveals what he has done to McCoy and demands to be arrested , after having set the starship on an irreversible course to Talos IV . Upon reassuming command , Kirk demands an explanation , whereupon Spock requests immediate court martial by a tribunal of Starfleet commanding officers - of whom there are three on board - Mendez , Kirk , and the crippled invalid Captain Pike . Spock 's encyclopedic knowledge of Starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence . Spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the Federation and the inhabitants of Talos IV - a journey taken 13 years earlier by the Enterprise itself under Pike 's command . Kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail , but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by Pike himself , who turns out to have been lured to Talos IV by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a Federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously . Among the survivors is Vina , a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster . Pike is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot , whereupon he is waylaid and captured by the Talosians , a race of androgynous humanoids with enormous cranial capacity and the power to transform thoughts into virtual reality . After Pike 's capture , the rest of the " " survivors " " vanish as none of them really existed except Vina . The episode ends when the tribunal learns that Spock 's " " evidence " " is in fact being transmitted to the Enterprise directly from Talos IV , in violation of Starfleet regulations . Starfleet orders an immediate halt to the transmissions , and we wonder what will happen next ... To be continued in a review of " " The Menagerie : Part II " " ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ahh , Talespin ! What can I say that hasn 't already been said about this great show ? Nothing ! This is without a doubt one of the most well-written shows I 've ever encountered , live-action or animation . The newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes , and some of the " " mature " " stuff I have to shoo kids out of the room for . But not Talespin.The stories are engaging and very plausible . Some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie . Episodes like Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike . Then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the Bluest of the Baloo Bloods and Stuck on you , where the emphasis is on hilarity . I can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones.The drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays ( at least , those which aren 't specifically geared toward it ) , especially in cartoons . In the episode Stormy Weather for instance , Kit Cloudkicker decides that he 's going to join an air circus , but Baloo believes that it would be too dangerous . In the biggest fight of the episode , Baloo yells at Kit to stay away from Daring Dan , to which Kit screams " " NO ! You can 't tell me what to do ! YOUR 'RE * NOT * * MY * * DAD * ! " " and buries his face in his pillow . The next day he leaves for the air circus . This kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon , and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays.The Characters have a lot of depth to them . Baloo is pretty much the way he is in The Jungle Book , plus or minus a few degrees of laziness . Rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money , while good in theory , are seldom good in practice . Molly is a cute little girl , but you can 't let that deceive you . She can be a real hellion sometimes . Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest . He doesn 't trust adults much unless they appeal to him , and he has a tendency to break off relationships . Watch his expression in Plunder and Lightning when he grabs the grappling hook : he looks as though he 's prepared to put it right through a pirate.In the end , it 's the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show # 1 in my book . The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real , almost father and son . This is demonstrated well in All 's Whale That Ends Whale when Baloo takes Kit 's word for it that Seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults . Baloo and Becky 's relationship is also realistic , due to Baloo 's motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol ' Sea Duck , not necessarily a desire to help Rebecca . But something tells me that if he did get the Duck back he 'd still do jobs for Rebecca.The Sea Duck , not to mention all the other planes in the series , is pretty realistically designed . The plane 's functions don 't change once throughout the series ( continuity like that is hard to come by also ) , and unlike most other " " super-planes " " of other cartoons , it doesn 't have one single weapon on board ( unless you count mangoes ! ) , and relies instead on it 's cunning pilot 's great skill to get out of trouble . It 's hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn 't have some sort of gun turret , laser cannon , or even a handgun somewhere on board . And the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays . Plus it 's just such a darn cool design ! This is definitely the best cartoon . Ever . Period . Definitely worth all ten stars ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Now that I have seen it , it was NOT what I was expecting , at least not until the very END . I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from Amazon and was glad I did . Having been first introduced to Park 's work via Oldboy , I was curious to how he 'd treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it . I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because while Oldboy and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work , he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other vamp movies . For example the scene where Father Hyeon is realizing the " " beast " " growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot Tae-ju and he is able to SEE the blood pumping through Tae-ju 's skin and his eye 's widen in blood-lust for it . That was a nice effect . I was also happy that Park did not CG the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little CG at all . I came away from Bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true Park fashion . Additionally , I liked that Park played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we don 't usually get this is Asia cinema . During the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring . Park treats you a little like Ghost of Christmas future coming to show you , albeit a bit boringly , what life is like outside your world . Ah , but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen Father and his burgeoning lust for Tae-ju and conflict with duty as a priest . We almost start to root for them even until Park not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end Bakjwi is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong . It won 't spoil it if I tell you to watch Bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and I think you 'll come away from it with what Park wants you to come away with . Don 't expect Oldboy and stylization because that 's not what you 'll get here . A very interesting take on the genre indeed . Those who missed the MANY literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie , not Bakjwi . After Bakjwi , watch Let The Right One IN , it 's also not what you 'll expect either . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Possible Spoilers As Peter Jackson has so brilliantly shown in his ' Lord of the Rings ' trilogy , it is quite possible to make good films , even great ones , within the heroic fantasy genre . The genre has distinguished literary antecedents , dating back to the mediaeval chivalric romances , particularly the Arthurian legends , upon which Tolkien and other authors have drawn . ' Lord of the Rings ' apart , however , it is difficult to think of any other sword-and-sorcery films which are any good . I would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad bunch was Ron Howard 's ' Willow ' , and even that achieved little distinction other than that of being a merely mediocre film as opposed to a positively bad one . ' Red Sonja ' , however , cannot achieve the even more modest distinction of being simply a bad film as opposed to an appalling one.As with ' Willow ' , many of the plot-elements in ' Red Sonja ' are derived from ' The Lord of the Rings ' . An evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artefact with supernatural powers in order to achieve an ambition of world domination , but is thwarted by an assorted group of heroes . The film , set in the Hyborian Age , a barbaric era in the earth 's remote past , starts with the villain of the piece , the wicked Queen Gedren , making unwelcome sexual advances to the heroine Sonja . When these are rebuffed , Gedren ( not a woman to take no for an answer ) reacts by murdering Sonja 's parents and brother . ( In 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the chief villain a woman but also to make one of the main motives for her villainy frustrated lesbian lust ) .Gedren 's next move is to capture the Talisman , a sort of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers , by slaughtering the whole of the scantily-dressed female priesthood charged with protecting it , just as they are about to destroy it because they feel its powers have become too dangerous . Among the dead is Sonja 's sister , her sole surviving relative . Sonja herself , however , has not been idle , but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduates summa cum laude , and sets out to avenge herself . Along the way she teams up with Kalidor , a heroic wandering swordsman-king resembling Tolkien 's Aragorn , Prince Tarn , the spoilt child-ruler of a kingdom that has fallen to Gedren 's powers , and Falkon , Tarn 's loyal servant . The rest of the film is fairly predictable , as Sonja and her allies try to overthrow Gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out-of-control Talisman.Just what is it that makes this film so bad ? Well , the acting , for a start . Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kalidor gives the sort of typical wooden , poker-faced performance that became his trademark , at least in the early part of his career , complete with heavy foreign accent . Compared with Brigitte Nielsen as the heroine , however , he looks like Laurence Olivier . Miss Nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties , delivering every line in the mechanical , toneless voice of someone who has just completed lesson three of a ' teach-yourself-English-by-correspondence ' course . One wonders if she was hired for the role just to make Arnie look good by comparison . The other characters , while not conducting their own private struggles against the English language , are simply cartoonish caricatures , especially Prince Tarn who must be one of the most obnoxious screen youngsters ever.An even worse fault than the bad acting , however , is the film 's almost complete lack of imagination . This is a particularly glaring fault in a fantasy film , as films of this genre need to rely on their imaginative power in order to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be provoked by a fantastic plot . When we watch Peter Jackson 's masterpiece we can persuade ourselves , at least for the next three hours , that we are in Middle-Earth , that elves , wizards and hobbits do exist , and that the fate of the world really does depend upon the destruction of a magic ring . When we watch ' Red Sonja ' we are persuaded of nothing except that we are watching a bunch of actors with bad accents fighting one another on a hillside for possession of a lime-green football.This lack of imagination even starts with the film 's title . The British science-fiction author Brian Aldiss , when challenged about the exotic names given to his characters , replied that there was little point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were going to spoil the effect by calling the hero Joe . ( Admittedly , Tolkien was ableto get away with giving the name Sam to one of his main characters , but that was because Hobbits were supposed to be reassuringly familiar , the Middle-Earth equivalent of tweedy , pipe-smoking Englishmen ) . Similarly , giving the heroine of a tale ostensibly set in a long-gone barbaric age a common girls ' name like ' Sonia ' ( which is how the name ' Sonja ' is pronounced ) is about as appropriate as calling her ' Betty ' or ' Mary-Jane ' .The film seems to have been made on a very small budget , which makes me wonder why they bothered at all . Fantasy needs to be done convincingly , or not at all . It was obviously shot in a remote mountain area , with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture . The few buildings we see , such as the temple of the Talisman or Gedren 's palace , are obviously cheap sets . We learn that Tarn 's capital city has been destroyed by Gedren using the power of the Talisman , but we do not actually see this event ; all we see is what might be a thunderstorm taking place on the other side of a hill . At first you wonder how Sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies , but when you see how small an army Gedren has at her disposal it becomes more understandable . When an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace , you wonder if this is the Talisman at work or merely a crew member inadvertently leaning against the set . If we can enjoy this film for nothing else , we can at least enjoy it for its inadvertent humour ; a fine example of the so-bad-it 's-funny school of filmmaking . Ed Wood would have been proud of this one . If it had been shown on Californian television the night before the recall election , Gray Davis would still be governor . 2 / 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Alain Chabat is a fine actor , writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an ' idea ' credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when Aristophanes was still learning that it 's ' i ' before ' e ' except after ' c ' . But , like I said , Chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to . I 'm also gradually overcoming an aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg who also turns in an accomplished performance . If you absolutely insist on knowing , the ' plot ' is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single . This doesn 't sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an ' arrangement ' with the sister of a colleague to pose - for fifteen thousand euros -as his new girlfriend , allow the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him , thus getting him off the hook .

" Welcome to Oakland , where the dead come out to play and even the boys in DA hood can 't stop them . This low-budget , direct-to-video production seems timed to coincide with the release of Land of the Dead , the latest installment of George A. Romero 's famed zombie series . The ghetto setting and hip-hop soundtrack may provide additional appeal for inner- city gore hounds . Ricky ( Carl Washington ) works at a medical research facility while raising his kid brother , Jermaine ( Brandon Daniels ) . But the teenager , bored by macaroni-and-cheese dinners in their tract house , would rather spend his time hanging with street friends Marco and Kev . Apparently there is not a lot for African-American high-school dropouts to do on this side of the bay except deal drugs and scuffle with the homeys , including rival Latino gang bangers . Ricky plans to sell their late parents ' house and move inland to the Castro Valley , a more middle-class and presumably safer environment . Unfortunately , before this can happen , a drive-by shooting leaves Jermaine dead on the porch . Grief-stricken Ricky tries a last desperate ploy . He tells Scotty , his lab assistant , to steal some of the experimental cell regeneration formula they have been testing on rats . When a double dose fails to revive Jermaine , there is no choice except to call 911 . But a funny thing happens on the way to the morgue . The boy is reanimated as a sputtering , growling zombie , chews the ambulance drivers and staggers off into the night , bent on revenge and hungry for fresh meat . The feeding frenzy infects more victims , and before the night is over the East Bay is a battleground between the living and the blood-spattered undead . The horror genre has seen more than its share of cheap movie makers , from Ed Wood to Herschel Gordon Lewis to Charles Band . But low budgets do not necessarily mean bad films . Consider Val Lewton 's programmers ( Cat People , The Leopard Man , Isle of the Dead ) , Roger Corman 's Poe quickies , Romero 's Night of the Living Dead and John Carpenter 's Halloween . The difference between memorable and awful has more to do with talent and ambition than money . Hood Of The Living Dead is more fun than several hundred million dollars ' worth of recent high-priced horrors . Cheapness has its charms . In truly cheap films actors wear their own clothes amid real settings . Here the tract houses have freshly painted walls in neutral matte tones , lending a bleakness as oppressive as Douglas Sirk 's bourgeois melodramas of the ' 50s . Lines seem more improvised than scripted . " " So what the hell are we gonna do now ? " " " " Just keep your eyes open for any F N ' thing that looks out of the ordinary . " " Ricky and Scotty call their boss , who calls an ex-military man named Romero . " " I have a huge bitch of a problem that we have to take care of fast . " " " " Not a problem , " " says the merc , closing his phone and grabbing his guns . Everybody has guns , and even when fighting zombies they 're on their cell phones , as who isn 't nowadays ? Information is exchanged with naturalistic understatement . " " What happened ? " " " " We got into it with some crazy motherfockers . " " " " Deja F N ' vu . It 's that park zombie again . ... " " Ricky even has to blow his twitching girlfriend away , saying only , " " She 's gotten out of hand . " " Unlike most zombie movies , this one provides a motive for mayhem . Jermaine takes revenge on the gang bangers who shot him , who in turn continue the rumble . This is urban film-making that implies its own social commentary , a near-guerrilla production suggesting a future for low-budget horror that reflects real life instead of supernatural clich챕s . The brothers Quiroz , who have trademarked their name as if in anticipation of a new movement , may inspire others to tell stories arising from personal experience rather than imitating tired Hollywood product . Considering their limited resources , Jose and Eduardo Quiroz have made a cheap but technically acceptable feature about people they know . Photographer Rocky Robinson gets the job done , music by Eduardo Quiroz is no simpler than Carpenter 's haunting Halloween theme , and hip-hop songs by The Darkroom Familia and others add atmosphere . The result is promising if not exactly exhilarating . They are learning their craft and , unlike Lewis and Wood , who never got any better , their next may be one to watch . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" After recently seeing , Cry Uncle , by the same director , I decided to seek this out and am I glad I did ! ? This is an extraordinarily good film .

" This movie is one I strongly recommend . It 's about a boy , Stanley Yelnats ( Shia LeBeouf ) who is wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake , a boys ' detention center . There , he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diamiter . While there , he meets the other boys of the camp ( Zero , Magnet , Armpit , Squid , x-Ray , and ZigZag ) . All of them are digging , not to ' build charactor ' , but to find outlaw Kate Barlow 's treasure . Throughout the movie ( and book ) Stanley learns more about the past , more about himself , and more about digging holes . I give this movie a 9.5 , because , I am very picky when it comes to books to movies , ( I want the movie to follow the book EXACTLY ) . But , still it did real well . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon , and in the process of trying to escape , he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised . Soldiers are able to retrieve the case , but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out . They eventually make it to where he 's hiding , and " " cleanse " " the hotel and its occupants . Unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation , and if you 've seen Return of the Living Dead , you know what happens next.Zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike , as a complete mess of a movie . While that 's a fair assessment , it 's not without it 's high points . For one thing , it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore-hounds happy . There 's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible . They 're in the water , the rafters of houses , hiding in trees , and for some reason , they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush , only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape . There 's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator . You have to see it to believe it , as that scene alone makes Zombi 3 required viewing IMO . It may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting , especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors I 've seen , but Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie . Sometimes it 's nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesn 't require anything more than your time and an open mind . Zombi 3 fits that bill , and then some . It 's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers , and watch it with some like minded friends . I give it an 8 / 10 , just because of sheer enjoyment . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of the things that makes this Ealing comedy so outrageously funny is the clever editing . Shots that would be considered absolutely essential to most modern comedies are deliberately left out . ( This is what was known as British understatement . ) Three instances : A comic fight is edited like this . Alec Guiness has invented a new cloth that will ruin the industry . Half a dozen businessmen invite him to their office to try to get him to sign a contract relinquishing his control of the cloth so that production can be suppressed . When he catches on to this , Guiness stands up and turns to walk to the door . Two men block his way . " " Excuse me , " " he says quietly , taking a step forward . The two men move between Guiness and the camera . Cut . A secretary is sitting outside at her desk . There is silence until the buzzer begins signaling her frantically . She takes up her notebook and opens the door to the inner office where a full-fledged noisy Donnybrook is in progress and the room is half wrecked . Guiness dashes out the open door.The following example would be unthinkable today . During the research phase of his invention Guiness sets up an elaborate chemical apparatus but instead of converting the experimental liquid into the new cloth , the device explodes . Again and again it explodes . The laboratory is cleared of all other work . The blasts continue . Ceilings fall down . Windows are blown out . The director of research is seated at his desk in a tiny office cluttered with debris , a bandage on his head . When the door behind him opens he jumps a foot in the air . " " Sit down , " " he tells his visitor , " " there 's another one due at any moment . " " It is excruciatingly amusing -- and there is not a single shot of any explosions . This would be unimaginable now without a fireball , and maybe a building collapsing in slow motion.Last example , consisting of a series of quick , relentless cuts , put together precisely . Guiness is being pursued and is cornered in the lobby of an office building by people who want him to sign the contract . Faced with two men about to grapple with him , Guiness backs up with a determined expression . He bumps against a pedestal with an iron bust on it . The bust topples backward and bumps against the wall . There is a shot lasting about one second of the bust hitting the wall . Another brief shot of a metal shield hung above the bust being jarred loose and falling down . Quick cut to Guiness 's head rising into the frame . Cut to the two men staring into the camera while horrible brass banging and thudding sounds are heard off screen . Cut to Guiness flat on his back . Nobody today would have the cojones to NOT show Guiness being crowned by that shield.I won 't go on with this . It 's a comedy alright but a pretty bitter one underneath all the hilarity . In solving one set of problems , Guiness has created dozens of others . He is opposed both by management and labor , neither of which is shown to much advantage . And of course the economic implications have to do with more than cloth . " " What about that car that runs on water with a pinch of something or other in it ? " " one of the workers asks . " " Vested interests , " " comments another worker , as Thorstein Veblen nods in his grave . What WOULD happen if our problems with energy were solved overnight ? If I owned shares of Exxon -- and I think I do -- I 'd shudder at the thought . Where would the oil industry be if there were no more need for oil ? For that matter , where would the police force and the FBI be if crime were to suddenly disappear ? This is a thoughtful and very amusing movie , superbly directed and edited . The roster of performers is peerless . Joanne Greenwood with that husky voice . The blithering Cecil Parker . The wheezing mummified Ernest Thesiger . A first-rate job all around . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Porgy & Bess " " was the very first movie my parents ever took me to see . Even at the tender age of 5 years , I was so greatly moved by the drama that I cried aloud at the screen " " Crown , PLEASE don 't take Bess ! " " I was fortunate enough to see the one TV broadcast of " " Porgy & Bess " " so many years ago and now all I have are the great memories ( and the record album ) to remember this wonderful , wonderful movie . I have been waiting and wishing and hoping that one day I might own a copy of " " Porgy & Bess " " - but it doesn 't look like it will happen . What is the hold up ? Obviously , there is enough public interest in this movie to warrant a release . After all these years , I remember it and it sure seems like I 'm not alone .

" If you like Star Wars / Trek , come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices . It 's my top 2 favorite movies of all times , other-worldly-futuristic and psycho-thriller . The intensity of the root material ( Shakespeare 's " " The Tempest " " ) is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry ( a la later Lucas ) . And just because it was made in 1956 , don 't assume you can ' see the strings ' holding the flying saucer up . This was the first movie where you COULDN 'T . Miracle it was made at " " A-movie " " scale , economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it . And director Wilcox 's previous ' hit ' was " " Lassie Come Home " . " Until I looked him up , I assumed ' Fred Wilcox ' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous , but at the time didn 't want to be associated with sci-fi , which was strictly a " " B " " genre back then . This was either a very VERY visionary production , or a very fortuitous ' mistake ' on the part of the folks who bankroll Hollywood.There are the massive-scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that Lucas used extensively . There are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical ' user interface ' ; " " computers " , " as they 've come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works . Star Trek 's ' transporter ' is there , visually , almost unaltered by Roddenberry 10 years later . And if the Trek / Wars technobabble turns you off , FP 's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate , even today . The " " ship " " set is comprehensive , sparklingly realistic , as good as anything you 've seen since , and more convincing than anything ' Trek ' has done , for TV or film . We didn 't get to spend as much time there as I would have liked.If you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently , watching FP will explain all that . It 's definitely not ' Wagontrain to the Stars ' . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This documentary was very thorough and exposing , and at the same time entertaining , which I thought was rather impressive . I felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its ' origin until present day , but nonetheless , there is a reason why I do not give such a high score to this film ... I felt as if at times the story focused too much on the ' proper nouns ' of the sport , so to speak : too much on individual locations at which to surf , and especially too much on individual surfers . I felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport , the ideology of the sport , etc. it would have been better ( although this of course was covered , I do not think it got as much time as it warranted ) . And for many people who are not absolutely nuts about surfing , at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring . Although the video clips and the in-depth research is well-respected , it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers.Furthermore , my biggest disappointment was at times they spoke of how utterly amazing and miraculous certain events in surfing history were yet they did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding , and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing , breath-taking event that these men are talking about as life-changing moments , and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking about it , and not the actual footage . It was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories , and then be unable to see them . I understand the difficulty of obtaining footage of everything , but please : do not brag an event up so much , and then not show it . Overall , a very fresh documentary that I enjoyed watching ; not the best documentary due to the above reasons , but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack , it is a documentary that I would advise everybody to check out . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This little film had long been on my " " keeper " " list . Do people realize how stressed out , menopausal , emotionally abused women ( as well as the mentally retarded ) were REALLY treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century ? ? ! ! All of the pious uptight Christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls , let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity . Can you really imagine ( by today 's standards ) that Walt Whitman 's books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a mans ? Think about that ! The sensitivity of this movie still gets me and I give credit to the director for capturing this through his eyes . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But for the rest of us , the movie has many hilarious , and for that matter quotable , sequences , and the plot isn 't half as dumb as that of " " Black Sheep .

" This very good movie crackles with tension . The stakes are , of course , high--will the police and Widmark , the public health doctor , apprehend the criminals who don 't know that they are carrying plague before a full-scale epidemic breaks out ? But smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene--between Widmark and the police captain , between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel , between Palance and a dying plague-stricken man whom Palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity , between Widmark and his wife , and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full-scale panic . The movie is beautifully shot by Kazan , in extraordinarily well-choreographed long takes shot on location in New Orleans , and ends in a stunning climax , where Palance flees like a rat from his pursuers , through the docks and warehouses of the city . The commentary is superb , probably the best that I 've heard , covering the cinematography , the framing and lighting of shots , the production design , the casting of non-professional actors in small roles , and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot , like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally .

" It 's wonderful to see that Shane Meadows is already exerting international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS : the vague class identity above working but well below middle , the unhinged father , the abandoned urban milieu , the sense of adult failure , the barely concealed fascism underpinning modern urban life . But if Meadows is an expert formalist , Mariage trades in images , and his coolly composed , exquisitely Surreal , monochrome frames , serve to distance the grimy and rather bleak subject matter , which , Meadows-like , veers from high farce to tragedy within seconds . There are longueurs and cliches , but Poelvoorde is compellingly mad , an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions , whose attempts to realise them are hatstand dangerous ; while individual set-pieces - the popcorn / pidgeon explosions ; the best marriage sequence since THE DEAD AND THE DEADLY - manage to snatch epiphany from despair . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The film Classe tous risques directed by Claude Sautet was not a film , to be honest , I had ever really heard of until the Film Forum in NYC said that they would have a 2-week screening of the film , with new English subtitles . When I also read that it was in the vein of the classic French crime films ala Jean Pierre Melville , I jumped at the chance to check it out ( at best it would rank up with his great works , and at worst I would get some good popcorn in a great theater ) . It was well worth the admission , as Classe tous risques is one of those kinds of French films that is just waiting to be re-discovered ( or discovered for the first time ) . With terrific , tense diligence , Sautet keeps the suspense at a tight pitch for the first forty minutes of the film , keeping a good ( if not great ) middle section , and then ending it up with what is always expected with these films , but with fascinating motivations by way of the characters . With a film in the vein of this sort , you know how it will end , but it 's the cool , observant journey that counts.The film features a performance with some real truth and honesty , amid the " " old-school " " criminal 's code , by Lino Ventura as Aldo , who at the start of the film ( one of the best beginnings to a film in this genre and country ) steals a hefty amount of money with his partner in crime ) . When there is a sudden , ugly twist of fate on a beach late one night , Aldo is again on the run with two little kids . He gets the aid of Eric Stark ( Jean-Paul Belmondo , a role in tune with Le Doulos only with a smidgen more humanity and charisma ) , who is also a thief and drives him into Paris . But there are some problems with some of Aldo 's old business partner 's , and one old score may be just the right ticket . A couple of times the plot may seem to be leisurely , but it isn 't . Like Melville , Sautet doesn 't allow any fat to his story , and it 's a very tightly structured film , with some good doses of humor here and there ( I was sometimes grinning at the audacity of the criminals in the beginning chase sequence , and also with a particular woman who had a finicky thing with her cat and a fish ) .Along with a fine score by the great George Delerue , exceptional cinematography , and a mood that is seldom met let alone matched now adays , Classe tous risques is a reminder of that bridge between the real old-school film-noir , and the latter day crime films . Gangsters in these new sort of " " thug-life " " movies have a 1000th of the class and honor of the thieves in this film , and is a second banana to the works of Melville and Jules Dassin ( a compliment I assure you ) . That it has a good realistic , moral edge helps as well . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is more Lupin then most , especially coming from Funimation . Other then the bad dub , it isn 't bad.The first hour is a lot like the Comic ( which is what all Lupin the 3rd stuff is based on ) . Lupin 's trying to get a huge treasure . Fujiko 's using Lupin 's weakness to women to try to get something out of it . The last bit isn 't that bad , he 's with another women , but of course Fujiko 's still him number one.A lot of the other Lupin movies are more Family with cuss words then Lupin . Any good Lupin fan I think will be pleasantly surprised ( I know I was after hearing so many bad things about this movie ) . It might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits ( they make it a little mushy ) but overall , it isn 't a bad film .

" OK .... so , by minute 15 in the film , there 's still no dialogue.This film arrived to me in a padded sack from Down Under , with Sharpie encrypted info on the front . I am a programmer from a North American fest , and MOD LOVE was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preem 'd at the far-away Moscow / Karlovy Vary interface.Straight away I thought " " this film is not for us " " ( no dialogue by minute 15 ? ? ) but kept watching anyway . Well , well , well . It built and built and built , and half way in I was involved in this film , because , like when you go to the zoo , at first you 're reticent , but by the time you get to the dangerous snakes bit , you 're totally ' there ' .This film has a dangerousness , not at all like the much hyped WolF Creek , but because it is so totally ' other ' in every way shape and form , and seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of most independent first-time helmers ie . - gloomy weather , red-neck intrigue , odd splicing , eerie music , and a plot which , though imperfect and basic , has a bit in common with one of the ' great Aussie Movies ' ie The Cars That Ate Paris , by Wier . But MODERN LOVE is actually not really a very Aussie movie in the sense of Ocker-ishness and playful self-deprecation that pervades many of that country 's films . It works on a more nightmarish realm from the start . No cell-phones , no brand names , no i-pods , no gritty urban middle / class angst - just a dude married to a good-looker , an old Volvo , and a little boy ( son ) who has weird teeth and chucks stuff around . Oh and it 's set in weird sea-side village where people all look slightly ' wrong . ' Photographed by Nick Matthews ( 2 : 37 ) and music by Tom Huzenroeder ( Ten Canoes ) MOD LUV succeeds where many Aust. movies fail - ie it stands up without regard to the " " god-forsaken " " country that it comes out of . Instead , it revels in a warped but entertaining riddle which the film itself cannot solve - and herein lies the weak link ... what on earth does this film have to do with " " Modern Love " " ? ? ? ? The final minutes of the film seem to give an answer , or at least hints at one .... and as I sat and drank a coffee and ate my Hershey 's afterwards , all that I could surmise was that this film 's helmer , Alex Frayne , will prob have a lot of fun with this one . / , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I believe ABC has done a disservice to the writers , actors and to the potential audience of this show , to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following . There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful . This show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters . In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would love this show if they even knew about it . Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away . I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them .

" The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother 's love , the exceptional performances , the steady execution and the quite innovative script . The film tells the story of an Indian woman , Nandini , who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja . All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India ( of whom she had not even known ) is in troubles and the couple rush to India . When they get into the village , Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture ; Shekhar 's family , ruled by his cruel , highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha , lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless . Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home , but he is soon killed by his father 's enemies . When she wants to leave , Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India . Here starts the intense struggle which can be called " " Nandini vs. Narasimha " . " India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film , but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas , so it may be even correct . The portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent . Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world . The locations are amazing , the music is wonderful , and Krishna Vamshi 's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing . One thing that must be noted is the very ear-pleasing background score by Ismail Darbar , it is beautiful . The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film . Portrayed realistically throughout , the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch . Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written , and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points , a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.The film 's biggest strength is the performances . Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini . Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible . She displays so much intensity , impulsiveness , anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son . Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child . After Fiza , this is her most powerful performance . One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen , Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha . He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him . Patekar displays cruelty , wittiness and even humanity with total conviction . He is outstanding . Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from India 's most underrated actress , Deepti Naval , who sensitises her character to perfection . Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief . Anyway , do watch Shakti - it could have been better , but it is definitely a must-watch . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" True fans of film will love this authentic movie.I disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one-star and calling it unrealistic . While I don 't have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists , I 've spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave . I don 't know what the basis is for others ' comments that the film is " " unrealistic " . " The dialog is great.The low budget production value didn 't bother me a bit . I felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film . The focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy Hollywood propping or melodrama.I completely bought into the character 's motivations and reactions . The acting was believable and impressive for new and non-actors.If your idea of good film is Transformers or Fast & Furious , then skip it . If you enjoy good character driven dramas , then see it .

" Probably the best film of the year for me . This small French film centers on put upon office secretary Carla ( Emmanuelle Devos ) who spends her days doing other men 's jobs , uncredited , and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as , being partially deaf , she reads lips . A change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con Paul ( Vincent Cassel ) as her assistant . The relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film . Mutual dependency , for vastly different reasons , bonds them . Carla becomes attracted to Paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for , what seems like , the first time . Paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help . He owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve Carlas ' skill of reading lips . I think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense / drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars . Throughout the whole film , no matter what other characters are on screen , you can feel this amazing bond between Carla and Paul . I cannot remember when I have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors . Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance ( she won the French Cesar for best actress ) . You never feel like you are watching a piece of acting , this really is Carla . The chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful . He makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive . I loved this film because of these two people , and both times when I had finished watching it I wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ah , true memories . I lived in Holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every Sunday evening and later Tuesdays . I saw it during my 14-16s . Very good for my ( at the time school- ) English , as Dutch TV provides subtitles for other languages , except for kiddies shows nowadays . So you would hear the original voices and language . - The best series were the first three ones and then after the third series , the great character , Nazi Von Gelb , who was such a formidable enemy , disappeared from the series ( I don 't think they ever really caught him , he always escaped , leaving room to have him appear again in a next story ) because evidently the series also was distributed to Germany , and a Nazi enemy wouldn 't go over very well ! Too bad , because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent Nazi aristocrat , who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on England . It was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series , but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal . They were very believable to me at the time and as a kid I could just imagine to be part of these youngsters , who at the time were about four years older than me . It was a very exciting series to me , standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with " " the Prisoner " " as well . I hope they will publish a good quality DVD of the series , that would be wonderful . Even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch . The later series were not as good , watered down and just not as much fun as the first three . Hopefully they also find the other series with Von Gelb to be put on DVD .

" The episode begins with scenes of a dead woman bather washed up on the shore , a forlorn Jim strolling along the beach lost in reverie and a night ride home that ends in murder and mystery . Yep , this is an atmospheric little number with a super twist at the end . Jim does well to unravel what is , a priori , an inexplicable case of a woman going missing 20 seconds after she enters her home . To be sure , the eventual explanation is a little far-fetched . Why , for example , go to the lengths of substituting a woman midway thru a car journey when simply rubbing her AND her companions out would 've been as easy and left less of a trail . However , these niggles aside , it 's a memorable TRF episode full of invention , even if YET AGAIN Jim gets put in the frame by an ever suspicious Police Dept . I mean to say , have the ungrateful so-and-so 's ever sat down and counted just how many of THEIR files have been solved by dear ol ' Jimbo ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The animation is still the slightly rougher style of the first episode , Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire , but already , with this first regular episode , Bart the Genius , the humor is beginning to be more " " layered " , " quicker and greater depth of characterization is already appearing.This episode firmly establishes Bart 's " " slacker " " personality , and more subtly , Lisa 's intellectual superiority to the whole family . Although that 's the main theme of the whole episode ( there 's also a nice secondary theme of Bart and Homer 's father / son relationship ) , it 's given to us first in a nutshell as the episode opens with the Simpsons playing Scrabble . Lisa comes up with " " id " " for her word--short , but something you have to be well educated to know . She has to read the definition to the rest of the family from the dictionary , which has been serving as a way to prop up the couch . Marge can only come up with " " he " . " Homer has " " oxidize " " already sitting on his tray in order , but doesn 't recognize that it 's a word , so he presents " " do " " instead . Bart comes up with " " kwyjibo " , " which he insists is a word . Similarly , in the main plot line of the episode , Bart cheats on his IQ test , which leads to his being put into a special school full of gifted kids . We know that 's not likely to last long . " " The Simpsons " " has always had a lot of fun playing with varying degrees of intellectual abilities among people through its characters , and more importantly , they way that people with vary degrees of intellectual abilities fit into ( or not ) , are accepted ( or not ) and are perceived in society . Aside from beginning to present Bart , Lisa , Homer and Marge 's place in this context , this episode already starts respectfully poking fun at nerds and geeks outside of the Simpsons family . Via some of the dialogue from the students at the special school , as well as some of the other references , including purely visual ones , this episode also shows that " " The Simpsons " " isn 't going to pull any punches by means of writing or talking down to its audience . It may be just a cartoon , but it 's a cartoon that intellectuals , geeks and nerds are going to understand more than anyone else . And that fact , aside from it just being a very funny show , is the key to the show 's longevity . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place . The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable ( fantastic acting on both parts ) ! I loved how Diane lane 's daughter acted in the show too . She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life . I loved this show from start to end .

" Clever psychosexual drama about a wounded Union soldier ( Clint Eastwood ) who seeks refuge in an isolated Confederate school for young women during the Civil War . Slowly , Eastwood begins to seduce every girl in sight , until the tables are turned and he becomes the pursued in an unsettling , gothic-toned finale . Never has a film been so deliciously erotic yet disturbingly macabre at the same time.This is undoubtedly Eastwood 's finest hour ( those who tune in for " " Dirty Harry " " will indeed be surprised ) , while the rest of the cast gives uniformly superb performances .

" An opera diva has an accident , which leaves the door open for her understudy to take over the role . Betty ( Marsillach ) is now the star of Mac Beth , but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own planned out . He gets his kicks out of tying Betty up , putting needles under her eyes ( so she cant close them ) and murdering members of the opera company before her very eyes . " " Opera " " is certainly one of Argento 's more ambitious films , like mixing it up with Shakesphere 's Macbeth there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is Giuseppe Verdi 's version of Macbeth but also Argento , just like Shakespeare uses ravens as an omen of death and misfortune . And like the ravens circling the castle Dunsinane , foreboding the demise of the scheming Macbeth , the ravens in OPERA play a key part in the downfall of the killer . Furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the exhortation of his lover . But I don 't want to go as far as saying OPERA is intended to be a remake of the either The Phantom of the Opera or Macbeth , the similarities are far too subtle . It 's just a typical Argento masterstroke , and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid hue of Gothic mystique.Although this movie does have it downsides like the heavl metal soundtrack just doesn 't fit in with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange.All in all " " Opera " " is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The actors were great they sent me the feeling that i was living the story at the same time as the movie was playing ... The landscapes were so beautiful were the film was shot ... and it did charmed me .. Also the music was extraordinary and i have nothingto reproach ..

" I remember this film as the other person that commented said . I recorded over it but wish I had it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever . Funny , in a real bad way . I remember the tag line on the box was " " The ultimate frontal lobotomy " . " I got it from my mom , who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst / cheesiest movie she had ever seen , so my mom said " " My son will probably love it . " " and the woman gave it to her just to get it out of her possession . I then later taped over it , which I regret . I also remember the " " corck screw " " thing was one of those ball catcher things .... the yellow cone shaped things , with a red " " button " " at the end , and when you hit the red thing , it sends a ball flying . Well , they used that with a crank on one end , and a corkscrew in the funnel . When the killer killed they would show him coming forward with the " " weapon " " and then cut to a close up of what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victims head .

" The problem with the film is quite simply this , Conrad 's prose is powerfully verbose and cannot be adapted to a movie . Marlow 's narration in the novella captivates you from the first sentence and you only " " see " " what Conrad writes about . In movie , it 's different , you see the visual , but the description and reflection that really makes the novel , is frightfully missing . But as far as an unadaptable book has been adapted , it is of good standard . There are the exact same scenes , which are pinpointed quite geniously , but they never have the same affect as in the novel . The plot in the movie has been enhanced , and it works very well to make it more interesting . The references to Ancient Egypt were thoughtfully inserted .

" From the excellent acting of an extremely impressive cast , to the intelligently written ( and very quotable ) script , from the lavish cinematography to the beautiful music score by Carter Burwell , Rob Roy offers a rarity in movie going experiences : one that is nigh impossible to find fault with in any area.There have been several comparisons made with Braveheart , which came out the same year . With all due credit to Mel Gibson , Braveheart struck me as too much of a self-conscious and preachy epic to rival Rob Roy as the kind of movie I would care to see more than once . While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic , Rob Roy just grabs you and absorbs you into its tightly edited storytelling . Not a single scene is wasted.Rob Roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension , action and even occasional humor . The characters are well fleshed-out , perfectly conveying vernacular and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic period setting.Further , they are not caricatures of good and evil as we all too often observe in even modern film.For example , while we hope the heroic Rob Roy prevails , we realize his predicaments are products of his own pride and sense of honor . Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of cinema , yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is . Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping.Rob Roy is a delightful treasure , featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure , the image of the cranes that are crossing a Muscovite sky . They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish , in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment.In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness , and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration . It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams.But Man is not a bird . Life draws up its own rules , from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort . War breaks out , and without much hesitation Boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty . He cannot even say good-bye to Veronica , for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away . Surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract Boris ' attention must inevitably fail.Boris eventually gets killed in war , without Veronica learning about it for the moment . His brother Mark , a vigorous musician , who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption , is eager to take his place . Veronica initially resists , but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms . A marriage takes place , which is never accepted by the family.Soon feelings of guilt seize hold of Veronica and she realizes that Boris ' return is the one and only thing she actually longs for . She therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the self-sacrificing work in a field hospital.When war finally is over , once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers . Again Veronica is among them , forcing her way through a wall of bodies . In her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers , until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers , for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris ' death.Once again the cranes invade the sky , drawing their wayward lines . But now Veronica is watching them on her own , and the look in her eyes is a different one . She has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans , to follow the guidelines of your dreams .

" General Trelayne is a super-being who wants to play a little game with the crew of the Enterprise . A lot of extremely unlikely and nonsensical stuff seems to be happening , and Trelayne seems obsessed with the human practices of warfare and murder . He seems to need to experience what he imagines to be a thrill and has created a human environment ( though a few hundred years out of date ) in which to play out his fantasies . The environment is subtly inauthentic , and the crew immediately begins to spot the inconsistencies . Pretty soon it becomes clear that Trelayne is not just an immature god , but a very fallible one . Regardless of how you feel about this one , stick around for the Twilight Zone-like ending . It is well worth it.As many have pointed out , Trelayne 's character inspired the more developed and amusing on-going character Q - and you can see in John DeLancie 's construction of that personality more than just shades of Campbell 's Trelayne . It is fun to compare how the four captains we have seen coping with Q all deal with him so radically differently . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Having seen only once and in the dawn hours , I can 't seem to forget this haunting film . A mix of mystery , suspense , and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of Vertigo.The actors , though not that well known are good especially Joan Hackett in one of her best performances.You believe in her , in her love , in her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love , and in the end in her overwhelming pain.The plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility . The direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect . And it has one message : don 't let revenge blind you , you can became its last victim.A real pity it has not been remade , but perhaps it is a period piece better left alone . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie from what I remember was such a great movie ! I watched it on television when I was 11 , and couldn 't remember the title of it . If I remember correctly , I do believe that it was a Christmas television movie special . One of my friends at work and I were discussing it several years back , but neither one of us could remember the title . But we did remember almost the entire movie . No one else at work remembered ever seeing it ! Thank goodness someone at a TV movie website answered my post ! Now I have the fun job of locating a copy of it ! It 's amazing what you can remember as a child , but this movie definitely remains vividly playing in my head ... even after 28 years . And I do believe I only watched it once . Maybe it was because I am the oldest sister in my family , or maybe because I babysat and worked in day care centers , that it stuck with me that long . Regardless of the real reason , it has remained one of the movies that I have been really wanting to watch lately ! ! ! If anyone knows where to watch it online , or has a copy , please let me know .

" I 've seen this movie on several different occasions . I find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it.Type 1 : OLD PEOPLE . A lot of old Japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest-to-goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval Japanese dialogue . As soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences , the old people walk out , usually disgusted.Type 2 : FILM SNOBS . These people think that just because a movie bears the label of " " Independent " " that it will automatically be a load of hard-to-follow , overemotional crap that may or may not be in English . Yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured . They are really in for a surprise when they see this film . As soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime-inspired sword battles or the over-the-top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation , these people will be so dismayed , they will walk out . A few will stay just to see " " how bad it will get " " and later they 'll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends.Type 3 : PEOPLE EXPECTING TO SEE LIVE-ACTION ANIME OR MATRIX-LIKE SPECIAL EFFECTS . Sorry folks , the martial arts are pretty solid in the film , but director Yamasato really doesn 't have the budget for that kind of thing.Type 4 : PEOPLE WITH NO EXPECTATIONS . These are the people who really enjoy the film . Whether they had only heard of Blood of the Samurai , picked it at random , or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze , these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is : ENTERTAINMENT . This movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought , it was meant ( if I may borrow a line of dialogue from the film ) to " " really kick some ass . " " And that 's what it does.So depending on what type of person you are , you may or may not enjoy this film ; however , if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting , then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I just watch this move recently on Encore channel . What a great film , a great cast as well . Flatliners is very suspenseful and unpredictable . The movie has a great opening scene by the ocean then to a series of scene establishing the questions about life after death which provide a very strong upfront story involvement . Therefore Nelson played by Kiefer Sutherland was the first to go through the test to die and come back to life . Then it 's gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong doing from the past to life . Then all of the above mentioned characters went through the same experience except for Randy steckle played by Olliver platt . Then the story unfold into a resolution and basic understanding about life and the presence and meaning of God . David Labraccio played by Kevin Bacon an atheist end up questioning his own belief about God .

" Two Soldiers is an excellent example of fine film-making . The director and producer took a heart-warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast , excellent cinematography , and very creative artistry.The relaxed back-woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details , and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into . The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears , as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back-woods of North Carolina and an even harder life of war.The acting was great , particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen ( played by Jonathan Furr ) , to the older brother ( played by Ben Allison ) and the powerful perfomrance by the Colonel ( played by Ron Perlman ) . The performance was extremely well cast.It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers , and I heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

So who ever thought this movie was lame ... I have deep pity for because they can 't suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult or they never went as kids . The whole point was that these people had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile again and so they did at every opportunity . I wish I could . It was funny , intelligent , beautifully scripted , brilliantly cast and the artistry takes me back so I want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even .

" A lot of people are flaming this film for the presence of Paris Hilton , but this is not a fair reason to object to the movie . The reality is that Paris has a fairly minimal part , she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen . The film also makes fun of her on several occasions , usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision . For those who enjoy Paris Hiltons stage presence , this may be a movie to see at home when its released on video , because at the screening I was at , we all laughed at her misfortunes through the movie and she is portrayed as a " " woman of questionable values " . " The movie itself was pretty good ( unlike the recent flood of weak horror flicks ) , it has everything a good horror should ; a creepy villain , excessive violence , acts which make that average person cringe ... this movie hit all the bases .

" Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic " " Alive " , " there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director Ren챕 Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film " " Supervivientes de los Andes " . " The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13 , 1972 . This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers , most of them members of a professional rugby team . But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers . Of course you can 't claim that this cheaply made and roughly edited film is better than the famous 90 's version but I definitely appreciate and respect this film more . After all , an exploitation film demands a lot more input from both cast and crew while the big-budgeted Marshall film , although intense , feels more like routine money-making . The sets and special effects naturally can 't compete with " " Alive " , " but " " Supervivientes ... " " delivers an equally impressive sentiment of hopelessness and creates an even more nightmarish hell of snow . Cardona 's film is ambitious , surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most remarkable Mexican productions ever . I am really astonished that Cardona 's take on this story isn 't more exploitative and explicit . The scenes where the deceased passengers are cut open and consumed are nevertheless hard to digest , but they only serve to increase the credibility of the catastrophe and to stress the inhuman conditions of the survivors . Rather praiseworthy for a vicious director who gained fame with his notoriously bad films like " " Night of the Bloody Apes " " and the Santo-series . The unknown young Mexican actors do a great job and the musical score is endearing . The story is well-known , of course , so the screenplay doesn 't offer any unexpected shocks . Either by history or previously having seen " " Alive " , " you know which kind of dramas these people still have to endure before being rescued and you can only await them . Still , this is a good film that shouldn 't be bashed like too often is the case . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I may differ from many people on this board but I enjoy watching Mind Of Mencia . The reason I like Mind Of Mencia is the host is not afraid to speak his mind or exploit stereotypes . Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends but are unwilling to admit and then some.Mencia has no problem doing jokes about any race , religion , sex , or orientation . While he gets a lot of flack for this it is a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times . Mencia does not care if he offends anyone but he is not a racist and even does jokes about his own race.The typical format for the Mind of Mencia goes like this : there will be an open skit making fun of a person or recent event . Mencia then comes out and does a 5 or 6 minute stand up where he talks about various issues . The show then has 2 separate skits divided by commercials . In these skits Mencia does a variety of things such as making fun of people , giving his personal opinions with a funny twist , or simply doing parodies of people , events , or movies . At the end of the show Mencia comes out for a minute with either one final skit or something else to say.People criticize Mencia for exploiting stereotypes and say his statements are overly offensive . Carlos only does what everyone else thinks of certain races but are afraid to say . As for Mencia being offensive he is only speaking his mind . I find nothing wrong with that.The show is not perfect . The skits can be not put together the best and sometimes Mencia does go over the line in his jokes . For the most part however it is a show where the comedian says what is on his mind no matter what the consequences and presents in in a humorous matter . So if you aren 't afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone speak his mind and often say what you have wanted to say then watch Mind Of Mencia . However if you are easily offended you should not watch this show because you will be offended or worse yet you might even laugh . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" ' Mad Dog ' Earle is back , along with his sad-sack moll Marie , and that fickle clubfoot Velma . So are Babe and Red , Doc and Big Mac , and even the scenery-chewing mutt Pard . The only thing missing is a good reason for remaking Raoul Walsh 's High Sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame , and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original . ( Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler , for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance , for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters , and so on down through the credits . ) The only change is that , this time , instead of black-and-white , it 's in Warnercolor ; sadly , there are those who would count this an improvement.I Died A Thousand Times may be unnecessary 혯 and inferior 혯 but at least it 's not a travesty ; the story still works on its own stagy terms . Earle ( Palance ) , fresh out of the pen near Chicago , drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin Lon Chaney , Jr . 혯 knocking over a post mountain resort . En route , he almost collides with a family of Oakies , when he 's smitten with their granddaughter ; the smiting holds even when he discovers she 's lame . Arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up , he finds amateurish hotheads at one another 's throats as well as Winters , who throws herself at him ( as does the pooch ) . Biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel , Palance ( to Winter 's chagrin ) offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl 's deformity , a gesture that backfires . Then , the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath . On the lam , Palance moves higher into the cold Sierras .... It 's an absorbing enough story , competently executed , that lacks the distinctiveness Walsh and his cast brought to it in 1941 , the year Bogie , with this role and that of Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon , became a star . And one last , heretical note : Those mountains do look gorgeous in color . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" At first I was weirded out that a TV show 's main character could bring the dead back to life , but then I thought I 'd give it a shot . Guess what ? I love " " Pushing Daisies " " and look forward to Wednesday nights just to watch it , then for the next week I watch it a few more times on my DVR . The colorful characters , witty banter , fast-paced dialogue , and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end . Ned and Chuck Charles ' relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they cannot have physical contact . Even Detective Emerson Cod 's character has continued to grow in complexity . And Olive Snook ! Jiminy Crispies ! She cracks me up ! The narrator 's voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that I am watching a movie instead of a TV show . I have recommended my family and friends to turn on " " Pushing Daisies " " and they are hooked too ! ! ! The show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen " " P.D.

" Loved the movie . Loved the two families crossing paths in history . Only question is if Sam gets killed then how does his family 's line continue ?

Never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher ? Maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing Kate Bandit ? Even with the mistakes in the movie . Just loved it . The acting was great . Not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir being Marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier .

" I just re-watched a few episodes of this series on very poor VHS tapes that I recorded the series on . I 'm glad I did , though.Ramona is based on the children 's books by Beverly Cleary and follows the adventures of the title eight-year-old ( Sarah Polley ) . She has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble much like many eight-year-olds . All ten episodes are pretty good . " " Mystery Meal " " kind of grosses me out as a vegan , but it 's funny seeing the parents trying to get their kids to eat cow 's tongue ! And any episode that mentions Godzilla Versus The Smog Monster twice can 't be all bad . I like " " Ramona 's Bad Day " " even more . Although it 's disheartening to see Ramona going through a rough day , she does imagine herself getting revenge on her friend Howie 's uncle ( a pre-Psi Factor Barclay Hope ) , who always teases her . " " The Perfect Day " " is also good.Lori Chodos plays Beezus , Ramona 's sister . I swear I 've seen her on something else , but IMDb doesn 't list anything besides this show . Unfortunately , this series is not on DVD . Why is every crappy show made these days on DVD except something I 'd actually like to buy ? An injustice if there ever was one ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr Skateboarding Team , and their influence on skateboarding . It also focuses on the history of skateboarding . It was directed by Stacy Peralta , a member of the original Zephyr Team , and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk , another member of the team . The documentary stars the members of the Zephyr Team and is narrated by Sean Penn.The documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding , and how it evolved from surfing . It discusses skateboarding 's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s , its decline in the 80s and its ' rebirth ' in the 90s . Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown , the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica , California . The Zephyr Team originated from the Zephyr Surf Shop , which manufactured the first modern skateboards . The documentary mainly consists of the original Zephyr Team members talking about the past in the Zephyr Team , the competitions they won , and their popularity and prestige . It focuses on three particular members of the team ; Peralta , Tony Alva , and Jay Adams , three virtuosos of skateboarding , and probably the best three members of the team.The interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from Dogtown in the late 60s and 70s . Very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed , but when you do , they are shown in black and white , while the archival footage was in colour . I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past ( i.e. the Glory Days of the Zephyr Team ) and not the present . The documentary is very fast paced , in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era ( such as Jimi Hendrix , Led Zeppelin and David Bowie ) , and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point . Knowing nothing about skateboarding ( i.e. not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground ) I was very surprised that I found this documentary so interesting . The reason is that this doco was more about the Zephyr Team than the actual sport of skateboarding , so while I couldn 't relate to skateboarding , I could relate to the boys in the team . Because it was made by actual members of the team , it gives it a little more depth and authenticity.All in all , I would have to say this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen . It gave me a whole new insight , not just into the Zephyr Team , but into skateboarding as a whole . For those who love skateboarding , I can only imagine how it must be even more interesting . Seven and a half stars out of ten . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" SOLDIER is not as bad as many have made it out to be . I found the film to have some of the sacarstic , cynical humour like that in Paul Verhoven 's Starship Troopers . The lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic-book atmosphere.One particular trivia-bit stands out for me - Todd has the names of several space-war campaigns tattoo 'd onto his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE . For the oblivious ones out there , Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy Batty 's elegiac last lines in Blade Runner . To imagine that Todd could have fought alongside android troops like Roy is mind boggling to say the least . Maybe script writer David Peoples was nostalgic ? I 'll give this one 3 out of 5 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is an extremely long movie , which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting , but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies.If you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart-wrenching , because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak . If you can love a monster you 'll cry for Magnus Pym , the spy who betrays everyone - notably his country , his friends and family - a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same people.There isn 't one truly likeable character in the entire story , not one loyal , ' moral ' personality to sympathise with . But watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable.I really enjoyed it in the end . Well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ah , Moonwalker , I 'm a huge Michael Jackson fan , I grew up with his music , Thriller was actually the first music video I ever saw apparently . Believe it or not there was a time where Michael Jackson was like a God to people , a time where women fainted at the sight of him before really fainting before seeing the sight of him , sorry , Michael . But Moonwalker was what started to be a tribute to all of Michael 's success of the time right when he released his famous Bad album that was record breaking , was the first album to have 6 top ten singles . Michael is an incredible artist , there is no doubt , he writes , sings , dances , but when it comes to acting or keeping a story straight with his audience혚 not so much.We start off pretty simple : Jackson 's music , life , career , success and the mania that was the 80 's biggest star in the world Michael Jackson . Later on , Jackson is a 30 's style gangster who uses his powers as a crime figure to protect the children . When Jackson was allowed to be near children , we cut to him playing in a field with the children and their dog . The dog runs away , and in their search for it , Jackson and the children uncover the lair of Mr. Big , Frankie Lideo , a drug dealing mobster with an army of henchmen who wants to get the entire populace of planet earth addicted to drugs , starting with the children . Mr. Big discovers Jackson and the children , but they escape ; Jackson tells the children to meet him at Club 30 's , which turns out to be a haunted nightclub abandoned since the 1930s . The story goes back to the mobsters attack on Jackson , and here it is revealed that Jackson is actually a magical gangster , who draws his power from shooting stars . As one passes by the club , Jackson transforms into a sports car and mows down several of Mr. Big 's henchmen . The story picks up on the children at Club 30 's , and at first the children are afraid , but when Jackson appears the scary atmosphere of the club transforms and the children find themselves back in the 1930s . The club is now filled with zoot suiters and swing dancers . Jackson participates in a dance-off with the other club members , which serves as the music video for " " Smooth Criminal " . " At the climax of the song , Mr. Big lays siege to the club and kidnaps one of the children , Katie . Jackson follows them back to Big 's lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen . Mr. Big appears and mentally tortures Jackson by threatening to inject Katie with highly addictive narcotics . While Katie manages to just grab Joe Pesci 's glasses and get free from being injected , Mr. Big decides he 's had enough and orders his men to kill Katie before finishing off Jackson , but not before a shooting star flies by . Jackson transforms into a giant robot and kills all of Mr. Big 's soldiers . Yup , ummm , you want more weirdness ? Watch the movie.Moonwalker is fun for the first half hour , seeing Michael 's success and all his hard work really makes his fans appreciate him once again . Is it mostly to hype up his album ? Yeah , I love how he spends the first 25 minutes praising how awesome he is , then we go to his song called " " Leave Me Alone " , " which is kind of hypocritical , not that it 's not a great song , just a small turn of events . Then when we skip the crummy acting , the story was incredibly weak : The villain spells his name out loud while Michael and Katie are spying on him , lol , Michael is a transformer all of a sudden , the villain 's big monster plan is to make kids high ? Also the villain has some sort of massive ray gun that would make Marvin the Martian blush . But if there is one new thing that is incredible that the movie gives us is the new video for Smooth Criminal . This music video is perfection , it 's choreographing , it 's setting , it 's song , it 's smooth style , Michael always goes above and beyond perfection and Smooth Criminal was incredible . I loved Moonwalker as a kid , I still watch it for fun to this day , but it 's not the best movie by any means , it 's pretty silly , but it 's all good if you 're a Michael Jackson fan as well.7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren 't exactly true to character , this was Classic H : LOTS . The characters , outside of Mike Giardello ( Giancarlo Esposito ) , were true to form , and the reunion scenes of Pembleton ( Andre Braugher ) and Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen . " " Homicide : The Movie " " aka " " Life Everlasting " " is a fan flick , but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series . Fontana , Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of " " the best damn show on television " " together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give it . True to " " Homicide " " form , there were no happy endings , such is life . That 's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie-cutter cop shows left on television .

" You can 't watch a film like Peter Watkins ' " " Privilege , " " a story of the exploitation of a pop music performer by big business , the state , and even organized religion , without thinking of creatively degenerate commodities like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears , who hawk corporate giants like Pepsi or some other poison for money . Or any number of entertainers , in music or movies , who become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests like Scientology and Kabbalah . A film like Privilege must have seemed almost like science fiction when released in 1967 , so fantastic was its premise . Today we tend to take celebrity endorsements for granted , giving little thought to its more alarming implications . Watkins ' vision has not only become reality , we tacitly accept this reality as " " normal . " " Now consider Punishment Park . As Privilege challenges the viewer to examine what is being sold to us , and why , Punishment Park demands that we reckon with what is being taken from us , and why . Heaven help America , and for that matter the world , if contemporary politicians get their hands on this film . It is already so close to reality , that in viewing it recently , I experienced a genuine , nauseating feeling of anxiety.Watkins again skillfully employs a documentary-style narrative . Whereas in Privilege some rough edges to this technique were apparent , in Punishment Park it has been honed to sharp , seamless perfection . The sense of realism is enhanced by disarmingly unpretentious , economical , believable portrayals by the entire cast . This is the kind of acting Hollywood has completely turned its back on , to its detriment , in favor of cosmetically perfect image projections . The cast has first-rate material to work with in Watkins ' screenplay . Many cinematic visionaries have tried to shake the viewer out of their complacent , false sense of security . No one has ever achieved this result with such stark and chilling accuracy as Peter Watkins does here . " " What seems quite clear now , is that instead of trying to bring the estranged and excluded Americans , such as these people , back into the national community , the Administration has chosen to accept and exploit the present division within the country , and to side with what it considers is the majority . Instead of the politics of reconciliation , it has chosen the politics of polarization . " " To paraphrase one of the characters , we don 't have to call them pigs because they know what they are .

" OSS 117 was fun from start to finish.It 's difficult to define why one film touches or connects with you or not , and I won 't try to analyze such perfect comedy , so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it : ) ! Everything is old fashioned here , from women 's clothes ( sigh ! ) , Mambo dance , the " " hero singing " ... " ( " " Bambino " " sounds like an Italian canzonetta sung in ... arabic : ) ! ) .Hubert is physically imposing , but dumb as hell . From all the 007s , he looks like Sean Connery , but is definitely more sympa because he 's ... silly , speaks his mind all the time , giggles , even has some homoerotic fantasies and there are rumours about him . In short , as an anti hero , he rocks : ) ! Sometimes he only raises his eyebrows or frowns , and that 's all it takes to make you laugh . B챕r챕nice Bejo is the true queen of the film . Graceful , treacherous but with ideals . Aure Atika , to the contrary , is reduced to a femme fatale of sorts . It 's surprising to see her that " " sexy bomb " , " thou.You just can 't compare it with " " Austin Powers " " ! I agree with Amazon 's D. Hartley ( Seattle , WA ) on it being respectful to the genre.Which is your favourite scene ? One of my favourite scenes is the " " fight of the chickens " " with the masked villain .

" The End of Suburbia , as it should appeal to general citizens & mass consumers alike , is likely to become of cultural reform status . The film uses super-cynical analysis by authors , policy makers , and social philosophers on the paradox created by Suburban-Style living--mainly in the Post-War era.What we have created in America is a place with " " none of the amenities of country life , and none of the amenities of urban city life . " " This is the prescription that is laid out for suburbia , and the film focus 's on the singular idea of " " Oil " . " Basically , in the most general sense , that the world is nearing or at it 's peak oil production , and when we realize this in full , major lifestyle changes will be in effect , whether by our best interest or forced violently upon us by a quality of living even the slum-dwellers of Calcutta couldn 't describe to us.If nothing more , the end of Suburbia will siphon the viewer flush in their gut , creating a sickening feeling . This is bound to happen . It 's a bleak outlook on our inherent way of life . The ambivalence lies particularly in each respective viewers critical analysis of the film . I foresee many unprepared viewers slandering the film as smug liberal propaganda--like a Michale Moore film . What they fail to consider is that a reaction like this is all too normal when such a message hits so unbelievably hard to the lifestyle of the vast majority of the masses.This is the truth , and as a student studying City Planning , I can tell you that we better get prepared now , because what slim chance we have of maintaining quality of life in this dwindling cesspool of tampered resources is fading faster than a race of people stricken by the black plague . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is a very , very odd film ... one that is so odd it 's best you just see it for yourself . The film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is ! You can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic--finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance . Additionally , he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life.Later in the film , he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head . Oddly , this is only half-way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life . This is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professor 's novels--one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say them.See this weird film--it 's amazingly compelling and not like anything I 've ever seen before . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

They happen upon the farm of a " " Sesech " " woman whose husband has chosen to go off to the Confederacy . The portrayal of Eastern Kentucky , and its seriously divided sentiments during the War , is so very accurate . If you are looking for a war film with a lot of blood and guts , this would not be it . If you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of peoples at war , actually and philosophically , then this is the best study of how divided loyalties affected the interaction of peoples in the border states during America 's Civil War . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Director Jay Craven 's adaptation of Howard Frank Mosher 's ' Where the rivers flow north ' is one of the finer transitions from literature to the screen . Craven is an admirer of Mosher 's work -- he also directed ' A stranger in the Kingdom ' .The cast is superb -- especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal . Torn offers what could be the finest role of his career -- Noel Lord , the fiercely independent former lumberjack who is at the center of this story . Tantoo Cardinal 's portrayal of Lord 's live-in housekeeper / common-law wife is dead-on as well . I 'm both amazed and disappointed that neither of them were nominated for Oscars when this film was released . Performances of this calibre should be acknowledged . The only character that 's a little hard to swallow for me is the power company executive played by Michael J. Fox . He just looks too much like a kid in this role . I guess there 's a curse attached to youthful looks , no matter how much people want them.Craven has done a nice job here in bringing the character of early 20th century Vermont to the screen -- locations , angles , sets , all combine to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story . Cinematographer Paul Ryan was exceptional . The score by the Horseflies is also first rate -- it fits the mood and scenery perfectly.And the story itself ... ? One of the most compelling portrayals of the fiercely independent American pioneer spirit ever -- a trait that is on the wane in this day and age . When it appears in modern times , the person is often looked upon with suspicion and disdain . In Noel Lord , we have a character whom we can admire for his values , and even for his stubbornness.This is not a stodgy ' period piece ' , but a vibrant look at an era that is gone , and a type of character that has all but vanished . These are not gold-plated heroes , but real people , with both strengths and weaknesses at play within them. struggling in a harsh environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world in which they live . Like today , there are those who wield power that would have it otherwise . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie brings to mind " " Boys ' n the Hood , " " " " Menace to Society , " " " " South Central " " and others of its ilk and even shares actors with some of them . The film 's " " us vs. the law " " mentality is underscored by the all-black neighborhood vs. the nearly all-white police force . Here the cops are so bad they seem like caricatures and in one scene they even ambush the boys as they drive by in a car they 've just " " liberated " " from its owner . It 's like a bushwhacking from an old Western , but the contemporary setting makes it look all too real.The story centers on young Jason Petty and his buddies , to whom school is just an inconvenience that takes time away from their " " real occupation " " of boosting cars . This happens to be Newark , N.J. , a rust-belt city low on jobs but notoriously high on crime . In fact the problem is so severe that the cops all have " " Car Theft " " written on their backs , to show that an entire unit must be devoted to this particular crime.The boys use a " " slim Jim " " to gleefully break into cars and go joy-riding , as if it 's no big deal . They only run into real trouble when the police ambush them . The vicious , Nazi-like Lt. has a vendetta against the boys , seeing them not as human beings who might be worthy of redemption , but as human targets . In fact , he 's a little reminiscent of that sadistic Nazi officer of the Warsaw ghetto , who shot down Jews for pleasure in the film " " Schindler 's List . " " When the boys steal a police car in retribution for the ambush , things predictably go downhill fast . They are severely beaten by the cops and Jason finally ends up in prison . Clearly these are " " bad boys , " " who 'd steal your car in a minute , but the film wants us to see them as anti-heroes , showing Jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of his own grandmother . The film left us wondering whose side to take and who to feel sadder for : the boys whose lives are going down the drain , the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shootout at any moment or the city of Newark itself , the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal , soul-dead cops.In spite of the over-the-top portrayal of the latter , the film offers a realistic-looking rendering of the ghetto , of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car theft in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths - law enforcement and crime . Strangely , the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned.The filmmakers ( including producer Spike Lee ) are obviously biased against the Newark police , who , we hope , are not as bad they are portrayed here . Nevertheless , they 've given us yet another a strong , affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and Sharron Corley is fine as Jason . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There are a limited number of fans for movies in the world that would love a particular genre to go to the depths that this crew has done to bring to life something that the very writer of the original film had , up to this point , never achieved . This is a wonderful exploration of the real dedication and love it takes to reach towards a potentially very successful cult film.Originally , with the blessings from Alex Cox , this crew began producing the sequel of one of his movies in absolute true punk fashion . Their goal simply being to fully capture the atmosphere as it should be for a complete tribute to the original " " Repo Man " " film.This is a great tale of dedication and the treachery that can occur along the path to wonderful movie making . A truly entertaining tale and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released . The dialog was unnatural . Especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father . I guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog , but what was said seemed false and artificial . The suspense just wasn 't there . The music was about as bad as it gets . The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen . Fortunately the movie was on TV and so I didn 't waste any money renting this sorry excuse for a film ! I honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than was presented here . It 's too bad that the time of an entire film crew was wasted on such trash ! I guess the only positive thing I can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ossessione , adapted loosely ( or if it is as loose or close to the version I saw of James M. Cain 's The Postman Always Rings Twice with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange I can 't be certain ) by first time director Luchino Visconti , is no less outstanding with usage of mis-en-scene , music ( both diegetic and non-diegetic ) , and the acting . I didn 't know what to expect Visconti to do in his approach to the material , after seeing La Terra Trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit . But this is a totally character and emotional based drama , bordering on melodrama ( however , without the conventions that bog down lesser ones ) , and with the style in the finest path of the budding film-noir movement , Visconti creates a debut that 's as involving as any other neo-realist film . Neo-realism , by the way , could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather ( along with De Sica 's The Children Are Watching Us ) , which that would take shape after the war . Although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo-realist efforts , it 's dealt with in a bare-bones storytelling fashion , and it 's laced with other familiar themes in neo-realism ( the lower-class , death , desperation ) .Aside from the story , which is simply as it is described on this site , the artistry with which Visconti captures the images , and then layers them with objects ( a shawl over Gino Costa 's profile when in guilt ) , shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film ( usually over Gian and Giovanna ) , and the feel of the Italian streets in many of the exterior scenes . Domenico Scala and Aldo Tonti ( who would lens some of Rossellini and Fellini 's films ) help in envisioning the look of Ossessione , which is usually moving in on a character , then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces , their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly , sad and dark and romantic . I think I 've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along , even as I was in fear of the futures of the two leads . The two leads ( Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai ) portray all the compelling , truthful , and near-operatic emotions , and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes . It 's a brilliant , crushing adaptation , and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for Visconti in his career . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

An unusual film for an audience outside the USA . Lena Horne looks fabulous and so does Ralph Cooper . There is not added background of tap steps as in other musicals so you do not hear the beat of the taps which is great realism . Music is muted to hear what dancing steps there are . Acting is a little stilted and the casts speak slowly so that you think the movie is older than it is . Costumes are daring for the time in the dance routines at the end . Often feels like you are part of an audience at a stage show . What furniture you see is very modern which adds to the movies feeling of other worldliness . A must for all film buffs . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Let 's not beat about the bush here , Taylor Hackford 's undoubtedly slick movie has little to make it stand out from the biopic genre other than Jamie Foxx 's exceptional , career-making performance . Remember the year they handed the special effects Oscar to the Terminator 2 boffins , uncontested ? They should do the same with this year 's Best Actor gong.That Ray Charles ' story is worthy of filming is not in dispute . Indeed , the many flashbacks to his traumatic childhood are well-handled and judiciously used . But for a life so unique , the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar . It follows the ' history of a flawed genius ' template almost to the letter : hardship and exploitation , women and drugs , recording wrangles , band squabbles , rehab , yeah yeah yeah . And surely there was more humour in his life than we 're treated to here ? I appreciate Charles ' music yet where neatly-cut medleys would have kept the story rolling , Hackford indulges himself with near-full-length renditions of too many songs - in gin joints , in the recording studio , in concert halls , infinitum . Narratively , and for non-devotees , they begin to act like a cinematic brake . This may seem like harsh judgement on a music biopic but with a catalogue as extensive as Ray 's , we need a taste not the whole dish . Otherwise , we 'd buy the albums.Intrigued as I was , I glanced at my watch more than once . So for all Foxx 's brilliance , maybe Ray would have been better served as an HBO two-parter ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you are one of those people that think Lucio Fulci is all about gore , guts and zombies , you have to watch this ( and " " The Psychic " " too , for that matter ) . Even though the film does include some quite brutal scenes of violence , and a unsettling subject matter , it 's not the main thing here . This is a truly impressive , story and character-driven murder mystery that might well be the director 's masterpiece . Here , he proves that he 's a real craftsman , creating a memorable , disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece , filled with creepy Catholic imagery and interesting social commentary . It also has a great cast , including the gorgeous Barbara Bouchet , as well as Tomas Millan ( from Beatrice Cenci ) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role . Still , it is Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan ( who also stared in Fulci 's bizarre " " Lizard in a woman 's skin " " ) who steals the scene in the role of Majara , giving an excellent performance of a woman driven insane by her superstitions , and her vicious murder scene is particularly heartbreaking . The second star of the movie is Sergio D 'Ofizi 's cinematography who , along with the melancholic Morricone-esquire score by Riz Ortolani , help bringing the " " secluded Italian village with a dark secret " " setting to life . I have to admit thought that the dummy head hitting the rocks kind of pulled me off , but nonetheless , this is a definite Italian horror classic - a moving , sad and ultimately thought provoking work of genius . 10 / 10 for me . If you liked this one , I recommend watching Alfred Sole 's " " Alice , Sweet Alice " , " as they are somewhat similar , and are both underrated gems . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Simon Pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from England to work for a big American magazine . Of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications . Amusing fact based comedy that co stars Kristen Dunst ( looking rather grown up ) , Danny Huston , and Jeff Bridges . It works primarily because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior . We completely understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups . I liked the film . Its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies.7 out of 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Even from the very commencing title of this movie I really love the artwork and canvas layout of one of the national islands of Japan . We see some great rolling green hills and some oriental houses of a coastal town . Instantly we are looking at the Pacific beauty on the widescreen of the theater . And to prove how great this film is , I have to say that Charles Darwin would be proud . Teachers of evolution classes and school sciences such as biology would fantastically favor Hayao Miyazaki 's brand new movie entitled " " Ponyo " . " The title character , as you will see , may be the perfect animation icon of media to be represented in all classrooms and auditoriums alike.Besides the scientific aspect of all this , let 's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story . We have a skinny , old and powerful sorcerer named Fujimoto who lives in a submersible and is cynical of the urban expansion of mankind and their pollution of industrial waste . He wants to have complete control of the seas and the cute looking peaceful aquatic life including fish and organisms . Fujimoto , whose blood is composed to be half-human and half-amphibious , resembles both an ocean loving anti-hero and antagonist ; similar to the James Bond villain Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved Me who operates an Atlantis-dubbed underwater city . His daughter , whom he treats like an over-cared-for pet , is named Ponyo . She is a large goldfish who already looks like a pretty red-haired girl . The father bans her from the real human world , claiming it to be dangerous and too much for her to handle . But quite frankly , Ponyo 's exploratory curiosity is as strong as her amorous nature . Eventually with building strength , similar to wonderful scenes from Nick Park 's " " Chicken Run " , " she breaks free of her father 's rocky and fossilized aquatic city and swims to the water surface of Japan , and to her luck and joy , falls into the caring hands of a youngster ship tanker captain named Sosuke . Living in an ocean front house at a neat looking beach ( or boulder filled beach ) , Sosuke has two overworking parents , a senior home working mother Lisa and the first mate of a tanker barge Koichi . Lisa seems to be angry at her spouse for being away on a ship and leaving her with all the housework . Even more so , the black magic that is exerted by Ponyo causes an apocalyptic chain of events to occur : the moon approaches the Earth too closely and waves surge from the unbalancing of the tidal interaction forces , and humongous tsunami waves rack the peaceful but evacuated town . However what seems to underestimate this curse and seems literally more powerful than supernatural might is the love and tightly embraced friendship between the childish Captain Sosuke and the adorable red-headed Ponyo , who wants to be a sensitive human than just a preserved fish . Much like the frizzly haired and free-spirited hobbits in The Lord of the Rings , Ponyo grants me a slight reminder of that.I could write on and on about this amazing animated film , the best since " " Coraline " " which was in theaters in February . And right now , Hayao Miyazaki , feast your eyes on another 10 star grade from your animation fan , Graham Abraham . The year 2009 may be filled with dozens of animated films ; however , Ponyo is the most towering film of many environmental beauties and should be dedicated as a new wonder of the world . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror strip cartoon , viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia . In that context it is wonderful , but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters . The plotline is also a bit limp for today 's audience , but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well . Jane , you must remember , was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years , created to boost the morale of the troops . She gave a double meaning to the " " strip " " in strip cartoon.The story has something in common with the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard . The theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era , a bunch of bumbling Nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling Englanders , and set in the African jungle of course.For Jane fans , a must see . For the rest of you , a damp squib . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a prime example of uninhibited filmmaking at its best . Richard Greene ( who does good in the role ) search for his two missing friends takes him to the Black Forest domain and castle of one-eyed Count Bruno ( Stephen McNally ) , a past enemy of his whom he has never seen face to face . Incredible film has so many awesome elements combined ( for once ) into a single film--a crocodile pit ; a hulking mute ( played by Lon Chaney , Jr . ) ; a crafty doctor ( played by Boris Karloff ) ; a leopard hunt ( VERY well done and VERY atmospheric ) ; a love story ; a castle ; a swordfight ; a sadistic , one-eyed count and his two evil accomplices ( played by John Hoyt and Michael Pate ! ! ! ) ; an intriguing background story which makes the film even more interesting ; and more ! .

" First animated feature film from Ireland is also one of the best animated films I 've ever seen . Its a real warts and all story that is unlike any of the other Oscar nominees and any other film from this year or any other year.The plot of the film has the Abbot of Kells , a village in Ireland building a wall around his town to prevent the vikings from destroying the town should they ever attack . His nephew Brendon , is a young monk who does the best he can but meets the ire of his uncle by doing things in his own time . When a legendary illuminator Aidan arrives from a destroyed monastery , Brendon drifts towards him and his warm personality . Much to his uncle 's chagrin Aiden offers to teach Brendon how to illuminate . In order to help Aidan work on his great book , saved from his destroyed monastery , Brendan goes out into the forest to get material to make ink . While outside the walls he meets Ashley , a forest spirit with whom he develops a friendship . Unfortunately the Abbot finds out that he went outside the wall and there is hell to pay . But lurking in the distance are the vikings ... Forget what you think you know about this film you 're wrong . Even what I 've explained doesn 't do this film justice . Its a simple story with so much more going on . This is a wonderful movie about trying to find your way in the world , over coming demons and finding the beauty of the world outside of the walls . ( As the film says the world is a dangerous place and doesn 't cease to be even if you build walls ) .Its a film that treats its audience as adults and deals with all of life including the darkness . There is death and destruction and joy and happiness . Its not sugar coated . People die . Monsters lurk . ( it freaked out some of the kids ) , but in the end there is hope . Frankly the darkness in this film is completely unlike anything in any recent American film . Forget the " " sadness " " in a Pixar film , this is the real thing , and its refreshing and it shows how homogenized even Pixar has become.Its a Genndy Tartakovsky-esquire ( Samurai Jack ) animated film who 's look is actually based upon the the Celtic art of the period . Its a film that looks unlike any other . Here again is another film that takes the movie frame and uses it in every way possible. the Images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible . Often the film manipulated things to make it look like a page in the legendary Book of Kells . Its stunningly beautiful and best described as art come to life.Director Tomm Moore has fashioned a film that is a masterpiece . I can 't say more than that . Its a masterpiece .

" When commenting on this film , one must realise that it is based on a true story , and must therefore be reviewed for the quality and accuracy of it 's portrayal of the events , as well as its entertainment value . It may well be implausible that Jack Shepherd should surrender twice to Jack Wild because Wild had captured Edgeworth Bess . None the less , it happened . It must also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced , which explains why he relied upon tried and tested techniques . There were occasions when Clavell did not have the confidence to follow the script as written . The film would be better if he had . And yes , I used to have a copy of the script ( Stanley Baker 's copy - one of five ) , which I returned recently to my father , Rafe Newhouse , the writer . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Without John Rhys-Davies , I have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter . But in spite of that single fact , this is not a bad little thriller , considering the low budget , the low quality effects , the stiff acting and the Sci Fi Channel aspects . The blood effects are very convincing , and the Chupacabra actually looks realistic ... regardless of what you think a Chupacabra looks like this is one good-looking Chupacabra.Aside from the positives , this runs kind of like Kolchak : The Night Stalker ( Darren McGavin , remember ? ) meets the Love Boat , but in spite of the ultimate cheese of this work , it still holds something resembling a plot , and actually attempts to gain your respect while making you laugh and roll your eyes.As conflicted as this work is , I still managed to find some enjoyment herein .

" In today 's world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it . Movies like Psycho and Blair Witch , while being great in suspense ( both with great build ups ) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them . With Mute Witness , a rare treat , I stumbled upon this film and watched it , scared witless , in the middle of the night . I was scared by the menacing Russian ambience , the ' snuff ' theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the ( amusing , which always leads to likeable ) characters could meet the end at any second .

" Ronald Colman plays a prodigal son . While he is NOT a bad guy , he is a bit flighty and hasn 't done a lot with his life other than travel the world and have a jolly good time . Now that his latest venture in Africa has failed , he 's on his way home to England . His rich upper class father plans on tossing him out on his ear , though thanks to Ronald 's winning style , he is reluctantly welcomed back with open arms.At this point , there are two women in his life--showgirl Myrna Loy and rich girl Loretta Young ( who is already engaged ) . How will all this work out and will Ronald wise up and act like a responsible adult--these are the main themes of this pleasant little film.This isn 't a great movie and certainly won 't change your life , but it certainly is very entertaining and fun . Most of this is due to the always genial acting of Ronald Colman . Heck , in the heyday of his career in the 1930s , he could have played in REEFER MADNESS or some other dreck and still made it entertaining and likable due to his charming persona . His seemingly effortless style in this movie make it very easy to like him and it 's easy to see why both Loretta Young and Myrna Loy are in love with him in the film !

" This , and " " Hidden fortress " " are the Kurosawa 's that are most dear to me . I don 't hand out 10 's like candy , but this certainly deserved it , if anything . Even though it 's quite long ( like all Kurosawa 's pretty much are ) it concurred the problem which bugs me with most of his films ; the storyline is often too loose and slowly evolving , containing scenes that are unnecessary or just lenghtened too much without any real purpose to the storyline or the character description . Dodesukaden delivered to me the same experience that for example " " Hidden fortress " " did ; despite its lenght , there wasn 't a single minute I would cut out.This is also a very unusual Kurosawa film in a way , it has no storyline , but many little independent stories which are based more to the character description than storyline , unlike any other Kurosawa-film I have seen so far . It also leans much on the dialogue , which he uses brilliantly ( especially in the story between the father and the son planning their " " new house " " ) . Still the thing that makes this one a masterpiece is how the subject being so tragic as it is , is managed to be described so humanely and sympathetically , without pointing fingers at anybody at any point . From the beginning to the end it delivers the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" It isn 't always easy to explain what a movie is like , but this time I think I 've found it . It reminded me of two movies : Trainspotting ( small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in Schotland ) and The Blair Witch Project ( because of the style of filming ) .It 's about the loyalty between two friends , one of them is coming out of jail , the other one hasn 't been caught yet . With a stolen vehicle they drive through the Scottish countryside but than run out of petrol . As they try to find some fuel , they find a farm in the middle of nowhere . The farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them . Than it all goes wrong . One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer 's daughter and they have to run . What follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of Schotland . The two friends literally have to run for their lives.Apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time . OK , that 's not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place : the Scottish countryside , but I still find that quite amazing . Especially because this isn 't actually a bad movie . It 's perhaps not the greatest movie ever , but they still can be proud of what they achieved . I had a nice time watching it and overall I enjoyed the movie . I give it a 7 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Screened this morning for the press at Roma film festival , " " N - io e Napoleone " " is easy to love . First of all it can count on great production values , as very few Italian films nowadays can , with wonderful settings and costumes . The cast is great too . Director Virz챙 constantly speaks of the young lead Elio Germano as " " a young De Niro " . " Now , of course he is going a way too far , but sure the boy can act . I loved his performance , and he did a great job with the ( tuscan ) accent . Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and did very well as Bonaparte . It 's really great to see him acting in Italian , I hope to see him working in Italy again very soon . The supporting cast worked well too - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem unlikely choices , but they all gave fine performances . Even Massimo Ceccherini , best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy TV reality shows , fitted in well and was actually funny . The low point of the cast was the " " Diva " " Monica Bellucci . Sure , she was slightly better than usual , but she managed to look ( and sound ) utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa Emilia , in which , with a good dose of self irony , she used her own umbro accent . The script , by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virz챙 himself is clever , with lots of laugh out loud lines , and a few very emotional moments too . Sure , the ending left me puzzled . The message is kind of ambiguous : the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate , but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else , sometimes funny , sometimes sad , sometimes pathetic , so that suddenly it 's difficult to hate him ; then , in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning . Personally , I dislike very much this notion . " " Io e Napoleone " " is still a pleasant film , the best presented at the Festival so far ( the other being Fur and the Hoax ) . My rating is 8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Although , some things don 't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed . There were no mention about the holobands in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe I haven 't got far enough into the series for them to explain why.I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe , technology , and alternate fantasies of our world .

" " " Panic In The Streets " " is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Elia Kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in New Orleans , using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation . As a result , the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable . An important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster , provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken , then increase the tension to a high level.Following a dispute between the participants in a card game , a man called Kochak ( Lewis Charles ) is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area . When the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus , U.S. Public Health official Dr Clinton Reed ( Richard Widmark ) is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague . Reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action , anyone infected could be expected to die within days.As the identity of the dead man is unknown , the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the Police Commissioner are not fully convinced by Reed 's briefing . They doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently . The investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community , a group of seamen , the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man 's identity and his contacts are eventually found.Kochak , an illegal immigrant , had been in a gang with Blackie ( Jack Palance ) , Raymond Fitch ( Zero Mostel ) and Vince Poldi ( Tommy Cook ) and when gang leader Blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation , he presumes that Kochak must 've smuggled something very valuable into the country . As Kochak and Poldi were related , Blackie assumes that Poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more . Poldi , however , is very ill and unable to provide any information . Blackie brings in his own doctor and together with Fitch starts to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed and an exciting chase follows.Richard Widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man . In an unusual type of role for him , he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of Dr Reed very convincingly . Jack Palance 's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges Kochak 's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation . His distinctive looks also help to make his on-screen presence even more compelling.In typical docu-noir style , expressionist cinematography and neo-realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place . Elia Kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Two sorcerers battle in the fourth dimension , one ( Brian Thompson as a Kabal ) trying to destroy the Earth , the other ( Jeffrey Combs as a Anton Mordrid ) trying to save it . " " Doctor Mordrid " " is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese.The plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent , but the film is very short and entertaining.So if you have enough time to kill give this one a look.My rating : 7 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a musical adaptation of Dicken 's " " Oliver Twist " . " For the most part , the original story has been maintained , though for the flow of the film certain subplots ( such as the summer he spent recuperating and the half-brother ) are omitted . The biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book , Fagin is hanged--an ending very different from this musical film.This is a one of a kind musical--one whose style and scope really hasn 't been matched before or since . Not only are the songs often quite singable and memorable , but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold . Whereas in most musicals a few people or perhaps even a small group are choreographed dancing , here the numbers often run into the hundreds or perhaps more . It 's truly a sight to see and I was fortunate enough to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and is one of my earliest childhood memories . Having just seen it again a few moments ago , I would have to say that the film only got better over time . Great sets , wonderful acting and singing--this is a special treat that is hard not to love.By the way , when I saw the film again tonight , I was surprised by just how high and feminine Mark Lester 's singing was for the film . Well , according to IMDb , his singing was dubbed by a girl and this would definitely account for his voice . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's out of question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia . Apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance ( Anderson 's eyes are perceivably larger , lips thicker , nose larger and turned up at the end .... etc ) , Anderson 's unable to speak Russian was a ridiculous tell ...... That 's why I detest Anna Anderson and her confederates so much . Not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60 + years with such a blatantly untenable scheme.Yet to some extent I have sympathy for Anna Anderson . Life must have been hard for a young Polish peasant worker in those days . And to impersonate another woman for 60 + years is an arduous task for anybody.She had to hold back her fleshy lips all the time to mimic the thin lips of Anastasia 's , and had to occasionally go lunatic to make people believe all her chaotic memory was just a result of mental problem.Anna Anderson was an awesome woman on a wrong track . Had she put her good-looks , learned elegance , endurance , acting skills into proper use , she could of made a first-class actress.On a side note : Some main characters of this two-parter seem to be loosely based on real figures . Prince Erich could be a mixture of Gleb Botkin ( believed by many the most possible brain behind the whole scheme ) , Duke George and Dmitri of Leuchtenberg , and several other figures . And Darya Romanoff seem to be based on the gorgeous Princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova . But unlike the real confederates , Prince Erich was motiveless in this show and supported Anna out of love for and sincere belief in her , which is touching.On the whole this is a great show . Fictionalised a bit but still remains faithful to the reality . The power of Amy Irving 's acting lies in that she successfully represented Anderson 's self-assuredness , the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing . Just as Princess Xenia said about Anderson : " " She was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of acting a part . " " Highly recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Good horror movies from France are quite rare , and it 's fairly easy to see why ! Whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film , he emigrates towards glorious Hollywood immediately after to directed the big-budgeted remake of another great film classic ! How can France possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their prodigy-directors leave the country after just one film ? " " Haute Tension " " was a fantastic movie and it earned director Alexandre Aja a ( one-way ? ) ticket to the States to remake " " The Hills Have Eyes " " ( which he did terrifically , I may add ) . Eric Valette 's long-feature debut " " Mal챕fique " " was a very promising and engaging horror picture too , and he 's already off to the Hollywood as well to direct the remake of Takashi Miike 's ghost-story hit " " One Missed Call " . " So there you have it , two very gifted Frenchmen that aren 't likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon . " " Mal챕fique " " is a simple but efficient chiller that requires some patience due to its slow start , but once the plot properly develops , it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects . The film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters . We 're inside a ramshackle French prison cell with four occupants . The new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud , the elderly and " " wise " " inmate sadistically killed his wife and then there 's a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome . They find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell , belonging to a sick murderer in the 1920 's who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape . The four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre formulas of the book , only to realize the occult is something you shouldn 't mess with혚 Eric Valette dedicates oceans of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists , which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots , but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of Wishmaster-device . " " Mal챕fique " " is a dark film , with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior . Watch it before some wealthy American production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've known his name , I 've also looked for this movie . I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe , one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short , I bought it and watched it in France ! I was blown away , it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson 's first work. absolutely amazing character development , very thought provoking , great acting and the ultimate concept movie. if you are a concept movie fan this is one of the most original and classic . I feel as though it is a rare treat to see a movie like this one , its risky , its unorthodox , and ultimately its just downright unique. if you are a Luc Besson fan , its indeed a must see , however , whether your a Besson fan or not , its definitely an important work , overall a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked . The story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves , waves that are monstrously huge , waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves . There is nothing special about the film , other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk . Sure there are scenes of them surfing , but what makes this movie so special is the people . Here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching . Half way into this movie you 'll want to go off and learn to surf as well . Few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film .

" For those of you unfamiliar with Jimmy Stewart , this is one of his " " lesser " " films from later in his career . And , while it isn 't a great film compared to many of his other pictures , it isn 't bad and is a decent time-passer--but not much more.Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for some inexplicable reason , she decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy to make him fall in love with her . Over time , the cold and detached Ms. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart--and apparently in the witch 's rule book , this is a definite NO , NO ! ! The film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches . They are neither the baby-sacrificing nor the all-powerful variety . Most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless ( such as Jack Lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps ) . And , very oddly , the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz . Considering what I think of jazz , it must really stink to be a witch in this movie 's world ! Anyway , the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic , but not something I would rush out to watch . The acting is pretty good , but the script doesn 't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film--in fact , I almost scored the film a 6--it was really close . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" BLACK WATER has to be one of the best Australian movies I 've seen in many years . My girlfriend and I sat gripping each others hands , jumping in all the right spots . This is as much a crocodile film as OPEN WATER was a shark film . In other words , the creatures are merely part of the dilemma , the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances . How director 's Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich wring as much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is amazing to watch unfold . And when I say terror , its not overblown , artificially constructed squirm moments , but more little touches that when you ask yourself " " how would I feel in that situation " " lead you to conclude " " scared witless " . " Performances were great , the pacing and gorgeous cutaways to other life in the mangroves were excellent and the ending moments of the film felt very right . This is a fitting feature debut for two directors who should rightfully by very proud . Go and watch this very beautifully shot and acted suspenseful film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the start , at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick . But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college , running it accordingly . As you can expect , there 's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick . Bartleby Gaines ( Justin Long ) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately ' shove it to the system . ' The humour was varied which I loved .

" While I don 't agree with Bob 's and Tammy 's decision to give up baby Jesse , and it 's something I 'd never do , they were trying to do what was best for the baby . The way this movie is written , you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe , from all different aspects . Patty Duke ? Antagonist ? Almost unheard of , as far as I 'm concerned . But during the movie , she really convinces you that she 's psychotic , or at least , that there 's something seriously wrong with her . Her character is the meaning of " " emotionally disturbed . " " The movie seems to end quickly , leaving things somewhat unresolved . But other than that , this movie is really great . It really makes you think . It 's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that 'll make you laugh . But it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs , see things from others ' perspectives , and discover a little something about yourself . Caution : you may even grow while watching this movie ! And it 's all worth it , in the end . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The combination of reading the Novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and I to new levels . Recently I was pondering a statement made by the artist Thomas Kinkade in one of his inspirational books ; He states : " " You and I were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o 'clock traffic . Nor do I think God had banal television programs , media hype , worthless purchases , and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe ... " " I hadn 't seen " " A river runs through it " " in a couple of years , but after pondering Kinkade 's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye . I watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book ( a must read ) . I have always been frustrated in Southern California but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society . The film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience God 's creations . A combination of Macleans story and my desire to move back to the Northwest has driven me to move to Montana . I want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape , go fly-fishing with me , ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside . A place where you seldom worry about crime . I look around SoCal and all I see is shopping malls , rude snarling people in their Mercedez Bens , miles of vehicles on congested freeways , gangs , racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption , and everyone skeptical of each others intentions.Anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones . There is a lot of deep thinking in this film . The scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension . You should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life . It takes a compassionate , intelligent , and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning . If you don 't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue , tone , light , colour , scenery , camera angles / movement , etc . Then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks " " The Fast and the Furious " " is the greatest film . Granted it was entertaining but shallow.The bottom line : This film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses . Rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together . QUALITY NOT QAUNTITY , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the World War II years . When you 've got such stars as Gary Cooper , James Cagney , Doris Day , Gordon MacRae , and Randolph Scott , etc . , in the film and with such people as the Gershwin Brothers , Cole Porter , Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn supplying the music , it 's an easy to take film . And the plot isn 't even in the way.What plot there is involves two Air Force enlisted men , Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy , trying to meet Warner Brothers starlet Janice Rule using as a gimmick the fact that both come from Youngstown , Ohio and Hagerthy 's father was Rule 's dentist as well as half of the town 's . The scheme works too well as Louella Parsons is soon putting them as an item in her column . Yes , Louella 's in the film as well . She must have liked Warner Brothers or Jack Warner catered to her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to publicize her Hollywood Hotel radio program back in the day.But the rest of the plot also touched on the real life efforts of Ruth Roman also playing herself to get her studio and others to do shows at the Air Force bases for the servicemen and women going to Korea . Some of the names I 've mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at Travis Air Force Base where a lot of this film was shot.One specialty number was shot for the talents of Phil Harris who sing / narrates a ballad Look Out Stranger , I 'm A Texas Ranger aided and assisted by Virginia Gibson , Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper . Yup , Cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image.This is the oldest of clich챕s when you say they don 't make them like this any more , but they really don 't because you don 't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract . That 's one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The real surprise of this effortlessly lightweight movie is how such a top notch cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a hammy uninspiring affair . Presumably it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape . One can imagine that by the time Miranda Richardson got contacted by her agent , the conversation went along the lines of : ' Do you want to shoot a movie in Dublin scripted by Neil Jordan ? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already in ! ' This is a dull ' comedy ' that sees Michael Caine and Dylan Moran try and pull off a well-planned hustle where Moran must imitate a London gangland boss ( whose arrival is imminent ) to collect a sizeable sum of cash from local kingpin Michael Gambon . The rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly . Moran is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as Black Books . Caine is unchallenged in his role and gives a steady performance without being overstretched . One can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie - it can 't even have been a summer in Dublin given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background . Gambon actually steals the show , and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of Have I Got News For You will know that he is a wonderfully funny man . But overall the result is disappointing , and it seems a lifetime ago that Neil Jordan was making quality movies of the likes of Mona Lisa . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I don 't think it 's an accident that the bulk of the character 's name is spelled MORON.Good lines are sprinkled throughout the movie , with Peter Boyle , Griffit Dunne.Maurren Stapleton , Merilu Henner given good lines .

I can agree with other comments that there wasn 't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn 't a documentary !

Like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but I did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good.Despite it wasn 't a re-enactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade .

" I concur with what mallicka.b has said . The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content . Emotions aren 't conveyed properly . I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity . In my view , Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai . In some of her scenes , she looks a bit lusty , which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed . I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes .

" Sam Fuller 's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50 's Cold War-influenced low-budget noir vehicles . With a running length of under 80 minutes , PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough , gritty , explosive and endlessly entertaining.Widmark stars as pickpocket Skip McCoy , who has already been picked up three times . Yet McCoy can 't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble- and trouble is exactly what he slides into when he grifts the wallet of gangster 's moll Candy ( Jean Peters ) . Candy 's wallet contains a roll of microfilm invaluable to the Communist movement , and it 's her last job for ex-boyfriend Richard Kiley to make the delivery . However , when Widmark lifts it , Peters must do whatever it takes to re-claim the film she ( initially ) knows nothing about.It 's a tasty set-up , with Widmark 's character , while not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH , a real live-wire , unpredictable and tough , yet curiously charming.When Bogart or Mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get : a lone anti-hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end ( Bogart ) , or an overly-laconic guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap ( Mitchum ) . With Widmark you just don 't know what you are going to get , and with his incredibly modern acting style ( his films always hold up well ) he is amazing to watch . Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film , or handing it over to the police and fighting the " " Commies " " on the right side of the law . And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet.Peters gets her best role as the moll-with-a-heart-of-gold Candy . Widmark 's unpredictability is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with Peters ; the gorgeous tramp quickly ( and rather unbelievably- the romance angle is rather rushed ) falls under Widmark 's spell , yet Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around . Peters hard-edged beauty , yet lack of over-lacquered Hollywood glamour ( Lana Turner would never have worked well in this role ) , is a major asset to the film . Candy is not innocent , yet she 's very vulnerable , constantly being passed between and slapped around by men . Widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by pouring beer over her face , yet by the final act he 's a lot more tender to her ( after she cops one hell of a going-over from Kiley ) . The scene in the hospital with Peters and Widmark shouldn 't work , but it does.Thelma Ritter is brilliant as stoolie Moe , well-deserving of her Oscar nomination . Ritter 's performance , like everything else in the film , is gritty , real and heartbreakingly honest . Her death scene is stunning . Fuller 's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting . Fuller loved a good close-up , and PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is full of uncomfortable , cloistering tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot . Fuller isn 't afraid to let the camera linger on a shot for longer than standard Old-Hollywood really allowed , yet stunningly pulls away from Ritter 's death scene to give the audience maximum impact . The urban locales and unusual , confronting camera angles give PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET , a bold , uncompromisingly modern look.10 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This 1984 version of the Dickens ' classic ' A Christmas Carol , ' directed by Clive Donner , stars George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge . By this time around , the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again ; and , happily to say , with this film Donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it . He tells the story with precision and an eye to detail , and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative , especially Scott . One could argue that the definitive portrayal of Scrooge-- one of the best known characters in literary fiction , ever-- was created by Alastair Sim in the 1951 film ; but I think with his performance here , Scott has now achieved that distinction . There is such a purity and honesty in his Scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you 've seen Scott do it ; simply put , he IS Scrooge . And what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor ; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous . It is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well , to be able to make a character so real , from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face , and to make it all ring so true . It 's a study in perfection.The other members of the cast are splendid as well , but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of Scott 's performance ; and they do . Frank Finlay is the Ghost of Jacob Marley ; a notable turn , though not as memorable , perhaps , as the one by Alec Guinness ( as Marley ) in the film , ' Scrooge . ' Angela Pleasence is a welcome visage as the Spirit of Christmas Past ; Edward Woodward , grand and boisterous , and altogether convincing as the Spirit of Christmas Present ; and Michael Carter , grim and menacing as the Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come.David Warner hits just the right mark with his Bob Cratchit , bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by Scott 's Scrooge , and Susannah York fares just as well as Mrs. Cratchit . The real gem to be found here , though , is the performance of young Anthony Walters as Tiny Tim ; it 's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin , and simply one of the best interpretations-- and the most real-- ever presented on film.The excellent supporting cast includes Roger Rees ( Fred Holywell , and also the narrator of the film ) , Caroline Langrishe ( Janet Holywell ) , Lucy Gutteridge ( Belle ) , Michael Gough ( Mr. Poole ) and Joanne Whalley ( Fan ) . A flawless presentation , this version of ' A Christmas Carol ' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged ; no matter how many versions you may have seen , watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever . And forever after , whenever you think of Scrooge , the image your mind will conjure up will be that of George C. Scott . A thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience , this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home . I rate this one 10 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really enjoyed " " Doctor Mordrid " . " This is a low-budget film , which may be off-putting to some , but I have no problem with it . I admire it even more for that , considering it 's WAY more entertaining than the drivel that Hollywood churns out every year . Too bad this didn 't get a theatrical release ; I don 't know about anyone else , but I would have went to see it in theatres . ' Doctor Mordrid ' is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy , especially if they 're into sci-fi like I am . I don 't see why this is a R-rated film ; only one f-word is said , and there are no gruesome death scenes , nor is there any blood at all . The timeless rivalry between sorcerers Anton and Kabal ( Anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race , while Kabal wanted to enslave them ) , gave the story a sense of enchantment , while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself . Basically , this a film that 's just plain fun to watch . There is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie , though : seeing Jeffrey Combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit . That makes me laugh every time I see it . But I digress ... Anyway , the acting is great ; the main protagonists ( Anton , and his lady friend , Samantha ) , are very likable ; Anton is sympathetic , and hospitable , and Samantha is friendly . Plus , the settings were wonderful . The floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting ; we 're only given a glimpse of it twice , though ; it would have been great to see more scenes take place here . The main setting was also very neat ; Anton 's apartment is very roomy , and he has some cool devices , especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the world 's occurrences . He even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named Edgar . Overall , this a great film ; it was fun to watch , and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles . If you can find anywhere that rents ' Doctor Mordrid ' , you should rent it ( or , in my case , buy it . It was definitely money well-spent ) ! My Rating : 8 stars out of ten . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" After a couple years of searching for the Humphrey Bogart film , " " Two Against the World " , " it unexpectedly showed up as a TCM offering under the title " " One Fatal Hour " , " a First National film from 1936 . Bogey 's character is Sherry Scott , the man who runs WUBC , a radio station whose program lineup is losing listeners . The owner Bertram Reynolds ( Robert Middlemass ) , is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station , but hides behind his decisions by pawning them off on Scott.In an effort to boost the audience base and revenues , Reynolds has the idea of reviving a twenty year old murder case , and offering it as a fifteen chapter radio play . Scott enlists the aid of Dr. Martin Leavenworth ( Harry Hayden ) to write the play and present it on the air.The Pembroke Murder case involved a woman who was acquitted of murdering her husband , the circumstances of which are not made clear . However Gloria Pembroke has married , and is now living as Martha Carstairs ( Helen MacKellar ) , married to a successful banker ( Henry O 'Neill ) , and their daughter Edith ( Linda Perry ) is about to be married ( on the same day no less as the radio play is to reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke ) . About to be faced with the devastating effects of this revelation , Martha and Jim Carstairs embark on a crusade to have the program stopped . Simultaneously , Edith 's future in-laws respond by demanding that the marriage not take place.Without revealing the final outcome , the film takes a devastating turn to jolt the viewer . Edith Carstairs confronts the principals of the radio station , vigorously admonishing Scott and the sniveling Reynolds . While accepting his share of the blame for the outcome , Scott partially redeems himself by quitting his job , firing his secretary , and hauling her out of the office , recognizing her for the conscience he once had . With an entirely abrupt finish , the film leaves one as disoriented and unsettled as any movie that doesn 't have a happy ending . With about a dozen films under his belt , Humphrey Bogart gets a chance to take center stage here with intriguing results . With no name supporting players , Bogey rises to the occasion by taking charge in the confines of the radio offices , and runs the show as if it was his own . In an interesting bit of characterization , he expresses his exasperation by crossing his hands over his bowed head , predating by a half dozen years a similar effect we 'll see him do in " " Casablanca " . " For Bogart fans , it 's a genuine treat to catch an unexpected nuance like this . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really , really enjoyed watching this movie ! At first , seeing its poster I thought it was just another easy romantic comedy ... but it is simply more than this ! I personally believe that this idea ( that I 'm sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie ) it 's yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself ( or even of its marketing strategy ) ! What I mean is : Nowadays we are slaves to images ! To impressions ! I went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression , the wrong expectations , and at the end I felt how superficial I could be ! To exemplify it comes to my mind the sequence near the end in which Sidney buys the plane ticket to go back to New York and as he is asked to ' give an autograph ' , meaning to sign for the ticket , he believes that just because he got on TV thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now some kind of celebrity . And this is just , I believe , the climax of this main theme around which the movies revolves . Above this , I believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this , illustrated throughout the movie by Sidney 's attitude : don 't become too serious about yourself or about anybody else ... " " even saints were people in the beginning " " ... as Sophie once says in the movie . The saints of the moment are the stars . We attribute them an ' aura ' of perfection , of eternal happiness , but the reality is much less than that . Even the saints of any religion are images , ideal models of how to behave and how to live your life . Even they were not for real ... they became ' for real ' after they died and we looked back at them . And that 's the catch : we need our saints ! we need our stars ! We strive for them as if it wasn 't for them we wouldn 't have anything to strive for . And television and all other media are means to create and capture our strivings . We desperately need benchmarks in regard to which to measure ourselves . And that 's how we got in the cinema to watch this movie in the first place : to see if we can fit the benchmark , or if the benchmark is to small for us . This time it was larger than we expected . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The humor implicit in the complete title proverb derives from the Sunday School dictum that one would be better advised to prepare before you 're dead for the Devil 's scrutiny , i.e. so the Devil doesn 't care when you 're dead . There 's no percentage in trying to Beat the Devil . The characters apparently didn 't pay attention at Sunday School , and find themselves forced into crisis management , having eschewed crisis avoidance . But even a seasoned CEO would have difficulty managing these crises . Throwing dice is far more unpredictable than flipping a coin ; when people are involved , the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable Sidney Lumet films . Until now , Hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor but here perhaps had an eye toward earning billing among other Lumet All Stars like Steiger and Pacino . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I thought this film was excellent , quirky and different to the usual run of the mill ' disengaged cop catching serial killer ' film . Kiefer Sutherland was brilliant as usual - I really don 't think I have seen anything that he has done where he has not acted brilliantly . The dialogue was funny at times lightening the mood , and the plot engaging . Thanks to other reviewers for showing the link with Alice in Wonderland - I hadn 't picked up on those . I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Kiefer Sutherlands ( as I am ) and to anyone who wants to watch an entertaining film for a couple of hours . It was a shame that it wasn 't released at the cinemas for a wider audience . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The unlikely duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in The Angel Levine . It 's one interesting twist on the themes from It 's A Wonderful Life.Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly Jewish poor in New York . Mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade , but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working . Kaminsky is mostly bedridden . He 's reduced to applying for welfare . In desperation like Jimmy Stewart , he cries out to God for some help.Now maybe if he had gotten someone like Henry Travers things might have worked out differently , but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers . But Travers had one thing going for him , he was over 100 years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone . God sent Mostel something quite different , the recently deceased Harry Belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignment.Belafonte hasn 't accepted he 's moved on from life , he 's still got a lot of issues . He also has a wife , Gloria Foster , who doesn 't know he 's passed on , hit by a car right at the beginning of the film . You put his issues and Mostel 's issues and you 've got a good conflict , starting with the fact that Mostel can 't believe in a black Jew named Levine.This was the farewell performance for Polish / Jewish actress Ida Kaminsky who got a nomination for Best Actress in The Shop on Main Street a few years back . The other prominent role here is that of Irish actor Milo O 'Shea playing a nice Jewish doctor . Remembering O 'Shea 's brogue from The Verdict , I was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctor.The Angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society . It 's brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer Bernard Malamud . Make sure to catch it when broadcast . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just can 't believe some of the comments on this show ! The show is just genius ! Sure it doesn 't follow the tried and true , but do we as consumers always want the same things thrust at us over and over again . Shouldn 't we have the option to sit back and enjoy something new once in a while . The style is not as realistic as previous " " Scooby Doo " " shows , but it 's not supposed to be . The show it titled " " Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue " " what part of that title states that the entire beloved cast of other renditions would constantly join in the action . And nowhere does it say that they 'd be solving mysteries , and they can 't even stand monsters , so why would they ? I 'm actually glad that they put some long standing plot points that work into a Scooby-Doo show . They still have running jokes , clumsy hi-jinks , quick-change outfits in chase scenes , the standard hallway gag and even Scooby snacks . In fact I 'm glad that this show is out there , because I just love it . I 'm even glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and concentrated on just two main characters and a villain.Sure it 's ridiculous , it 's supposed to be ! Sure it 's different , it 's supposed to be . It 's supposed to make you laugh at the villain , and cheer for the idiotic robotic butler to triumph over all intruding vermin , no matter what the size . You 're supposed to get the running " " Roobi-Roo " " joke . The whole thing is just put together so well , there isn 't a single thing I can think that is WRONG with it .

" Writer / Director John Hughes covered all bases ( as usual ) with this bitter-sweet " " Sunday Afternoon " " family movie . " " Curly Sue " " is a sweet , precocious orphan , cared for from infancy by " " Bill " . " The pair live off their wits as they travel the great US of A. Fate matches them with a " " very pretty " " yuppie lawyer , and the rest is predictable.Kids will love this film , as they can relate to the heroine , played by 9 year old Alisan Poter ( who went on to be the " " you go girl ! " " of Pepsi commercials ) . The character is supposed to be about 6 or 7 , as she is urged to think about going to school . Some of her vocabulary suggests that she is every day of 9 or older.Similar to " " Home Alone " , " there is plenty of slap-stick and little fists punching big fat chins . Again , this is " " formula " " film making , aimed at a young audience . Entertaining and heartwarming .

I would have given you a 10 for excellent , but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself . Of course , that is the only bad thing on this documentary . Too bad Justin does not look for Melinda Culea ( " " Amy A. Allen " " ) . But it is great to see Mr. T. back into action . Too bad for him , he does not show up at the party , at the end .

" A kooky , but funny bit of diversion . You kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what 's happening , but each report to earth has it 's own little joke . Pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi t.v. show . It 's fun to watch . Sort of in the vein of Red Dwarf , but even more low budget . For someone who 's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes , what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent , because they 've been moved up the ladder of command , because the other officers died . Also , the main guys are from the laundry corps , which is why they have laundry in everything . If you like Red Dwarf , you 'll probably like this . Slightly different t.v. concept , in that all you see is the Commander 's report each day.It would be better if this were explained more , not just in the very beginning of the first episode , but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in Red Dwarf too , if you hadn 't been told . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
OK so some of the plot points might be a bit obvious but over all an interesting idea which works towards a tight ending . The acting is solid particularly Lachy Hulme who plays one of the central characters in this ensemble piece . He certainly has a screen presence and he is interesting to watch . It has a low budget feel which works for the sort of thriller / horror genre Four Jacks belongs to . The film doesn 't try to take itself to seriously which adds to the overall charm . The character of Phil ( Dave Serrafin ) has to be one of the most annoying character seen on screen since Rupert Pupkin / King of Comedy .

The serenity , the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really exlusively , I never met such proximity it in any movie before.Another thing left in my mind after the film - this is the movie , closest to the original books , and atmosphere in it .

" Captain Willard ( Martin Sheen ) has been sent on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz ( Marlon Brando ) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders . And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces , it is hard for Capt. Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has , killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands . What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top ? Through Willard 's long journey through the jungle to find his target , he tries with some success to understand why . But what will he decide to do once he finds him ? Any movie that can start out with The Doors ' " " The End " " is a great movie in my book , especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song . Apocalypse Now does this perfectly . I can 't think of anything better for it to be set to , the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders ' minds that it created . AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam , the ultimate destination of which is murder . Through it 's use of music and score alone , we are thrown into a dark world of mystery , violence , and insanity . A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here . An overall great cast , with the exception of Laurence Fishburne , of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread . I just don 't like Fishburne , ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee 's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold . I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care . We need to sick Gary Oldman on him . Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can 't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence . Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general . My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall 's Lt. Colonel Kilgore . Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it 's my favorite of his parts to date . He simply nailed his character , which is one of the best in the entire film , as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf . Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant . I also love the smell of napalm in the morning.The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn 't take too much brainpower to figure out what 's going on . Willard 's mission is to kill Kurtz , plain and simple . But it 's the journey of the film that is really it 's heart and also the dire situations of war itself . In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film 's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey . I don 't feel they take away anything though , it 's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original . Through this journey , the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it ... in fact , that 's the entire point . On top of that , the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz ' to go completely mad . A big war movie lover , this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter , all of them classics . I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I 've said . All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War .... so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless ... even if after having most recently view AN I think it 's a tad better . In the end , Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it 's been given . As a fellow reviewer has previously stated , AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I liked this movie because it basically did more with less . It could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more ( though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop ) .The guy playing the DJ did a good job of showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memories . I also found his dialog with the callers pretty funny.While parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away , other parts you do not expect to turn out the way they did.I thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part , concentrating more on the living side of the equation . The last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is being revealed.While it was a shorter movie , it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story . Any more and it would have started to drag . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie is excellent . Not because it does anything special or new , but because it is consistently great in all of its parts . No part stands out as being " " ground-breaking " " or " " stellar " , " but all parts are far above mediocre , and that makes , to me , an excellent movie.I own several copies of this movie , and may acquire it on collectors DVD or Blu-Ray , someday ( holding off right now due to high blu-ray prices , and of course the face that I don 't have a blu-ray player ... but that 's beside the point of this review ) .It stars off sort of ordinary , but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension , some action , strongly portrayed characters , and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very end.Wait , no , it does NOT start out ordinary.It starts out sort of like what a Qun . Tar. movie WISHES it could be . With an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes ... very , very wrong.By the end of the movie , nothing was as it seemed , and a few people are dead , and a few people are very rich . I won 't tell you who ... watch and enjoy ! Overall rating : 10 / 10 , A * * , Excellent ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Marriage of Maria Braun ( MMB ) is about a German girl ( Maria ) getting married to a German soldier ( Herman Braun ) just at the ending of the war . After being married for half a day and a night , Herman is send to the front again . To make ends meet , Maria starts working at a bar for mainly American soldiers and get to know a black soldier . She got word that Herman died at the front , and things develop between her and the American soldier . Herman walks in on them , in bed , and after a confrontation between him and the American , Maria killed the American . Herman admits to the murder , ends up in jail and Maria vows to wait for him . The country is in shambles ; one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette . There are food shortages . It is in short , a time of survival of the fittest . Basically this film projects Maria 's attitudes - those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances , as a metaphor for Germany 's loss of soul after they lost the war , and how it proceeds to rebuild itself . For example , Maria has the following conversation with a peddler ( played by Fassbinder himself ) ; the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of Kleist and she remarks that " " Kleist burns out to quickly , it does not provide enough heat for the cold " . " The peddler answers " " That 's another way to look at it . Right now , it 's probably the correct way " . " Maria meets a French / German business man , Karl Oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment . She decides to get involve with Karl , " " You 're not having an affair with me ; I 'm having an affair with you " . " She also takes responsibility in the company , and after a while has the complete trust of the firm . When Karl says " " I suppose we 'll just have to wait for a miracle " " she replies " " I prefer making miracles 혯 then wait for them " . " In her own words , she has become the " " Mata Hari of the economic miracle " . " In a lot of Fassbinder 's films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms ( see Freud ) ; in other words , he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh * t , the false social mechanisms , the pretending . The direct approach Maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology . For example , she phones Karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point " " I need someone to sleep with " . " As Fassbinder said " " the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society " . " He also remarked that his films are anti emotional . I particularly liked the scene when Karl and Maria meet in the Munich restaurant ( apparently , frequently visited by Hitler himself ) . Maria appears in control and Karl a bit on the down side , as if Maria 's ' brutal honesty ' wears him out , as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore . Karl says " " I have to tell myself over and over that I love life " . " Maria replies " " That 's life isn 't it . As if we signed a contract to enjoy life . And then we go out to eat and talk about food " . " I guess this is also about Fassbinder attitudes on relationships , to never submit completely to anyone . And why would you , if the central matter of most of his films is about " " What love becomes in this society 혯 a commodity , an instrument of power , a weapon . " " It was remarked that it is typical Fassbinder to have the scenes with Maria and Betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war - with these clothing essentially the wrong period . What I think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes , when you feel bad , that " " you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great " . " But , Fassbinder was not interested in perfection . Any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project . Since he completed films ( approximately 4 a year ) the way other people rolled cigarettes , it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes . Peter Marthesheimer , who wrote most of the script , mentioned that Fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with Maria and the American in the park , overnight . Hanna Schygulla is brilliant as Maria . Mostly , she just stares bluntly into the camera . In Maria 's own words " " It is a bad time for emotions . But , I like it like that " . " There are different opinions about the end . After Karl died of a hart attack , Herman finally shows up . ( Herman left for Australia after he got out of prison , to " " become human again " . " ) After the testament is delivered ( made out to her and Herman in half ) , Maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette , and blow her and Herman up . For me it is obvious that she just did that by accident . At the same time , she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true . She must have felt as if she was not herself anymore . She felt as if she had outlived herself . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" After seeing the movie last night I was left with a sense of the hopelessness faced by organisations trying to tackle the problem the film portrays . The scale of the prostitution seems so large that it 's hard to see how it can be defeated without major governmental changes in Cambodia.Anyway , on with the review.Although it is a sombre movie with an uncomfortable central relationship this is a very compelling film , and I 'd even go so far as to say it was enjoyable . The film was well edited for the running time and the performance by Thuy Nguyen was excellent . I also felt Ron Livingston played a very difficult role well.It would have been nice to have a little more insight into why Patrick feels he has to help Holly , but maybe the reason is a simple as he explains to Chris Penn 's character . I won 't explain it here - go see the movie.This is a good , thought-provoking film with obviously good intentions . I hope it gets a wide enough release to reach a decent sized audience and gain more support for the K-11 Project . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A couple of years back I had purchased ( and enjoyed ) the MGM double-feature DVD of the two Kolchak TV movies , THE NIGHT STALKER ( 1971 ) and THE NIGHT STRANGLER ( 1972 ) . When the Universal set of the subsequent TV series came out , I had intended to buy it immediately ? ? but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded DVD-18s kept me from adding it to my collection ; recently , I placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted Universal Box Sets and decided to pick up the KOLCHAK 3-Discer as well.Having watched it now , I can safely say that I didn ? 셳 regret acquiring this beloved ( if short-lived ) crime / horror series one bit : it may follow a standardized formula ? ? dogged and resourceful newspaperman Carl Kolchak , marvelously played by Darren McGavin , gets into everybody ? 셲 hair with his attitude ( flustered editor Simon Oakland , long-suffering colleagues , assorted authoritarian figures , a plethora of monsters and villains ) , faces up to the inevitable ( and usually supernatural ) threat alone but , finally , is pressured into keeping his story under wraps ? ? but a winning one ( further boosted by an impressive line-up of guest stars and notable behind-the-scenes credits ) , making the show a great deal of fun.That said , quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make-up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired ( for instance , the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment ) ? ? not to mention the fact that these were restricted to 50-minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes ( in the case of the werewolf , again , he ? 셲 never seen biting anyone but , somewhat foolishly , is made to merely throw people around ) ! While the hero ? 셲 cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots , there ? 셲 a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode ( often , but not exclusively , revolving around McGavin ? 셲 relationship with either Oakland or geeky reporter Jack Grinnage ) ? ? to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere ( the setting , for the most part , is Chicago ) and suspense . To make the ride even more pleasant , there ? 셲 a bouncy score by Gil Melle ' and Jerry Fielding.For the record , the monsters encountered ( but not always defeated ) by Kolchak throughout the series are : a revived Jack The Ripper , a variety of cults ( voodoo , Native American , Aztec ) , aliens , vampire , werewolf ( going round its over-familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise-liner ! ) , doppelganger , Satanist , swamp creature , mass of electricity , robot , apeman , witch , headless motorcyclist , succubus , a knight ? 셲 armor taking a murderous life of its own ( the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast ? ? featuring John Dehner as a morose police captain , Hans Conried and Robert Emhardt ) , Helen Of Troy ( ! ) and crocodile . Some of the actors ( other than those playing Kolchak ? 셲 co-workers ) return in the same roles ? ? Keenan Wynn and Ramon Bieri ( both as officers of the law ) , John Fiedler ( as a shrewd morgue attendant ) and Richard Kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero . If I were pressed to choose the finest ( or most entertaining ) episodes , I ? 셝 lean towards HORROR IN THE HEIGHTS ( co-starring Phil Silvers and Abraham Sofaer ) and the afore-mentioned THE KNIGHTLY MURDERS ? ? while , as the weakest , I ? 셝 go for THE WEREWOLF ( due to reasons I ? 셶e already explained ) and CHOPPER ( based on a story concocted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale ! ) .Unfortunately , the set contains no extras : it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in KOLCHAK : THE NIGHT STALKER , as well as putting the series into the context of where TV was at the time of its original airing , or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci-fi series popular today . In fact , Kolchak himself ? ? in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise ? ? returned in a 2005 revival ; this version is available at my local DVD rental outlet ? 쫇ut , for various reasons , I ? 셫 not sure I ? 셝 want to check it out so soon after the 1974-5 classic ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie just felt very true to life . I liked the ending which seemed to resolve naturally without any big moments but with a lot of little moments coming together . You could tell it is an honest love story . It doesn 't matter what the ' sexual orientation ' of the main characters are , it still a story about love and understanding.There were a lot of scenes that involved the family . The setting is during what for some people is a very stressful time . Namely " " the holidays . " " Christmas to be precise . Like most good films , this one addresses issues of love , fitting in , expectations , and can 't-be-overcome biases . In the end Alexandra and Casey make a choice for each other , knowing that love is difficult , and about giving . Well done . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" [ Minor spoilers follow ] Steve Allen opined that topical humor about serious events might be found by many to be acceptable based on the formula : Tragedy + Time = Comedy . 1939 before the German assault on Poland was hardly a fun period and subsequent events , including the Blitzkrieg ( following the Sitzkrieg ) which took Germany to the Channel , resulted in the heroic evacuation at Dunkirk and gave the world the sickening spectacle of a supine France prostrating its honor before the Nazi conqueror.The stuff of romance , comedy and a big dollop of serious drama ? Yep . Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau , with a well-matched and outstanding cast , creates in " " Bon voyage " " a pastiche of events and scenes from history and from imagination that is hugely entertaining.Viviane Denvers ( the sloe-eyed and beautiful Isabelle Adjani ) is France 's top actress as war clouds gather over Europe ( what an overused cliche , sorry ) . A veteran self-venerating bedhopper with many affairs to her credit , her inner motivation seems to be " " Whatever is good for Viviane is good for ... Viviane ) . Following a premiere of her latest film after which a minister in the incompetent Reynaud administration , Jean-Etienne Beaufort ( Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him ) , signals his interest in her , she goes home only to tiredly encounter an ex-lover who doesn 't understand the word " " no . " " She decisively resolves that issue but then frantically and histrionically enlists another former beau , the still besotted Frederic ( Gregory Derangere ) , to help deal with the mess in her flat . Frederic is a novelist-in-expectation.A comic accident that once again highlights , almost as a public service message , the importance of working windshield wipers puts Frederic in jail on most serious charges . Fortunately the breakout of the Germans from their static positions forces a wholesale transfer of prisoners to the south of France but our boy escapes , making his way there privately rather than as a ward of the state.The panic and fear in France as the Germans swept to victory is well portrayed and a new twist enters the story . Who should Frederic encounter but the truly gorgeous young research assistant , Camille ( Virginie Ledoyen ) who is accompanying the obligatory Jewish refugee scientist , Professor Kopolski ( Jean-Marc Stehle ) . Kopolski has some bottles of " " heavy water " " he needs to get to England . Of course the Germans musn 't latch on to this vital ingredient for you know what ( this part is pure fiction-there was never any heavy water in France in 1940-just Perrier ) . And Camille is so winsome as well as dedicated.What next ? Peter Coyote as a supposed French journalist , Alex Winckler . Be tipped off as to his name . He 's really an officer in the Abwehr ( German military intelligence : a spy ) . And he used to bed Viviane too ( and wants a reprise of their affair ) . Apparently the kind Kopolski is the only major male character who doesn 't want to have it off with the actress.What follows is a series of adventures and mishaps that are seamlessly integrated to produce a very fast-paced and enjoyable film . Partly a tribute to and a bit of a spoof on " " Casablanca , " " this is is a remarkably funny movie ( except for the heavy Nazi bits ) .Isabelle Adjani deserves kudos for the best portrayal I 've seen in years of an adorably cute total narcissist with few if any redeeming features . And Depardieu , disloyal to Reynauld and ready to jump ship and join the traitor , Petain , is convincing as a man whose ardor for Viviane exceeds his diluted sense of duty to the Republic . As a human being in power at a critical moment in French history , Beaufort is mundanely vile.Not shown in too many theaters , " " Bon voyage " " should be available for purchase or rental soon . See it ! 9 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about Liebe des Totes ( the love of the dead ) or something similar . This of course awoke my curiosity so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking ( The Death King ) . The Nekromantik movies are Ok , even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject Necrophilia ( even if they obviously are horror-opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind , they are actually quite funny . ) TODESKING , on the other hand is , in my opinion , one of the best films ever made . It consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death . Death as an enemy ; Death as a reliever , Death as the very fysical decomposition of the body . The film is a metaphor over life . It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are . It reduces its viewers to the childs they ( we ) actually are . The fact that we cannot really understand the nature of Death , and hence neither the process of dying , is the core message of the film . This is a most realistic film . Never does Buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever . No matter what moral standards you set up , death is unevitable , and will sooner or later be not a fiction but YOUR reality . This applies to YOU , Dear Reader , like it applies to the viewers of the film . Some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this , which is fully excused , since they of course will live forever ... This is no exploitation movie . Why ? Because death does not exploit us humans . It harvests us . We grow for seven days , then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre-birth , that is Death . Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales . Whether you choose to regard it as " " optimistic " " or " " pessimistic " " is up to you . At first glance it may seem very dark . Consider though , that in order for something to live , something else must die . " " Who wants to live forever ? " " I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body , that are being consumed by maggots , he shows not only decomposition , but GENERATION of new life . Is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil , than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre ? When you realize this , you see Der Todesking it its right context.Sieben Tage hat die Woche , siebenmal letzte Stunden . Seven are the days of week ( weak , mortal ! ) , seven times the last hour.Dont fear the Reaper , Buttgereit tells us , because the Reaper takes only what is ripe . And apples that are not plucked for food will rot ! Have a good life , fellow IMDB 'ers !

" I have loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979 . I 'm still amazed at how accurately Kurt Russell portrays Elvis , right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face . Sometimes its scary how much he looks , acts , and talks like the real Elvis . Thankfully this is being released on DVD , so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film . I have heard the detractors , who say that there are some inaccuracies , or some things left out , but I think that keeping in mind that John Carpenter only had about 2 1 / 2 hours to work with , and that this was being shown on television ( just two years after Elvis 's death ! ) that he did a fine job with this . In fact I haven 't seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to this one . Highly recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of David Lynch 's Twin Peaks - a show which I adore . The show quickly starts introducing us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is to me the best of the lot , its extremely dramatic and really gets out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season . My one biggest criticism is I felt a little let down by the show - probably not through its own fault , as it got cancelled after a mere 1 season , it seemed to display show much potential and it deserved a lot better treatment than it got . The acting is excellent , and this show has some of the best characters ( good and evil ) in it I have ever seen that are well developed in a short space of time . There is the odd cheesy effect for the first 5 or ten shows which are a bit overly dramatic , but this is rectified as the season progressed . Well worth a watch , definitely something out of the ordinary ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yes , this IS a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun ! That 's because although the film clearly was horror , some of the stories had a light spirit--and there were even occasionally a few laughs . This isn 't at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious . Because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good , it 's one of the better movies of this style I have seen.The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself . Four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants.The first segment starred Denholm Elliott as a horror writer who has writer 's block . So , for a change of scenery , they rent this house . Almost immediately Elliott 's block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer . Amazingly , soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character ! Again and again , the psychotic killer appears and then disappears--making it seem as if he is losing his mind . This might just be the best of the stories , as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive.The second , while not bad at all , is probably the weakest . Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago ( though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary ) . When he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town , he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this . Later , a friend ( Joss Ackland ) visits and he , too , sees the figure and is entranced by it . This all leads to an ending that , frankly , was a bit of a letdown.Christopher Lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl . During most of this segment , Lee seemed like an idiot , but in the end you can understand his demeanor . Though slow , this one ended very well.The fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre . Jon Pertwee ( the third " " Doctor " " from the DR. WHO television series ) is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of Dracula . However , nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique , he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film . It 's actually pretty interesting that he played this role , as it seemed like a natural for Christopher Lee who played Dracula or other vampires a bazillion times ( give or take a few ) . I enjoyed Pertwee 's line when he basically said that Lee 's and other recent incarnations of Dracula were all crap compared to Bela Lugosi 's ! Perhaps this is why Lee didn 't take this part ! Despite some very silly moments , it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segment.Considering that the film started and ended so well , had excellent acting and writing , it 's hard not to like this film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's generally an accepted fact that Marcel Carn챕 's 1936-1946 movies are masterpieces and it 's considered polite to say that the rest are mediocrities.This is an unfair opinion : at least , two of the latter era are eminently watchable : " " Th챕r챔se Raquin " " , his best post-war work , and " " les tricheurs " " ( the cheats ) .There 's a strange evolution from the Prevert golden hour to " " les tricheurs " " : in " " les enfants du paradis " " " " quai des brumes " " or " " le jour se l챔ve " , " true love is thwarted by the villains . In " " les tricheurs " " true love does not exist anymore : we deal with a bunch of young people who believe in nothing ; falling in love would be incongruous for this youth.The adults are not the villains at all : Mic 's brother and mother are kind people , but she is beyond their command.Very few grown-ups appear anyway.During two hours , the characters do not stop playing around , dancing , listening to jazz records ( a music which was not still part of the bourgeois culture ) , and heavily drinking .When two of them discover they care for each others , it will be too late.The cast is rather good , Laurent Terzieff as an existentialist cynic and Andr챕a Parisy as a rich kid are the stand-outs.On the other hand , Pascale Petit and mainly Jacques Charrier ( who married Brigitte Bardot the same year as " " les tricheurs " " ) do not possess the ambiguity their parts ask for.They are all smile , too sweet and to nice to be believable.Oddly , " " les tricheurs " " was labeled " " nouvelle vague " " !

" Wow , this movie was absolutely brilliant . I really don 't know why everyone says it has a slow pace . I thought the pace was perfect . The movie is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit-man / killer working for John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) . He disslikes this job but does it because Rooney payed for his house and helps him financially . He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything . But , his children are unaware that this is his job , and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him , he is placed in an awkward position . And when an atrocity occurs , he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge . They rob abanks and much more and build a bond . They 're the perfect team .

" Season after season , the players or characters in this show appear to be people who you 'd absolutely love to hate . Is this show rigged to be that or were they chosen for the same ?

You enjoy seeing them screwing others , getting screwed themselves , playing dirty , getting it back , escaping and finally getting kicked out by Trump .

" " " Putney Swope " " is a unique , low low low budget gem from the late 1960 's which probably would have been forgotten in time if it hadn 't been for two things : Paul Thomas Anderson ( who named Don Cheadle 's character in " " Boogie Nights " , " Buck Swope , after the eponymous hero of this film ) and the limited DVD release . Watching " " Putney Swope " " is like listening to hardcore punk rock : it may not make a lot of sense ( at least to me it didn 't upon watching it for the first time ) , but you have to respect the film for its passion and unabashedly rebellious message . I didn 't understand a lot of things about " " Putney Swope " , " but for the most part , I liked it . The more I think about the movie , the more it grows on me.The film is advertised as a parody of New York 's Madison Avenue , best known in the 1960 's as the advertising capital of the world . Members of Generation X and Y may be lost on this concept , but fortunately " " Mad Men " " is on TV to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of U.S. History . What you need to know before watching this movie is that these ad agencies were largely male , and even more largely white establishments.With this premise in mind , the movie opens up with an ad agency board meeting . The members are predominantly white except for Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson , who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dick Gregory in this film ) , the token African-American on the board . The board members are so self-absorbed and soulless that when their chairman falls dead in front of them , their only concern is who will become chairman next . Without even removing the body from the boardroom , they begin a paper ballot to elect the next chairman.Putney Swope is elected by a landslide , but not because the other members think Swope is qualified . Voting for Swope was an ill-fated attempt for these board members to sabotage any other member 's chance of being elected chairman . With their plans backfired , Swope takes charge and " " sink ( s ) the boat " , " firing all but one of the original members and hiring all people of color in their place .After this point , the film became ( for me ) very weird and hard to follow plot-wise . There may not have even been a plot , really . The whole idea of the film seems to be a " " what if " " scenario , with the result being that the new " " Truth and Soul Inc . " " firm would be unconventional , but successful nonetheless . The firm ends up making so much money that the members build a huge glass case to keep the cash in for unexplained purposes . It could be because Swope doesn 't trust banks , although that point is not touched upon or explained in the film . It could also be metaphoric in some way , but who knows.Most of the movie takes place inside the ad agency , with occasional scenes in the White House with a president who , for some unknown reason , is a midget . My assumption is here that some political joke was being made , but I can 't figure out what . Were the filmmakers saying that the president is a small , insignificant part of American life ? Were they saying that the latest elected officials ( Nixon at the time ) were insignificant candidates ? I don 't know . I found it a bit eerie , however , that the man playing the president bore a striking resemblance to future president Ronald Reagan . It is funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie was made.What this film may have benefited from is showing how consumers outside the ad agency reacted to the new ads . Of course , the ad footage possessed a strange , funny appeal for its unconventional creativity , but did these ads convince people to buy the product ? If so , how ? The movie hinted on the idea that the new ad campaign was successful through client interaction and the calls from the White House . However , it would have been revealing to see average people , since that demographic has always been most profitable for advertisers.Although the parodies and political messages this film may have made probably didn 't stand the test of time , this film still had a lot of unique qualities . Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor to him that benefited him greatly in this film . Swope 's rough voice was actually director Robert Downey , Sr. ' s voice dubbed in , sometimes poorly , but fit the character so well in being an authoritative outsider . He hires and fires workers at random , but earns the respect of all but one of the employees for revolutionizing the ad agency and seeking out new ideas.The premise of the film was , and still is , incredibly risky , especially since the film was written and directed by a white man ( Robert Downey , Sr. ) . However , this film declines to fall victim to negative black stereotypes which would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later . Although some of the sex scenes may be a bit off-putting for some viewers , the main message is that a black owned and operated business can thrive through innovation and risk taking . Many people may not take a positive message away from this movie , but I just did . " " Putney Swope " " remains an overlooked movie from a strange era , and Downey , Sr. ( even despite his son 's recent comeback ) never quite got the recognition as a director he deserved . However , if you find a DVD of this movie , buy it and watch it . If it 's on Netflix , ditto . It 's a movie that can be confusing at times , but is worth watching for its gusto , ambition , and its non-conformist stature even by today 's movie standards . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Before I start , I should point out that I know the editor of this film . We 've never met , but we belong to the same fanzine ( those things which came before message boards ) , and we have talked on the phone , so I do have a bias here . Anyway ... Somehow , it 's ironic how while the " " Rat Pack " " culture of the late 50 's and early to mid-60 's made a comeback in the mid-90 's , this movie , from the son of one of the original Rat Pack , and which was made in a similar fashion , was a flop . Not only that , it was a critical flop ; I believe Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not savage this ( he gave it a mixed review , as I recall ) . And while I don 't think this is the greatest film in the world , and I am not a fan of the Rat Pack , or " " cocktail , " " culture , I do think this is worth seeing.For one thing , this looks stylish , and moves right along . For another , the core performances are all good . Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the head gangster coming back from a sanitarium , and has a droll edge to him . Jeff Goldblum goes back to the quietly ironic performances he gave in his pre-blockbuster days , like THE BIG CHILL . And while Ellen Barkin is only required to vamp in this movie , she does it entertainingly . Admittedly , it 's not a great film ; the dialogue is mostly made up of puns , and a lot of them don 't work ( like the whole " " Zen of Ben " " speech ) . And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are awful here . Still , I was entertained , and if you like gangster films , you might be too . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" At least something good came out of Damon Runyon 's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the Mafia . " " Guys and Dolls , " " the seemingly indestructible stage musical , was captured on film in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ( " " All About Eve " " ) in a colorful , enjoyable movie that featured an all-star cast including Vivian Blaine ( from the original Broadway show ) , Jean Simmons ( whose character bears an odd resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in " " Roman Holiday " " ) and two of the all-time great leading men , Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando , both of whom had recently won Oscars for Best Supporting Actor ( " " From Here To Eternity " " ) and Best Actor ( " " On the Waterfront " " ) and were on the top of their game . One listen to Brando singing " " Luck Be a Lady Tonight " " speaks volumes about where the early Dylan got his voice . Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson , who brings down the house with " " Sit Down You 're Rocking The Boat . " " The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds yet another page to his rogue 's gallery of screen gangsters . The film has a bright , cartoonish look , anticipating the Pop Art of the early 1960s . The characters speak in a stylized patois , apparently based on Yiddish idioms . Although the film 's social attitudes and gender roles are dated , it 's all great fun , and even the gentle kidding of the Salvation Army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion . Just seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie , but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie deserves the 10 I 'm giving it.But it 's not the 10 that you 'd give to movies like ' The Godfather ' or ' Goodfellas ' or ' Psycho ' .

Akshay : You are a beautiful woman , and even dead men can get aroused by you ! And these are living young males ! Don 't blame them ! Pancholi : Yeah Manisha .. Manisha ( To Suniel ) : What if they tried to rape your girlfriend ? ? ? Suniel : I 'd break their hands , legs and kill them.But anyways , just forgive them .. Akshay : Yeah if you don 't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty ! Now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue ! This movie never fails to entertain , mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations ! The bad guy ( Munish ) can do basically anything .. He can blow a sandstorm from his mouth , or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again . Every actor takes turns to speak .. One line from Akshay , then from Suniel , then from Arshad , then Aftab , then Nigam . It 's the main rule followed by the director , so that equal screen time is given to each guy . And then there 's the all powerful pendant , which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed !

I particularly enjoyed the performance of Jilon Ghai ( as " " Randy " " ) , who was such a kick in the pants ! His scenes with Charity Rahmer ( " " Michelle " " ) were wildly amusing . I wouldn 't want him coming on to me , but it was great watching " " Randy " " try to score with " " Michelle " " and even better seeing the results ! Of course , the girls in the film are lots of fun to watch too . AND , a friend of mine showed me the PLAYBOY issue that had Pilar Lastra as the Playmate of the Month . She 's definitely a looker . All in all , this film totally served its purpose , which was to entertain us in a light and care-free way . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art , because they are human beings , and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature . That said , the simplistic notion that Ingmar Bergman 's great 1968 film Shame ( or Skammen ) is merely an anti-war film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this very complex , and highly nuanced , film . Compared to its more filmically showoffy predecessors , Persona and Hour Of The Wolf , Shame is seemingly a more classic film , in terms of narrative . But , the key word is seemingly , for while it lacks the bravura pop psychologizing of Persona and the gaudy horror film homages of Hour Of The Wolf , it is one of the best films ever made about war- and not as an anti-war film , nor a pro-war film . As such , it has to rank with Wild Strawberries as one of his greatest films , as well as one of his best screenplays , if not the best.Although ostensibly a more psychologically exterior film than the films that preceded it , it truly says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive . In it , Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman play Jan and Eva Rosenberg ( perhaps a nod at the infamous American spies , whom many European intellectuals felt were innocent ) , two musicians who used to play for the local philharmonic orchestra before a war broke out , and they retreated to live on a small plot of land on an island , content to working in a greenhouse . The country they live in is unnamed , as is the island they live on , although the film was made on Bergman 's small island of Far철 , just off the northern end of the Swedish Island of G철ttland . It seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country , or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another province . This is all left deliberately hazy , as this war is meant to symbolize all wars . This is reinforced as the film starts with assorted war quotes on the screen , as the credits roll . These include quotes from Hitler to Vietnam Era American military figures . After early scenes that depict the prosaic nature of their rural life , and then the coming of war , where even old men are conscripted , an aerial attack ravages the Rosenbergs ' land , as enemy jets fly overhead , dropping bombs and what seems to be chemical weapons of an Agent Orange like nature . One plane is hit , and a parachutist jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree . Jan , who starts off the film as a sniveling coward , refuses to go and help , so Eva goes alone . Jan joins her and they find the pilot has been shot . It seems he is , indeed , part of the invading , or possibly rebel , force . A bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot , then advise the couple to leave their home , as the Invaders are near혚. there are the misinterpretations of the film on a micro level , such as that of Bergman scholar Marc Gervais , who provides the film commentary on the DVD of the film . Like many other critics , he claims that Jacobi is a Quisling , who has collaborated with the Invaders . But , this is clearly and demonstrably wrong , for Jacobi is with the original Fascist government . As proof , first off , the Invaders are repelled after they invade the Rosenbergs ' land and shoot their agitprop interview . We know this because the government that later questions them of the faked interview , and words put into Eva 's mouth , see the film as supposed proof of their treason , and Jacobi is clearly working with them , the Fascist Big Brother statists . Secondly , Jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the townsfolk are sent to concentration camps , for collaborating with the Invaders , and the Rosenbergs , again , are among those spared . Thirdly , in his seduction of Eva , Jacobi tells her his son is on leave from the military , and clearly , if he was an Invader , he would not be speaking so happily of his son serving the state . Also , rebel forces are not official armies , and do not grant official leave . Lastly , Filip is clearly with the rebels , or Invaders , of the Organization , and why would he have killed a colleague ? That Gervais and other critics so blatantly and wantonly misinterpret and flat out miss such a key and manifest point of this film brings into question their ability to discern any and all aspects of all of Bergman 's films . This is a wonderful and great film , and very high in the Berman canon , but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers have really understand its complex message , instead opting out for the cheap , lazy , and easy claim of its being merely anti-war , and a rather simple film in comparison to its two showier predecessors . And that , in the long run , is the real shame of Shame . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Seeing as the vote average was pretty low , and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was " " just OK " , " I didn 't have much expectations when renting this film.But contrary to the above , I enjoyed it a lot . This is a charming movie . It didn 't need to grow on me , I enjoyed it from the beginning . Mel Brooks gives a great performance as the lead character , I think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies.There 's not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that , but there are some rather hilarious scenes , and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film.Very recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original , 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman . That movie - for good reason ! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment . From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out , I believe the impact was something akin to the first " " Starwars " " movie in modern times . I have seen it . It was and is wonderful . But that does not mean that this version is not also worthy . From the first scene the 1973 version grabs you . The noise and tumult are fantastic , especially in they way they prepare you for the peace of Shangri La . And Burt Bacharach 's music is beautiful . So - by all means enjoy the 1937 version . But do not let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let the 1935 King Kong destroy Peter Jackson 's of this year . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" this movie is a very relaxed , romantic-comedy , which is thoroughly enjoyable . Meg Ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of Albert Einstein , though she does believe in her own skills . Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fianc챕 after her car stuffs up . I loved Walter Matthau as the one and only Albert Einstein . This movie just has a very relaxing feel to it , while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it ( if that is actually possible , it happens here ) .I personally found this movie extremely entertaining , especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious ! This movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension . If you have a cheeky sense of humour , this is the movie for you ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have really nothing to add to all the other comments , save this : To me the film looked like a silent film slowly being adapted to sound . The text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression I suppose . Along the way the actors were allowed to leave the stilted , theatre-like acting ; Marguerite Churchill very much looks like a typical early silent movie heroine at the beginning of the film , but at the end is allowed finer expressions . Gus , the Swede ? , reminded me of the comic characters of Shakespeare plays , and Windy sounded to me like an early Donald Duck.It truly amazed me that it was all filmed outdoors , on location , and even though the dust of all the wagons , horses and cattle obscured the view it must actually have been like that for the real settlers ! It also was clear to me that many of those Indians must have been real , and I didn 't detect any overt racism towards them . And John Wayne looks so incredibly young ! As someone who became a real Wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy by John Ford , and thought that Stage Coach was Wayne 's first as a leading star , this film was a revelation . The plot is very simple , again reminding me of a silent film , but the grit is very real indeed ! An amazing film to have been made with that technique and under those conditions in 1930 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's not easy making a movie with 18 different stories in it . Although 18 different international directors took the challenge , not everyone of them is good , some of them even boring . But in his entity , " " Paris , je t 'aime " " is breathtaking , showing that , as " " Love Actually " " put it , ' love is all around ' , especially in the city of love . Here 's a resum챕 ( I 'll try to make at as spoiler-free as possible ) of the 18 different stories.MONTMARTRE - kind of a dull opening sequence , nothing really special about it . A man finds a parking spot , and sees a lot of odd couples walking by , wondering why he can 't find a girl . And than , suddenly , a woman faints next to his car ... QUAIS DE SEINE - another dull sequence , about three teenage boys who are searching for some ' piece of ass ' , when suddenly a Muslim girl trips right in front of them , receiving help from one of the boys . Really basic , but with a sweet heart to it.LES MARAIS - this was a huge disappointment ! Although a love story between two boys with an artsy background could have been interesting by the great Van Sant . Eventually , everything that comes AFTER the monologue by Ulliel is good , everything before it is just annoying.TUILERIES - an entertaining sequence by the Coen brothers . Buscemi - without even saying one word - is mesmerizing and the whole sequence is just hilarious . This one kept me hooked until the very end , and this one also gets you truly hooked to the movie.LOIN DU 16IEME - a beautiful story too , even if the execution is poor , the heart is there . It 's the story of an Hispanic woman who drops her child off , early in the morning , to take care of another suburban baby . Beautiful.PORTE DE CHOISY - this segment has got to be the strangest and weirdest from the whole movie . Some kind of shampoo salesman arrives in a Chinatown-lookalike place in Paris . If I understood it correctly , the story is about inner beauty , but I think I 'm wrong.BASTILLE - a truly wonderful sequence . A man meets with his wife at a restaurant , to break up with her , so that he can run off with his mistress . But the wife has some devastating news . Pretty basic , but truly sad and beautiful ! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - a sad sequence as well . Juliette Binoche plays a grieving mother . One night , she wakes up hearing her dead child . When she arrives at the location , a cowboy tells her she can give one last good-bye to her child . One of the best segments ! TOUR EIFFEL - two mimes who fall in love could have been great , but , even though it has some nice cinematic tricks , the story isn 't intriguing and not funny at all.PARC MONCEAU - a truly original and great sequence , one of the best of the movie ! A young girl and an older man discuss their future and her fear for a certain man ... Cuaron does a great directing job , and the actors are amazing ! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - an American actress ( Gyllenhaal ) falls in love with her drug dealer. a beautiful segment again , with a very sad ending PLACE DES FETES - a woman comes to a homeless man , he starts talking romantic to her ... because she is the love of his life . Beautiful , sad , shocking , romantic , ... Place des F챗tes will make everyone cry.PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins , who are looking for new thrills in their relationship ... very unfunny and unromantic , Pigalle is a let-down.QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - bringing some diversity in the movie , QdlM is a relief . A young guy ( Wood ) finds a vampire killing a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall in love ! Dark , scary and oddly romantic , Madeleine is superb.PERE-LACHAISE - another let-down segment . Directed by Wes Craven and with stars as Mortimer and Sewell , it could have been great , but P챔re-Lachaise is just ordinary , not original at all.FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - the rumors are TRUE , Twyker 's short film is beautiful , stunning and well done . A blind man picks up the phone , and hears from his girlfriend ( Portman - truly stunning ) that she breaks up with him . He reflects on their relationship.QUARTIER Latin - even though this segment has been co-directed by Depardieu and has such stars as Rowlands , Gazzara and Depardieu , this segment is a let-down too . Nothing happens , lack of chemistry between the actors.14TH ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time . An American tells in her French class about her trip to Paris . Her French is truly terrible , but at the end of the segment , she realizes that Paris is so much more than meets the eye.With Feist on the background , " " Paris , je t 'aime " " ends in a sweet tone , not letting me down at all , even though some segments bored the hell out of me , the entity of the movie is great ! A true cinematic experience for young and old . Paris , je t 'aime vraiment ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Rouge " " is part of a trilogy , but very much stands on its own . It isn 't a sequel of any sort . The very end , which I won 't divulge , ties the three films together , but not seeing the other two doesn 't make it too confusing . This film amazes me because it is so spare , so subtle and simple , but is as effective , emotionally and intellectually , as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama . Kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny . Both themes are loosely woven together in the story . The film is very much a puzzle , but the message is pretty straightforward : Everything happens for a reason . Love is in all of our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it . The title , " " Red " " refers to the French flag , where red represents " " fraternity , " " or brotherhood . The color dominates the visuals of the movie . I tend to think of it as representing love or passion , or the blood of life . It 's great when a film allows the freedom to do that ; ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " See No Evil " " was directed by the porno filmmaker Gregory Dark and it stars WWE superstar Kane as remorseless psychopath.The supporting cast is terrible and there are no surprises to be found here , but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy.Overall , I liked this film and you should too , if you are into mindless slasher flicks.Sure , it 's clich챕 , but who cares.7 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This- and not a certain slightly overrated Southern Soap Opera-was the greatest epic to come out of Hollywoods greatest year , 1939.I will not not restate the obvious-Cary Grant , Victor McLaglen ( who WAS a Bengal Lancer ) , and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. give superb comic performances.However , I want to note two other , less understood elements of this masterpiece . The Magnificent final battle sequence , as the wonderful Sam Jaffe climbs laboriously up to the pinnacle of the temple to blow his bugle and warn the regiment , is simply grand . It never fails to enthrall me . Yet another underrated element in the film is Eduardo Ciannelli 's performance as the Guru . This is no Fu Manchu caricature , but an well drawn , articulate , historically informed ( " " Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya ? He defeated the armies left in India by Alexander The Great " " ) villain . Indeed , one can see parallels between this mystical , evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirties ( A German , not an Indian ) . Gunga Din , anti-Nazi tract ? Not quite .

" My brother got me hooked on Carlin back in the 70s . I always loved his observational humor . That is , looking at every day things and finding the humor in it , like asking the question , " " Have you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket ? You can 't do it ! They keep bringing back to you ! " " And asking questions like why is the word kill more acceptable then the " " F " " word , while making prefect sense with the discussion.However , during the 90s his stuff was less funny , and more angry . What he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to society 's face and say ' take a look ! ' At this point , his shows were less of a comedy show , and more of a gripe session . But in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sense . He really made you think.Here was Carlin old and new . He starts out about the fun one could have by getting old , and later slamming the the state of the world . Again making perfect sense.This was his best since " " Jammin ' in New York " , " and as it turns out his last.I think what ' The Shootist ' was to John Wayne , or ' A Prairie Home Companion ' to Robert Altman , ' It 's Bad For Ya ' is to George Carlin . A fond farewell to a true great icon . Love him , or hate him , I think he will be remembered . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It was incredible to find out that the ' Blue planet ' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life !

" In Christian Duguay 's movie , Hitler : The Rise of Evil , Hitler 's early years in life and politics is shown in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration . It is quite natural for a Hollywood movie to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the income that they will get from the movie . Even though such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done by the book , I believe that most of them fits well with the rest of the movie , making it more interesting . We should not forget that this movie is not a documentary . Who cares how did his dog died anyway.Throughout the movie , Hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals . But he was not portrayed as a super-villain but more like an ambitious politician . I believe that this is a nice perspective as the movie is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and this made the movie somewhat objective . Yes he was a little mad , and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in " " Inglorious Bastards " . " I believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts.The flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators . Even though the movie 's focus was around Hitler we also had chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions via newspapers , discussions of people and the songs in a Jewish cabaret . Also society 's reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited . Struggles of journalist Fritz Gerlich and ironic plays that are played in the cabaret was amusing and interesting but that was all . Mostly we only saw his followers rampaging the streets and cheering him.Another thing that was missing in the movie is information about the origins of his hatred for Jews . In the beginning of the movie , some ideas about this is given but they were quite superficial . All of a sudden he was a politician who is giving speeches about necessity of extermination of Jews.In conclusion , Hitler : The Rise of Evil cannot be considered as an excellent movie that everyone will like but it is not unsatisfactory at all . If you can stand directors that change history for cash , it is an interesting movie reflecting Hitler 's personality in a successful way . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed : " " A Scanner Darkly " " and " " Immortel Ad Vitam " . " If you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed ( like me ) , you will probably enjoy Renaissance . It immerses you into the world of a future Paris . It is not quite dystopian . They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotoscoped , but from what I can tell , it was not , it was merely motion capture . The facial expressions are amazing ! Not since TRON have I seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation / live hybrid . The Black and White medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene ; my favorite effect was what they did with headlight beams , watch for it . The director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find . The overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises.The plot is secondary , but it isn 't terrible . It is noir-ish . There is a backstory for most of the major characters giving them some depth . There is weather . There are " " sets " " so you can feel like you are in different places in Paris . There is some action , and even a car chase . I am going to have to see this one again to get everything . I also recommend a very large screen to view it as the " " sets " " are detailed and the credits are small . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was surfing through IMDb one day , when I stumbled across " " The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird . " " Noticing how obscure it was , I decided to set off looking for it . Thanks to Digiview , it didn 't take me long , so I bought it for a dollar , and when I got home , I watched it , although I must say , I was quite impressed.Three of the paintings in a king 's apartment , a shepherdess , a chimney sweep , and a self-portrait of the king ( who is just as selfish and sadistic as the actual king himself ) come to life one night while the king is sleeping . The shepherdess and the chimney sweep escape , while the painting of the king calls the police in order to capture the couple . Fortunately for the couple , Mr. Wonderbird comes in to help them , often mocking the police and the king.The back of the DVD case describes this film as " " a surreal visual delight and an underrated entry in the history of classic animation . " " I couldn 't agree more with it , considering that much of the backgrounds look rather bizarre , and many of the characters are weird , which include the depressed citizens of an underground city and hungry lions that are calmed by the music of a blind man ( who kind of looks like Andy Warhol ) , not to mention Mr. Wonderbird himself is somewhat eccentric . The film is very creative and mostly fun to watch , and its only flaw is that it can be slow moving . But overall , this film was very good , and it comes recommended by yours truly.Grade : B + ( Awesome ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage . The main thrust of the narrative arises from a ' homily ' spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan . In it , the future course of the marriage is spelled out , which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life . The ' moral ' of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out , both now , and in the past , it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends . This film was a relative blockbuster by domestic Italian standards . It 's a terrible shame that this film is not available in either DVD or VHS . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As the superb ' Prime Suspect ' series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all , this in itself a considerable achievement . ' Prime Suspect IV : The Lost Child ' has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these British dramas but of course the beautiful Helen Mirren easily dominates ; our eyes never leave her while she 's on-screen.The search for the lost child of the title leads Superintendent Jane Tennison 's CID team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters . The insight we are given into the workings of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series but it may be too strong for many stomachs.The action sequences are brilliantly handled with the hand-held camera thrusting us right into the middle of the excitement and there 's gripping tension during the climactic siege.Altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ( Review is of the original 1950 's version not the restored 1980 's one ) In a land where the king likes no one and no one likes the king a shepherdess and a chimney sweep from two nearby paintings come to life and run off . A portrait of the king , who loves the shepherdess , kills the real king and takes his place . A huge bird , the wonderbird of the title , acts as a hero of sorts and helps out our two lovers.This is a strange strange movie ... no surreal , very very very surreal.The style of the background is very European while the characters are Fliescher meet Warner but early arty Warner of the non major characters . They move in both realistic and cartoon like manners.This is an odd movie and it takes a bit to get into it but Peter Ustinov as the bird is a riot , his kids and the puppy are wonderful . There are cops in rubber ducks and a bear design that makes you smile.And there is deep philosophy in the film , about the existence of a world out there ... out beyond a Metropolis subterranean city.This is a really neat movie . There is something just so odd and unique about it that rewards you if you stay with it for the whole ride . Its not perfect but what the hell.This is a movie to search out . If your local bargain DVD bin has the capcom version ( paired with Alice in Paris ) buy it . It should run you under ten bucks , probably around five and the price is absolutely worth it especially when you realize it comes with two full length cartoons , two short cartoons and several neat commercials and other fun things . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I love a film that mixes edge-of-the-seat suspense , laughs , style , good acting , and a bit of self-parody . Hitchcock consistently carried this off , and in " " Le Cercle rouge " " Jean-Pierre Melville does the same . I was sorry when this long film ended . I agree with the English commenter who found remarks by one of my compatriots chauvinistic . I love French films , Italian films , English films , Indian films--and the increasingly rare good American films . I also feel the writer who panned the film for being not even a good copy of an American gangster film , missed the point completely .

" The director , Ramin Niami , delivers the goods with Somewhere in the City . This hilarious farce , I believe , is in the tradition of a Mel Brooks comedy . Niami pokes fun at New York society by creating the believable , eccentric , and tragic characters of one tenement apartment building bringing them to life from the very opening one shots that introduce them . Peter Stormare 's performance as a gay Shakespearean actor is absolutely award worthy and the film in general does a good job at showing the hopelessness and laugh-ability of self-centered ambition . Sandra Bernhard is cast perfectly as the straight , self-obsessed therapist . I really enjoyed Sandra 's performance immensely especially since I haven 't really been a very big fan until now . Bai Ling , Ornella Muti , and Bulle Ogier round out an international ensemble par excellence . I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of idiot criminals who couldn 't plan a robbery if their lives depended on it .

" This movie surprised me . The box is misleading , the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading . The movie is quite gory , well-acted and beautifully shot . The special-effects are top-notch and seem to be ahead of their time , until you realize this movie came out in 1979 , not in 1963 like it 's tone would suggest . It is a unique take on the Dr. Moreau story , and one of the better versions filmed . The first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking , but the film doesn 't ever really fall apart . Definitely worth-seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume / horror classics and gore-fests . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
... " but the general moviegoer 's mileage may vary in Mary " " American Psycho " " Harron 's stylized look at the American sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal Queen of Curves , Bettie Page.I 'll not bore anyone with a recitation of the iconic status of Ms. Page , a prim and proper valedictorian from Nashville , Tennessee , who moved to New York in hopes of being an actress and ended up becoming the Bondage Queen of the Universe . Nor will I run through the sketchy bio-pic plot of " " The Notorious Bettie Page , " " though I offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film ( a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind ) , improper use of a period camera notwithstanding . Finally , I won 't belabor the timely applicability of the film 's themes of innocence and perversion , freedom and control , the sacred and the secular ; they 're there for the viewer to absorb , if they wish . The more things change , the more they stay the same , as the saying goes.What I will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page . Truth is , Mol 's face looks almost nothing like Bettie 's , nor is she particularly built like Bettie ( although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts , and no fool , I ! ) . She doesn 't even sport the thick , dark bush that concealed Ms. Page 's most intimate charms , but the fact remains that Mol thoroughly embodies the spirit of Bettie Page in every way , shape , and form . It is a bravura " " comeback " " from an undeserved semi-obscurity . I 've never met Ms. Page ( and sadly , never will , most likely ) , but I 've devoured the photos and videos , and read all the bios and interviews available , bought the trading cards and other odds and ends , and to be honest , lusted for Ms. Page ever since I first discovered her in my adolescence between the covers of dusty tease magazines at the barber shop and the five and dime . Mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as I have come to conceive her , no pun intended , in what I consider to be an Oscar-worthy performance . Liv Tyler could never have matched Mol 's shining intensity of characterization in a million years , and I , for one , am grateful she left the project . Not that I 'd mind seeing her totally naked , I hasten to add , but I can 't imagine that her brand of sensuality would have translated into the innocent exhuberance of Bettie Page . " " The Notorious Bettie Page " " is not for everyone , any more than bondage and discipline are . I suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters ; legions of devoted Page fans and the curious will see to that . I can only hope that the DVD will be chock full of enough Bettie extras to show the uninitiated just how good a job Mol has done.Beyond that , a tip of the hat to a fine supporting cast , especially Lili Taylor and Chris Bauer as Paula and Irving Klaw , whose celebrity photo business was Bettie 's doorway to immortality.A final note to the young scribe who opined that Ms. Page had no effect on his generation : take a good look at Madonna 's cone brassiere and get back to us . Bettie Page is , whether you know it or not , the true Godmother of fetishwear . Without her , Madonna and the rest of her kin could never have existed . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A Matter of Life and Death , what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film . Powell and Pressburger 's visual imagination knows no bounds , every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions . The switches between the bold colours of " " the real world " " to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious , showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is . The final court scene is also fantastic , as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over Peter ( David Niven ) ' s operation . All of the performances are spot on ( Roger Livesey being a standout ) , and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful , never has there been a more romantic film than this ( if there has I haven 't seen it ) . A Matter of Life and Death is all about the power of love and just how important life is . And Jack Cardiff 's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone , the way he lights Kim Hunter 's face makes her all the more beautiful , what a genius , he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting . And the sound design is also impeccable ; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its timeThis is a true classic that can restore anyone 's faith in cinema , under appreciated on its initial release and by today 's audiences , but one of my all time favourites , which is why I give this film a 10 / 10 , in a word - Beautiful . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I loved the movie , but like everyone said , there were some bits that weren 't developed enough . I thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison ; sure , they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still ... I felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have . For example , in the montage where they 're sight-seeing , the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-looking.Then , there are some parts that were very ambiguous . I think it 's pretty much understood that Danes ' character didn 't do it , but I can see how that could be confusing . Also , why did the camera dwell on Manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk ? I thought it was suggesting something , but it turned out to be nothing.Apart from that , the movie was great . I cried when Claire Danes took the blame ; she 's a GREAT actress.Also , I wanted to see that bitchy Thai inmate get her ass kicked . Talk about lack of closure ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Rita Hayworth lights up the screen in this fun , fancy and delightful musical starring Gene Kelly . Rita plays nightclub dancer Rusty Parker who has dreams to be a successful Broadway star . Unfortunately , her career is getting no where in Danny McGuire 's Night Club . When one of her fellow dancers says she 's going to enter a Cover Girl contest , she decides to follow her dreams and enters . She reminds the publisher of her Grandma , who he was deeply in love with many years ago . But when she finds this success , her boyfriend is not happy about it.I had never seen Rita before this , and I am so glad I did ! She has such a scene presence and is a very good actress . There are some good numbers in here , not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to . One thing I didn 't like was Gene Kelly 's character . He should have supported his girlfriend ! But anyway , that 's perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie . Cover Girl is a glorious , fluffy film - perfect escapism . Not everyone 's ideal movie , but a wonderful movie nonetheless , due to Rita Hayworth 's star power . Great movie , truly impressed . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in N체rnberg , and it was superb . I do have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion / xylophone player influenced the mood of the film , but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic Nibelungen saga.If you are interested in silent films or in the Nibelungenlied , I highly recommend this film . The costumes were fantastic and creative , the sets were opulent and exotic , and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking ( as is typical of silent film " " tragedies " " ) Unfortunately , I have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns Siegfried . The story of this second film begins after Siegfried 's death , when Kremhild ( Gudrun in the Norse versions of the story ) begins to plan her revenge against her brothers.Also , I watched this film in German ; I am a native English speaker and have a basic German knowledge . It was difficult to read the ? subtitles ( what do you call that in silent films ? ) at first because of the old style German script , so I advise that if you watch it in German that you make sure you can differentiate your " " k 's " , " " " f 's " , " and " " s 's " " in the old script . : ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Although I 've long been a fan of Peter Weir , I hadn 't watched any of his Australian movies until I watched The Last Wave . And it was a pleasant , unpredictable surprise.Richard Chamberlain plays David , a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another Aborigine . For David 's peers it 's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence . But David believes there 's a mystery underneath the murder , linked to tribal rituals . As his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself too.To reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies I 've ever seen . I can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting.There are many elements that make this a fascinating movie : Chamberlain 's acting , for instance ; but also the performances by David Gulpilil , who plays a young aborigine who introduces David into tribal mysteries ; and Nandjiwarra Amagula , who plays an old aborigine who 's a spiritual guide . The relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie.But there 's also the way Weir suggests the supernatural in the movie . David has dreams that warn him of the future . Australia is undergoing awful weather , with storms , hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution . But it 's also related to the case David is defending . How it 's related is one of the great revelations of the movie . Out of little events Weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression , suggesting future horrors without really showing anything.Charles Wain 's score is fantastic , especially the use of the didgeridoo . The photography is also quite good . Russell Boyd , Weir 's longtime DP who won an Oscar in 2004 for Master and Commander , depicts a dark , creepy world full of mystery.I also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines , it doesn 't turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions , like Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai . This movie is too clever to be that simplistic.Sometimes it can be frustrating , and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense ; but for those who don 't mind some strangeness or ambiguity , The Last Wave is a great movie to watch . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sandra Bernhard is quite a character , and certainly one of the funniest women on earth . She began as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s , but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese 's underrated masterpiece , " " The King of Comedy " . " Her film career never quite took off , though . She did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures , such as " " Dallas Doll " " ( 1994 ) or " " Dinner Rush " " ( 2000 ) , but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself . " " Without You I 'm Nothing " " is undoubtedly her best effort . It 's an adaptation of her smash-hit off-Broadway show which made her a superstar 혯 and Madonna 's best friend for about four years . In ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes , Sandra turns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross , talks about her childhood , Andy Warhol and San Francisco and performs songs made famous by Burt Bacharach , Prince , or Sylvester . Director John Boskovich got Sandra to do a 90-minute tour-de-force performance that 's both sexy and uniquely funny . If you are a Bernhard fan , you can 't miss out this film ; it 's a tribute as well to her ( weird ) beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne . And it has influenced filmmakers in their work 혯 " " Hedwig and the Angry Inch " , " for instance , would look a lot different if " " Without You I 'm Nothing " " didn 't exist . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I doubt if the real story of the development of Western Union would ever have gained a real audience . Instead of talking about the building of the telegraph system out west , it was the story of board rooms , dominated by one of the most interesting ( and disliked ) of the great " " Robber Barons " " : Jay Gould . Gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant - and part of his attempt at a national railway system to rival Vanderbilt 's . But this , while interesting , is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the telegraph lines themselves . At least , that is how audiences would see it . Jay Gould died in 1892 . Had he lived into the modern era , and invested in Hollywood , he probably would have agreed to that assessment too.The film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is endangered by Indians , spurred on by one Jack Slade ( Barton MacLane ) . Slade , a desperado , is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a crimp in his abilities to evade the police in the territories . He is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the telegraph wires , Edward Creighton ( Dean Jagger ) , Creighton 's associate Richard Blake ( Robert Young ) , and a quasi-lawman Vance Shaw ( Randolph Scott ) , who is Slade 's brother . Blake , an Easterner with little understanding of the West , is romancing Creighton 's sister Sue ( Virginia Gilmore ) , but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings . But he does become a close friend of Shaw , especially in trying to confront Slade.Slade was a real Western criminal , by the way , and the subject of a section of Mark Twain 's ROUGHING IT . He was hanged in the 1870s . But he did not have any involvement in stirring up Indians against railroads or telegraph companies . However , MacLane makes him a memorably evil , and totally vicious type . His killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind - and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance . But Lang is responsible for that , as well as other touches . Look at the sequence with Chill Wills , where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it . He spits tobacco juice several times while talking to Young , who gets a little splattered . Then there is an Indian attack which we watch from the ground level . At the conclusion , Young suddenly gets splattered again , but it 's not brown but red that covers him . He looks up at the pole 's top , and there is Wills with an Indian arrow through him.It is an exciting film to watch , and well worth catching . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Anastasia : The Mystery of Anna was a two-part star studded historical T.V. movie based on the Peter Kurth book , Anastasia : The Riddle of Anna Anderson . It keeps up historically pretty much , names are changed etc . But sticks to the real story quite well . Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom do quite well as the Russian royals , Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra . What stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland . All in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting . I was quite awestruck by the production values when it first aired on NBC in late 1986 . Also starring was the fine German actor Jan Niklas who had previously starred in NBC 's other Russian epic " " Peter the Great " . " I felt that Part 2 skipped over some important details of Anna Anderson 's trip to America . It 's important to know too , that in 1986 less was known about the Anna Anderson story . Back then it was still not known whether her claim to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine . By the late 1990 's more was known and Anna Anderson is now reputed to have been a fraud . Too bad the networks aren 't making fine made-for-television movies like this anymore . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Henry Thomas , and Robin Tunny , are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business . It 's beyond me as to why they haven 't received more recognition than they have . This movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities are.Acting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality , and if these characters ain 't odd , I 'm at a loss to find anyone who is.The story is funny , romantic , dramatic , complicated , and tragic . I hated the ending , but if I hadn 't , I wouldn 't have loved the story as a whole . So there ya go . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A year after her triumphant first special , " " My Name Is Barbra " , " Barbra Streisand regrouped with her production team to produce this follow-up CBS-TV special in then-revolutionary color . First broadcast in March 1966 , " " Color Me Barbra " " follows a similar format to its predecessor - three segments , the first two with unique concepts . The first takes place in the after-hours halls of the Philadelphia Museum of Art where dressed as a period maid , she roams the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through song . In various guises , Streisand expresses a variety of moods from the comedy schtick of the " " Minute Waltz " " to the melodrama of " " Non C 'est Rien " " in a Modigliani painting to the beatnik-style frenzy of " " Gotta Move " " set to abstract art . My favorite moment in the special is when she transforms into a dead ringer of Queen Nefertiti while singing a haunting rendition of Rogers and Hart 's " " Where or When " . " Opening with another comic monologue full of silly non-sequiturs , this time in French , the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly-colored circus medley where she interacts with animals , including her beloved poodle Sadie . She finds an appropriate context for " " Sam , You Made the Pants Too Long " " with a bevy of penguins and comically compares her profile to an anteater 's with " " We Have So Much in Common " . " As with the first special , the program ends with a riveting solo concert in which she sings some chestnuts , " " Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home " , " " " Where Am I Going ? " " and " " Starting Here , Starting Now " " among them . Also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986 , ironically dressed in all-white , when the special was first released on VHS . The juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than in her first special , and a 23-year old Streisand is in peak form . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Oh dear . Yet another example of " " Oireland " " and religion . No doubt we 'll be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some " " hunky and macho freedom fighters " " from the IRA . Well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later I was in a state of shock . What a superb movie The story starts on the day of the wedding between Sean Cloney and Sheila Kelly in the 1950s . There is a slight problem since they 're getting married in the catholic church and that is Sheila is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen Sheila takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when they 're old enough . The story - Which is set in the 1950s - then jumps forward a few years when the Cloney daughters are about to start school but Sheila has decided they 'll be attending the local protestant school much to the disgust of local priest Father Stafford . From there things escalate Let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both Irish catholic and Scottish protestant heritage I was brought up as agnostic and have considered myself as an atheist throughout my adult life . In fact when it comes to religion I consider myself a Marxist and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people . A LOVE DIVIDED shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe . May I have the temerity to state that if Karl Marx saw this movie he 'd love it and call it a masterpiece ? Perhaps I shouldn 't since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you In reply to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort I don 't claim to know the exact details of what happened in County Wexford and there 's no denying that Father Stafford and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but Sheila isn 't blameless herself . Think about a woman living in a rural village in 1950s Ireland who takes a pledge to bring her children up as catholics then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this ? This is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them . Not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their shattered lives . There 's also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former IRA man Andy Bailey who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former IRA member ( That makes a change . We 're not talking about THE DEVIL 'S OWN here ) but simply because he is an atheist who has decided to think for himself A LOVE DIVIDED is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself , all of which I agree with . If there 's any sort of criticism it 's that it feels too much like a TVM rather than a cinematic movie but believe me I can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the opium of the masses , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Ice Age " " is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the company 's first . We are introduced to the main characters : a squirrel named Scrat ( voiced by Chris Wedge , AND PLEASE NOTE : the sound of Scrat 's screams is the sound of Tom 's screams from the " " Tom and Jerry " " cartoons ) , a woolly mammoth named Manny ( voiced by Ray Romano of " " Everybody Loves Raymond " " ) , a sloth named Sid ( voiced by John Leguizamo of " " Titan A. E. " " ) , and a saber toothed tiger named Diego ( voiced by Denis Leary of Pixar 's " " A Bug 's Life " " ) .The movie opens with Scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that , he caused an avalanche . We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age ( except for Manny , who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him ) . Sid comes out of his cave yawning , and saw that his family abandoned him . He then pays toll with some aardvarks . Unfortunately , he gets pursued by Sylvia ( voiced by Kirsten Johnston of " " 3rd Rock from the Sun " " ) , a female orange sloth , who wants Sid to go migrating with her . Sid eventually teams up with Manny , and they became friends.Meanwhile , nearby a human tribe , Soto ( voiced by Goran Visnjic ) , an evil saber toothed tiger , wants revenge against the tribe 's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son , Roshan , away from him . In the morning , he , Diego , and Soto 's henchmen , Lenny ( voiced by Alan Tudyk ) , Oscar ( voiced by Diedrich Bader ) , and Zeke ( voiced by Jack Black ) attacked the tribe , but the leader 's wife escaped with Roshan and gave him to Manny and Sid to look after . Eventually , Diego joins them , and went on a journey to return Roshan back to his tribe , who are also looking for him as well . Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out , okay ? Besides Manny , Sid , Diego , Scrat , Sylvia , and Roshan , the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that Roshan 's tribe are using , and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named Jennifer ( voiced by Jane Krakowski ) , and a skinny female yellow sloth named Rachel ( voiced by Lorri Bagley ) , to whom Sid shows them Roshan as they relax in a tar pit . Incidentally , the two rhinos , Carl ( voiced by Cedric The Entertainer of PDI 's " " Madagascar " " ) , and Frank ( voiced by Stephen Root of Pixar 's " " Finding Nemo " " ) , who go after Sid for ruining their meal and confront Manny on a cliff , are simple minor characters . Same went for the dodos , who are using melons as their food supply.The gags in this movie are very funny . For instance , Manny talks through his trunk saying , " " I 'M NOT GOING ! " " When Jennifer and Rachel are out of the tar pit , Sid asks Jennifer " " What do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens ? " " Jennifer then responds to him , " " What do you say if you go jump into the TAR PIT ! ? " " Rachel also then kicks Sid in the waist . Sylvia sees Diego holding Sid by the neck with his teeth , then she asks Sid if he 's holding his breath , tells Diego to eat him , and promptly walks off.Since " " Ice Age " " is not only a success , but it has 2 sequels : the first one was " " Ice Age : The Meltdown " , " which was released in 2006 , and the other was " " Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs " , " which is going to be releasing next year .

" This program would be useful for training hardened felons basic human emotions . Beyond this purpose , the show has no value other than to fill bandwidth that would otherwise go unutilized in the electromagnetic spectrum . I feel a greater sense of suspense and anticipation listening to a computerized voice chip endlessly droning out the products of a random number generator . Fortunately , the helpful and frequent music cues will tell viewers how they 're supposed to feel , in case they are unable to fully internalize the predictable and shallow plot line . I did find Amy to be a superficially positive character , as she is a role model to young women that they can serve in traditionally male fields . Unfortunately , her totally subjective approach to the law is guided solely by whatever capricious personal guidelines Amy elects to employ , resulting in Amy 's trials more closely resembling appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than a true administration of justice . This show is unpalatable in any amount , although this is to some extent mitigated after two episodes by the brain 's god-given filtering processes , by which the show will thankfully leave the same imprint on the viewer 's memory as a television tuned to a dead channel at maximum volume . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First of all I saw this movie without knowing anything about it I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me . A friend and I went to see it at a Danish film festival called the night-film festival which is a lot of different movies shown after hours the festival pretty much specializes in showing movies that wouldn 't otherwise be shown in Danish theaters.Anyway My friend and I went to see it and we were astonished at how real it seemed and that it really struck a cord with our feelings , we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out the ending which is a great plus in our book.The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish initiative " " dogma 95 " " which was started by 4 Danish directors including Lars Von Trier ( Dancer In the Dark ) .In conclusion the movie is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the American G.I. Joe coming out of school being expected to serve their country in battle a long way from home.Also Colin Farrell is exceptional in this movie I haven 't seen him before but I can 't wait to see more of him.Lars P.

" I feel very strongly that this film was just like Waiting to Exhale with white females in the 1950 's . As in Waiting to Exhale , all of the female characters got mixed up with men who were either married or no good . The only difference , besides the obvious , was that there wasn 't much humor in this film . I would even say that it was tragic . Only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere ( Hope Lange 's guy ) , but even then there was conflict in this relationship.The story was about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had hopes and dreams of success . Unfortunately for them , romance didn 't seem to come easy although they were young , intelligent and attractive . This movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving Suzy Parker 's character whose obsession of an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy.This is a must see . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe " " How to lose friends & alienate people " . " The underlying romance in the plot is , for the most part , displaced by a far more interesting " " rags to riches " " tale . Although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed , in several screen shots , it does have a sense of ; getting the " " nitty gritty " " out of the way , focusing on those key relationships which make " " office politics " " and using those almost irrelevant scenes , used purely for comic effect . Yet it works so well , especially with Pegg in the front seat . The film is ultimately very clever , playing well on the trans-Atlantic relationship Pegg shares with his co-stars and merging the cross between the high and low -life society quite well and quite refreshingly in a storyline that despite predictability is somewhat of a unique journey . The different characters in the film are presented well and casting is definitely a plus point on the film . Both the " " trading places " " relationship between Pegg and Huston and the " " love , hate " " relationship between Pegg and Dunst do work so well in a story that is , for want of a better word , charming . Even Fox , whose main asset is of course sex appeal , shocks with what turns out to be quite a dark character and acts that " " bimbo " " role all to well . Its one of these films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work . From transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack it all meshes nicely into what can only be described as clever comedy . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Irrespective of the accuracy of facts , Bandit Queen is a true story , its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in 1994 . This movie is violent , powerful and thought provoking.The protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood , whose adversity brought out the best ( or worst ) out of her . Keeping the subjectivity aside , there is no doubt that Phoolan 's character from a young girl of 8 , who is married off by her father to clear a debt ( pun intended ) , to a gang leader who goes on to become a leader of the lower caste , has evolved into a champion in her own right . Her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre.I can understand if the western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece , Bandit Queen needs to be ' studied ' in the Indian context , and not just checked out in stereotypes . I may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal but its certainly a must watch for the Indian audience , its a shame that the movie had a delayed , overtly censored release in India.Bandit Queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in India , being a woman and that too a lower caste , her rebellious nature and inability to just give in caused her the most horrible experiences in life , which only went on to strengthen her into a self proclaimed goddess . She responded to violence with violence and dint become the submissive woman society wanted her to be . Call it divine justice or judiciary failure , had she killed a single person she would have been hanged , she killed 24 and got revered , respected and glorified.P.S # Whoever found her character " " psychotic " , " needs to be sodomized at 8 , gangraped by 10 men at a go and paraded naked . Then they should be asked- How normal do they feel ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The consequences of love : There is really something special about this film but it 's very hard to put your finger on . It is a love story of sorts but not really one i 've seen before . It has several love themes running throughout the film . One mans love for a younger woman , a younger mans love for his older brother , the mafias love of money at all costs these are just some that intertwine in a story that has you guessing or rather not knowing where and how it will end . The cast are all superb from Sophia the teasing barmaid to the straight faced-ness of titta the films central character . With simple yet affective camera work bounced off an ever-changing soundtrack that mixes low-fi trip hop with lush orchestral pieces .

" Where the Sidewalk Ends ( 1950 ) ' opens , appropriately , with Dana Andrews ' and Gene Tierneys ' names inscribed on the sidewalk , as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate . The sidewalk represents respectability , integrity and morality 혯 only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter . But even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion , and , when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end , sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting one 's shoes wet . Mark Dixon ( Dana Andrews ) was born in the gutter , his father a professional criminal , and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk , perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb . As a police detective , Dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked , but he possesses a mean-streak that he can 't escape . When his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead , Dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised , a cheap criminal who 'll cheat and lie to cover up his offence . ' Where the Sidewalk Ends ' was the only film to reunite Dana Andrews , Gene Tierney and director Otto Preminger after the superb ' Laura ( 1944 ) , ' though the two films , as far as noir goes , couldn 't be further apart . Whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a country-house murder tale , this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama . Given her ravishingly memorable performance as Laura Hunt , it 's unfortunate that here Tierney is grossly underused , occupying the typical niche of the pretty , helpless romantic interest { much as she did that same year in Jules Dassin 's ' The Night and the City ( 1950 ) ' } . Andrews , on the other hand , has rarely been better , exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that I hadn 't expected of him . Gary Merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss Scalise , but he doesn 't seem mean enough for the role , and I think that an actor like Richard Conte ( who played Mr. Brown in ' The Big Combo ( 1955 ) ' ) would have better suited the character ; I hadn 't realised this , but Conte appeared just one year earlier in Preminger 's ' Whirlpool ( 1949 ) . ' The tension , as Dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime , is absolutely riveting 혯 certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era 혯 though I feel that the situation still wasn 't exploited to its full potential . The taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified Dixon as the perpetrator , but Preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes Dixon on the stairs . Had the witness been brought in as Dixon was re-enacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance , we could have had some genuine fireworks . And why , for that matter , couldn 't the taxi driver 's testimony have immediately absolved Jiggs Taylor ( Tom Tully ) from suspicion of murder ? Niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from Ben Hecht , who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hard-hitting cops and wise-cracking felons .

" Things I like . Steve Zahn as Gus , nails the part , copies Robert Duvalls mannerisms which makes him feel comfortable to Gus fans . ( some of the other actors copy their predecessors style in this series as well ) . Karl Urban , looks grim and tough , but can crack a joke and smile too , which T.L.Jones did in original series . The gear , the guns , the clothing , all accurate , or very close to period accurate . I 'll never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon lariat in their chuckwagon in Open Range . The Comanches , they are actually riding bareback , rather than hiding a modern saddle under a Navajo blanket . And they aren 't painted as politically correct peace loving pastoralists , but as a proud warrior people . There are some dumb scenes , but it beats the heck out of yet another variation on doing something stupid to not win a million dollars reality game shows . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In the early 19th century , a young woman with a harelip falls foul of her family 's ambition and the superstitions of the local community , but she meets a man who may see her differently , and just may , change Pru 's life forever.Precious Bane is a British Broadcasting Corporation adaptation of the highly acclaimed novel by Mary Webb . It 's a beautifully filmed piece that is acted to an incredibly high standard , the story { screenplay by Maggie Wadey } is excellent , and the period detail and use of dialect is second to none . It 's such a shame that this film has yet to get a DVD release , one would have thought that with Clive Owen 's { great here as Gideon } rise to stardom , the BBC would get it out there , but sadly no , so the only way of catching it is on the very rare occasions that TCM shows it . The lead performance from Janet McTeer as Pru Sarn is simply brilliant , guts and genuine emotion go hand in hand as McTeer gives it her all . Pru has to not only contend with her facial disfigurement , but also the constant snides and hurt from the ignorant villagers . This is a time when folk believed that if a Hare ran in front of a pregnant woman it spelt doom , a time of Bull Baiting , a time of superstitions and talk of witches . In spite of constant set backs Pru is strong and resourceful , even her own family knock her dreams back without realising it , but this road may well be a terribly bumpy one , but hope is everlasting , and Pru has hope in abundance.8.5 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one movie that will take time to get out of your head once you have seen it . The dialogs are close to perfect , which was to be expected as it has been adapted from a play . The actors are simply giving their best , the story is simple and attractive . 88 minutes of pure bliss ! Yvan Attal is totally credible in his role , Sandrine Kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde ( but not so dumb ) providing as much pleasure to the eyes as to the ears , Jean-Paul Rouve is providing an excellent approximation of the total jerk ( and proud to be such ) , and Marina Fois is the dumb friend who is always blundering when you expect it least.Thumbs up to Bernard Rapp and associates for adapting this excellent play , and all the best for future productions ! I wish there were more of these in nowadays production . If you liked it , you will also probably enjoy : " " Un air de famille " , " and " " Cuisine et dependances " .

" A stunning film which brought into the open so much about disability that generally makes people afraid . It showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled individual.Love , friendship , fear , frustration , joy , humour and so many others things were so well captured . The 2 lead characters were very well played by the 2 able bodied actors and invited your laughter , tears , concern , joy and dismay.I approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation worrying that it might be too much a play for sympathy or dwell only on negatives . It was however a beautifully crafted story of 2 friends.I loved it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I found this movie to be filled with irony . But watching the movie you can almost for see what will happen . Leila is a confused , bored house wife , who is constantly looking for happiness . When she thinks she finds true happiness , she clings onto it , leaving behind all that she knew . But she finds her self almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband . She learned that if she only had communicated more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage , that it could have been salvaged a lot easier that she intended it to be . She realizes that words are nothing with out action , but she learns that too far into her second marriage and finds herself looking back and hoping for change once again . The main conflict in this movie , is Leila vs herself . You can not have true happiness with out yourself being truly happy . I liked this movie , but I would only recommend this movie to women , I can 't see a man truly finding enjoyment in this movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I went to see this movie at a book signing in Lexington , Ky last night . After a wonderful night that consisted of a few brief words with Mr. Bruce Campbell ( you have to say it all , not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell ; D ) , friends while the books were being signed , and a QnA session with our favorite deadite killer the lights dimmed.So as not to spoil anything , I wont go into detail ... but I loved the movie ! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job keeping the classic b-movie feel . The characters were classic ' b ' characters , the place was refreshing ( what movies do * you * know of that are based in Bulgaria ? ) and the setting was both near-original and fun ! On top of that the humor that is portioned throughout the movie that kept the audience laughing through much of the movie.While this movie dosen 't have as great of a general appeal to people as some , it is a beacon of fun and laughter in a season of ( as Mr. Bruce Campbell put it ) ' b-movies ' that are listed as ' a-movies ' ( Bewitched , Dukes of Hazard , Charlie and the Chocolate factory ?

" Okay , this wasn 't the greatest horror movie I 've ever seen in my life . Despite the fact that it 's lower budget , it 's a pretty decent movie , though . The monsters are unique and believable . Heck , they 're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family . Although , when you finally do get to see the monsters completely , you really think " " WTF ! ? those itty bitty things are after them ? ! " " The only part that really disturbed me is when * sniff * they killed the kitty ! Not the kitty , noooooo , why ? Seriously though , if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore , this is not the movie for you . Go rent The Hills Have Eyes or something along those lines . If you have small children , I wouldn 't recommend watching this with them though ; probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I for one really like this movie for some reasons I 'll go into late but I want to touch on why I think people don 't like it . First off , there are people out there who just like to hate Tom Cruise . I don 't understand it really . Second , Cameron Crowe I think successfully p * * * es off two groups of movie-goers with this film . The casual , relaxed , " " not looking to think too hard " " group of movie-goers are left confused when the plot takes a complete 180 at the end of the movie . And the deep , philosophical , mystery-fans are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters completely explain the mystery.This is a good movie . And Tom Cruise does a very good job in it . I think it 's probably his best performance from what I 've seen all though I haven 't seen all of his movies , or even a majority of them probably . The supporting cast is good as well . Penelope Cruz gives a solid performance and Jason Lee was enjoyable.I like the story , and I think that 's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything . It 's a mystery , an adventure , and a romantic comedy , but it 's mostly just a good story . And it has a lot of philosophical undertones to it , and many similar ideas and stories like this occur in historical philosophy . David Aames ( Cruise ) is the man that had everything he wanted , more or less lost it , was given a second chance with a catch to regain it all back , and in the end facing his demons and the full scope of what is happening , chooses reality , simplicity , and normality to see if he can finally find the one thing he could never get a grip on : happiness.Many people were disappointed that Crowe laid out the complete mystery at the end . I think it 's necessary . The audience then knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that David is aware of his circumstances and it makes the choice at the end all the more powerful.And the music in the movie is great . It 's probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is . Particularly , " " Njosnavelin " " by Sigur Ros , which is an amazing song.All in all , I 'd give it 3 out 4 stars . It 's a movie with some substance for those who like to think things through , and a great story for those looking to relax . That " " moderate " " approach is probably why people dislike it so much because it isn 't a full blown mystery , or a full blown love story . It mixes and matches different elements and genres . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in New York in the 1960s ( the origins of Off Off Broadway ) . Though it 's not for everyone , it is a genuinely brilliant , darkly funny , even more often deeply disturbing tale about love , sex , personal liberty , and revenge , a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when Congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our Constitution . The story is not about being gay , though -- it 's about love and sex that don 't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate . On the surface , it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig , but like any great fable , it 's not really about animals , it 's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in America.The stage version won international acclaim in its original production , it toured the U.S. and Europe , and with others of its kind , influenced almost all theatre that came after it . Luckily , we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived , with the original cast and original director , Tom O 'Horgan ( who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway ) .This is not a mainstream , easy-to-take , studio film -- this is an aggressive , unsettling , glorious , deeply emotional , wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you 'll never forget . And it just might change the way you see the world ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie started off well enough , sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch . The soundtrack was torturously bad . Saxaphone and electric guitars ? It was gratingly incongruous . The female singer was positively dreary ! In the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn . Too dark for Austen . Northanger Abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to Catherine 's eyes.Who in the heck is this Marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig ? A totally extraneous and unnecessary character.One of the key elements in the book is the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine 's books . His monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his children 's spirits and his treatment of Catherine based on money concerns alone . He does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send Miss Morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home . Only her friend Miss Tilney 's thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded . This whole point gets seriously muddled in the film . They make the General too dark from the outset.Peter Firth should have not sung ! This part was painful to watch . His depiction of Tilney wasn 't too bad but it was a shade dark in places . Henry Tilney of the book made sport of Miss Morland 's imagination on trip to Northanger but he was never dark . Firth would have benefited from better direction . The young lady who played Isabella needed a better acting coach . John Thorpe was appropriately odious . The striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly ! It certainly fit his character.I think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack . It cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie . If I watch it again it will be with the sound OFF and subtitles on . Perhaps I would give the film a 4 then.The sound quality of the DVD was quite poor . The picture quality was not much better . This is glaringly noticeable on a digital television.When I think of what this film could have been , I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I was born , this television series was the number one show on T.V. ! ! America epitomized the feat of the ultimate fatted calf country with big ambitions , limitless potential , and a very comfortable economy ! ! After a big Sunday dinner , why not sit back and watch " " Bonanza " , " IN COLOR ! ! ! This homey western evokes an American tradition which accompanies the complacency of the typical U.S. household during the era in which it was viewed .. The breathtaking cinematography of Lake Tahoe symbolized an infinite prosperity of the emerging American culture ! ! Western Movies were so popular that Western Television Shows followed suit ! ! This was a period in time in our country which yearned for a concise reflection on our own country 's struggle for survival ! ! The end result of the trials and tribulations at the Ponderosa Ranch , as demonstrated in this series , sparked a realization that Americans are now auspiciously enjoying the fruits of the Cartwright 's painstaking labor ! ! The T.V. Show " " Bonanza " " was popular for so many different reasons , mostly on account of the fact that the late fifties and early sixties had not yet established the divisiveness of two different cultural mindsets which was ready to surface with our nation ! The unification of ideologies in the United States which prevailed during the debut of " " Bonanza " " was a big reason for the show 's success ! ! In the show 's later years , " " Bonanza " " had established a firmly entrenched core market television audience ! ! The cast to " " Bonanza " " became famous , and the wholesome entertainment of " " Bonanza " " encompassed a camaraderie for the All-American idealist ! ! Everybody liked " " Bonanza " " and a lot of Americans totally loved it ! ! Reflecting on rough and tumble family values is a favorite past time of many Americans , and the television show " " Bonanza " " was perfect for that frame of mind ! !

" I watched Cold Mountain and the English Patient again this weekend . The former is a Civil War melodrama about Inman ( Jude Law ) , a Confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to Ada Monroe ( Nicole Kidman ) a girl he barely knows . Both films were lovingly directed by Anthony Minghella who does an exceptional job . Although , Cold Mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy , backwoods dialog.Romantic epics need a convincing heroine . The English Patient , had Kristin Scott Thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart , alluring and beautiful Katherine Clifton . The main problem with Cold Mountain is Ada who seems silly and dim-witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that Inman could become obsessed after one kiss . As an actress Kidman has a limited range , she usually plays stern-faced women who face adversity with stoicism . Kidman was also too old to play the ing챕nue and Law 's love interest . The film needed a young actress who could play charming , warm and vulnerable . For someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well-fed and over-dressed . Kidman was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made-up for each scene . Michele Pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly . Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement.Renee Zelleweger was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for Kidman . Jude Law was in his own silent movie in the Odysseus role , but played his part well . Ray Winstone was excellent as the London / Southern villain.During the Civil War , people were probably not very well educated by today 's standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables . However if you watch BBC adaptations of Dickens , Austen or Mrs. Gaskill everyone is articulate . Maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Jeopardy is a tense , satisying thriller , a cut above a B but not really a major production . It qualifies as almost an experimental film , as the studio that produced it , Metro , was desperately looking for new kinds of films , stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television . The director , John Sturges , was an up-and-comer whose best years lay ahead . He had just recently begun directing A level films , and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman . Stars Barbara Stanwyck , Barry Sullivan and Ralph Meeker , were at very different phases of their careers . Stanwyck 's glory years were behind her , and yet she could still carry a film , as she proves here . Barry Sullivan , as her husband , was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him . He was a fine , low-key actor , poised , but in an upper middle rather than upper class way , which made him excellent in professional roles . As the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save Sullivan 's life ( he is trapped under a pier , and the tide is rising ) , Ralph Meeker is more energetic than usual . This excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after Brando and Clift . He was in his way as good an actor as either of them , but he lacked charisma . His bargaining with Stanwyck , which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband ( by implication only , as this is 1953 ) , makes for an intriguing premise which , had this been a different kind of film , could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about Stanwyck 's character . Meeker is indeed a more exciting character than Sullivan ; and in her scenes with him Stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son . But as this is a formula picture , not a Strindberg play , the possibility that Stanwyck might want want to have a fling , --leaving aside the question of her husband 's predicament , --remains unexplored . In this sense the incoming tide doesn 't quite have the effect one might have wished , though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting , fine location photography , nearly all of it outdoors , and excellent direction by the woefully underrated Mr. Sturges . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Forget Neo and Bourne and all those half-baked made up modern heroes . They only look 12 year-oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes . Since they cannot be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones , Hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick.However , their " " action set-pieces " " are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question . This explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years . For better ( Rocky , Rambo ) or worse ( Die Hard 4 - where John McClane , brace yourselves .... had no beard ! ! ) I say it is high-time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end . This " " Largo Winch " " movie is far from perfect , and perhaps too predictable at times , but at least Tomer Sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action-hero . And the only one time where he was weakened is when M챕lanie Thierry shaved his beard ! I rest my case.I didn 't know it when I entered the theater room , but this might be the movie I 've been waiting for a decade . For the first time in France since Belmondo , can a movie be both well- crafted and rooted in B-genre without blushing over its performance . In the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience ... In other words it was " " Le Pacte des Loups " " or " " Dobermann " " ( I like Dobermann , mind you ) ... I believe " " Largo Winch " " has what it takes to be both popular and quality film-making.I exited the theater room very pleased , and hungry for more . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw it at a German press screening . Without giving too much away : Most critics really seemed to like it very much . There was even applause afterwards , which is quite unusual for that species . From my point of view and until now , it was the funniest movie of the year . It keeps the charm and wit of the three W + G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies . Of course , there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies , especially to " " An American Werewolf in London " , " " " Jaws " , " " " King Kong " " and even to Peter Jackson 's " " Braindead " " / " " Dead Alive " , " but also to other genres.Characterization was better done in " " Chicken Run " , " but that movie had a complete new " " cast " " where introduction was necessary . Here , you are already able to know the two main characters . So , the new " " Wallace and Gromit " " -movie is enjoyed best if you watched ( and liked ) the shorts already , yet it also works on its own . " " Chicken Run " " had the more convenient , but also more " " storytelling " " plot . Instead , this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more " " isolated " " feeling of the W + G shorts . Children should also enjoy it very much , especially because of the sweet rabbits ( if you love cute bunnies , this is a must-see for you ! ! ! ) and because Gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show ( children also love dogs ... : - ) ) . But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience ( there are even soft sexual allusions in it ) . The movie manages , like " " Shrek 1 + 2 " " and " " The Incredibles " , " to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family , with adding a British and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of American animated movies.The animation is 혯 as expected 혯 superb , and they kept true to the Aardman style because they didn 't put in too many digital effects - I realized just a few when it came to Wallace 's inventions.Finally , the score works fine in the movie , although one of the main themes definitely is " " borrowed " " by Randy Edelman 's " " Dragonheart " " score.The bad thing is : It will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from Nick Park & Co . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I caught this movie on the Horror Channel and was quite impressed by the film 's Gothic atmosphere and tone . As a big fan of all things vampire related , I am always happy to see a new variation of the vampire mythos , in this case , a ghoul-like creature residing in a Lovecraftian other dimension . The director has done a brilliant job of conveying the dark mood of the subject , using the decadent art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a tale of love spanning time and space- the pure love of friendship opposed to the lust for blood and life by the vampires in the story . The characters in the story are transported to another dimension by the means of a mind-altering substance , where a shape-shifting vampire creature appears to grant them their hearts desires , whilst draining them of their life essence . There are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control , and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle . I enjoyed watching the 2 main male characters in the story , Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich , who were very attractive hunks , always a plus point in a vampire story for the female viewers ! The special effects make up and creature effects were well done , and the set design of the vampire 's dimension was very effective . All in all , an enjoyable take on vampire myths , and recommended for anyone who likes their vampires with some intelligence and not just action . The only thing missing to make it even better would have been a bit more eroticism and nudity , as it would have suited the plot and themes . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I own all family guy seasons so far and i have to say Vol . 6 has been the biggest disappoint of them all . There are still plenty of laughs to be found here but i think Vol . 6 like the last few volumes is slowly providing less and less laughs . At least for me.The biggest annoyance i had with Vol . 6 is it seems to be VERY heavy in left wing politics . I 'm a big believer in if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself but this Volume REALLY seems to shove their political view points down your throat and i think it takes a lot away from the show . Insinuated all conservative sates are horrible places , Insinuating we need more gun control , Insinuated school are under funded , Insinuated religious people are crazy , Bush is friends with the devil .. I could go on and this is just from the first three episodes.Sure some of it was funny but there becomes a point when you 're not making a comedy and you 're really just shoving your political views on other people . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a very strange HK film in many ways . First , many of the action sequences really aren 't that much fun . The very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly . Not cool silly , or even funny silly , but just silly . That 's not to say there aren 't some great action scenes , but most simply don 't come up to the level of some of the other films I have seen . The opposite side is that this film actually has CHARACTERS , not just people . All of the main characters are interesting ( except for the head bad guy , who is flat as a billiard table ) and most are fairly well acted . All the protagonists in this film are just fun to watch . The dialogue is quite witty , and doesn 't seem to lose much in translation . This film is worth seeing , but I hope that uninitiated American audiences don 't think this is the best HK has to offer . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Showtime " " falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy . Overall , it was pretty good ! As " " real life " " crime or cops go-- and plot , for that matter-- it is pretty illogical , but DUH--- this is a comedy . Also , while the special effects , chases , aerial shots , and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie , I found it a bit tiresome and overdone . 9 / 11 sensibilities aside , for myself , all that pyro-techno hyper-effect stuff had been getting really old these past few years . It seemed a lame substitute for characterization , story , and engaging emotions . I hope the lesser quantity of it in " " Showtime " " is an indicator of a trend in Hollywood . A trend downwards , of less use of the silly , less use of the exploding building.Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites . Their screen presence and charisma-- and even their character depth-- have been " " a joy to behold " " for many years . That can 't be dismissed here--- they are engaging actors , and entertaining and appealing in this movie . I can 't put my finger on it , but perhaps the explosions , the excessive FX , and all of that diminished the final product ? ? ? Perhaps , or perhaps it was something else , or a combination of factors that gives one the sense that the movie didn 't achieve its highest potential . Whatever it was , " " Showtime " " was entertaining-- I probably will buy the DVD when it comes out-- but I had the vibe that it nonetheless wasn 't all it could have been . At least not all I had hoped for.Very good movie , but not a great movie . I gave it an 8 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife ( who produced it ) took a Q & A afterwards.I found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to Harvey Keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he liked.Certainly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso , it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in Cuba . However , don 't expect this to be a movie about the revolution , it 's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous . Many references to the directors obvious love of film history ( a great " " Bicycle Thief " " homage " " ) and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious.Enjoy ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life . He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet , sleeves , and spear - made out of hubcaps , seat cushions , and discarded office furniture . Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante , " " The Man " " rides his contraption ( literally ) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth , away from the plight of modern man . Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world . Both characters are guardian knights of values unfamiliar to most of the other characters in the story.Unlike Cervantes 's tale , in this movie we identify more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character . We can only compare this alien and forbidding landscape to the lush and beautiful world we live in . Our frame of reference is the fantasy realm which the lone knight perhaps remembers . Our vision would be one which expects the main character to triumph , to vanquish , to change his world ( for the better ) back into a world of plenty that no longer exists.We look at this movie and see a true knight among a world of humans-as-animals . Don Quixote considered himself a true knight among animals.With Cervantes 's tale we can only see the dreamer , without really understanding the scope of his anachronistic displacement . In Besson 's and Jolivet 's tale we see the new world from the eyes of Don Quixote , because we value the same visions and ideals as the crusading main character . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
this was one of the funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen . This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16. this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning . I don 't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance . If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to see it . I agree with the idea of making this a HBO series . It would have an amazing following , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I enjoyed this film . I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that 's never happened before - a Secret Service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot . Unfortunately , for Michael Douglas ' character , " " Pete Garrison , " " they think HE 's the mole but he isn 't . He 's just a morally-flawed agent having an affair with the First Lady ! Since he 's doing that , he 's unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it 's revealed there is a plot to kill the President . " " Garrison " " is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he 's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the President . Douglas does a fine job in this role . I don 't always care the people he plays but he 's an excellent actor . Keifer Sutherland ( " " David Breckinridge " " ) is equally as good ( at least in here ) as the fellow SS boss who hunts down Douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth . When he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop , if they can , the plot . The crooks are interesting , too , by the way . Also , I have never - and never will , unfortunately - see a First Lady who looks as good as Kim BasingerThis is simply a slick action flick that entertains start-to-finish . Are there holes in it ? Of course ; probably a number of them , and a reason you see so many critical comments . However , it is unfairly bashed here . It just isn 't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website . My advice : chill , just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue . Yes , it gets a little Rambo-ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment ..... which is what movies are all about . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Nothing better than an android boasting 80 's technology and a coming-of-age storyline to pull your thoughts from the depths of your mind front and center to be taken captive by a beautifully lovable cast . Growing up in the 80 's gave me the priceless opportunity to see re- runs of " " not quite human " " on many special occasions . Considering the fact that my parents were never present during the viewings , I would guess that I would most likely not enjoy it near as much as I did as a child . So perhaps this is a film to dig out of your VHS collection and hand to your kids , it can be found on the same tape as " " The apple dumpling gang " " and an episode of " " tour of duty , " " that is if you recorded in LP mode of course . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am of " " the Christopher Reeve Generation " " it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play Superman yet , but that doesn 't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role , and George Reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock Chris off the top , though he just barely falls short . That doesn 't stop me from enjoying this film , it has a lot going for it . It has all that a movie needs , a plot with beginning , middle , and end , plus all those parts are intelligently written . The film is edgy both in acting and storyline , something a film-noir but with tights . The story is both exciting and meaningful , this is a movie with a message that isn 't too preachy . I am still amazed this was shot over 12 days , oh the glory days of Hollywood , when we didn 't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell ... The film is polished and expertly made , directed by Lee " " Roll 'em " " Sholem , best known for directing with both speed and efficiency . It never lets the constraints of technology slow it down , in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight , including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from Superman 's point of view , also a few closeups of George in process work , and a long shot of an animated Superman . This is now available on DVD as an extra feature on the first season of the George Reeves Television series . A DVD worth owning in its own right , the inclusion of the film as its original whole , is icing on the cake.Give Blood Today God Bless ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" It 's hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a Norwegian immigrant and would be chemist had on the American public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was viewed . But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary individual who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure Catholic college on the map.I 've heard clips of Rockne 's famous pep talks and it is uncanny how Pat O 'Brien got the voice and the inflection perfectly . In what turned out to be his career role , Pat O 'Brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was Rockne . Rockne is assisted by well by Gale Page as Bonnie Stiles Rockne who complained about her home being a training camp for Notre Dame , but never threw anyone out of her house.Rockne 's first impact on football was as a player with Notre Dame not a coach . One fine day in the second half of a losing football game against heavily favored Army , Rockne and team mate Gus Dorais played by Owen Davis used the forward pass as an offensive weapon . Before that football was simply a game where you just got bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense . Rockne didn 't invent the forward pass , but he popularized and football became a game of strategy as well as brawn after that . Rockne knew how to work the media also . Those well publicized pep talks of his were not just to inspire his players . They were well publicized and it was in a lot due to him that college football became a major sport in that Golden Age of Sports in the Roaring Twenties . Playing a small , but key role is Ronald Reagan . As George Gipp , the first player Rockne coached to achieve greatness , Reagan not only got a good performance , but forever after a name that was handy in his subsequent political career . That deathbed scene which Rockne swore was accurate became a Republican battle cry as many a GOP underdog went out to win one for the Gipper.I still remember a widely distributed photograph in 1981 that was one of the first of recovering President Ronald Reagan at Notre Dame 's graduation with his old friend Pat O 'Brien . Reagan always credited O 'Brien and Dick Powell of all the Warner Brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the kindest and most encouraging to a young player on the lot trying to make good.Notre Dame itself owes its prestige to Rockne . It 's quite possible that Notre Dame would be an obscure small Catholic College without the reputation that football brought to it.Though George Gipp and the later famous backfield of the Four Horsemen certainly had their place in the sun it was Rockne who had the reputation . It 's no accident that Warner Brothers was able to get Amos Alonzo Stagg , Glenn ' Pop ' Warner , Howard Jones , and William Spaulding , Rockne 's contemporaries and coaches with great reputations in their own right to appear in Knute Rockne , All American . It was there way of honoring the guy who was number one in their profession.I think more than football fans will enjoy Knute Rockne , All American . Though you might become one after seeing the film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market . This market is essentially dominated by the Looney Tunes and the Merry Melodies shorts , coming from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able of releasing hidden gems , like " " To Spring " , " an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year.In the environment depicted here , spring isn 't caused by natural cycles , but is fabricated . And by who ? By little male elves who live below ground . Each spring , when the snow begins to melt , they start working . They begin by felling rainbow rock columns , then reducing them to rubble and using this rubble to turn it into color fluids , which will be moved up to the ground and bearing grass , flowers ... In other words , spring ! The first half of the cartoon depicts spring 's fabrication , but the second part is a little bit different . Old Man Winter comes back and he tries to extend winter by destroying the elves ' work . So from this point , we assist to a battle between the elves and Old Man Winter.The music heard here is deliciously wonderful . The melodic parts stick in the head like an ink spot on a paper sheet . The second part melodies are thrilling and they perfectly fit with the action . This is just fantastico , Giorgio ! The animation sequences are also a delight . The colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown into a massive , epic environment . The concept itself is brilliant . The elves are attracting characters , so is Old Man Winter , who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season.There 's also a strong message included here . The battle seems lost for the elves at the end , until a single late arriving elf jump into the action and it leads to the elves ' victory over winter . So the point is : only one single person can make the difference.In conclusion , " " To Spring " " is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era . What is even more remarkable is that this cartoon 's director made his debut here . And who is " " To Spring " " ' s director ? It 's a certain William Hanna ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There are some excellent comments and observations on this film . I was pleased to note the comparisons to Fritz Lang 's " " M " " ( forget the 50 's abortive remake with lightweight David Wayne ) . The real villain is not the tortured murderer ( extraordinarily fine performance by Jeffery DeMunn ) , taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims-- mostly children . He is the objective . The real villain is the stifling bureaucratic Soviet system , drowning in its own corrupted incompetence . The frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man ( Rea in his best role since " " The Crying Game " " ) , a facile pragmatist who 's willing to use the system to his advantage ( Sutherland always successful in this kind of role ) , a hesitant , frightened but determined psychiatrist ( the incomparable Max Sydow ) , the bumbling , boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor ( brilliant Brit actor John Wood ) and the quiet , supporting wife of the driven investigator ( delightful supporter , Imelda Staunton ) . This is one damn fine film . Its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt , incompetent system which works against success . The is no need to dip into gore-laden slice ' n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films . Gore is present-- it 's a ghastly story-- but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being . The success of the story is precisely that : these were acts perpetrated by a person , a human like you or I. Where you and I choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means , Chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us , our children . The superb premise of this story is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors . --sadly , I note that our Australian friend didn 't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in Aussie dialect . Well , too bad . This fine film sure worked for me and everyone else I 've talked with who has seen it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Kevin Tenney 's " " Night of the Demons " " is an enjoyable horror film that reminds me a little bit " " The Evil Dead " . " On Hallowen night , a group of teens throws a party in Hull House , an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of town.Lead by Angela , they perform a seance-like ceremony and accidentally awaken the evil spirits that inhabit the place.One by one , the uninvited evil force possesses the teens , turning them into bloodthirsty demons . " " Night of the Demons " " is a perfect horror film.It is scary , gory and pretty atmospheric.The characters are well-developed and the gore by Steve Johnson is pretty good.There is a gruesome impaling , a tongue being bitten off , fingers shoved into eye-sockets , etc.The scene , where Suzanne ( Linnea Quigley ) shoves a tube of lipstick through her nipple is a hoot.Give this one a look.Followed by two sequels . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Once upon a time Hollywood produced live-action , G-rated movies without foul language , immorality , and gore-splattered violence . These movies neither insulted your intelligence no manipulated your emotions . The heroes differed little from the crowd . They shared the same feelings and bore the same burdens . Since the 1970s , the film industry has pretty much written off G-rated movies for adults . Basically , modern mature audiences demand large doses of embellished realism for their cinematic diet , laced heavily with vile profanity , mattress-thumping sex , and knuckle-bruising fisticuffs . These ingredients constitute the difference between G-rated movies and those rated either PG or PG-13.Miraculously , director John Lee Hancock , who penned scripts for Clint Eastwood 's " " A Perfect World " " ( 1993 ) and " " Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil " " ( 1997 ) , hits a home run with this G-rated , feel-good , four-bagger of a baseball epic that not only celebrates America 's favorite summer time sport , but also extols the competitive spirit of the game . Essentially , " " The Rookie " " resembles the 1984 Robert Redford saga " " The Natural " " about an old-time slugger who makes a comeback . Unlike " " The Natural , " " " " The Rookie " " shuns swearing , sex , and violence.Moreover , rugged Dennis Quaid plays a real-life individual . Jim Morris ' autobiography , " " The Oldest Rookie : Big-League Dreams from a Small-Town Guy , " " served as the basis for Mike " " Finding Forrester " " ) Rich 's unpretentious , Norman Rockwell-style screenplay about white , middle-class aspirations . Morris attained his dream when he debuted on the mound as a relief pitcher in 1999 . Although it doesn 't belong in the same league with the inspirational James Stewart classic " " The Stratton Story " " ( 1949 ) , " " The Rookie " " qualifies as the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes anymore because audiences find them antiquated.Hancock and Rich encapsulate their entertaining oddball biography in a halo of mysticism . A wildcat oil prospector convinces two Catholic nuns back in the 1920s to bankroll a West Texas well . Fearing they have blown their bucks on an ill-advised fantasy , the sisters blanket the arid terrain with rose petals and entreat St. Rita 's patron saint of hopeless causes ' to intervene . The well gushes ! The Town of Big Lake emerges , and roughnecks swat at baseballs when they aren 't drilling holes in the terrain . The spirit of baseball oozes from the earth like petroleum . Meanwhile , years later , the U.S. Navy doesn 't keep Jim Morris , Sr. , ( Brian Cos of " " Manhunter " " ) and his family in one place long before uprooting them . The constant moving takes a toll on Jim Junior . Jim 's dad shows little sympathy and berates baseball.Nevertheless , Jim has baseball in his blood , enough so that when he accepts a high school chemistry teacher 's job in his Texas hometown , he organizes a baseball team . Like the foul-mouthed " " Bad News Bears , " " " " The Rookie " " chronicles Jim 's triumph at turning losers into winners . Morris promises the team if they reach the divisional playoffs , he will try out for a professional baseball team . Predictably , Morris ' students maintain their end of the bargain . At age 35 , Jim stuns the big league scouts when he hurls fastballs at 98 miles-per-hour ! " " The Rookie " " never fouls out . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This begins a series ( which I 'll hopefully keep up every week-end ) of films that came out during my childhood 혯 in this case , it 's one I 've only managed to catch now . It was clearly intended as the last word on the subject , which basically had been debased to the level of hokum over the years ; however , in its uncompromising striving for a serious-minded approach ( a sure measure of which is that the protagonist is never once referred to by the name he 's been known all this time the world over ! ) , the film-makers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended primarily as entertainment ! Consequently , we get a decidedly staid representation of events 혯 with more care given to meticulous period reconstruction than in providing a functional thematic environment for its mythic jungle hero ! Even so , Christopher Lambert rose to stardom 혯 as did another debutante , Andie McDowell , playing his love interest ( named Jane , of course ) 혯 with the title role , which he handles creditably enough under the circumstances . However , Ralph Richardson ( to whom the film is dedicated , this being his swan-song ) steals every scene he 's in as Tarzan 's natural grandfather who , in spite of showing obvious affection for his long-lost kin , can 't bring himself to forget tradition in an effort to understand his predicament ; the hero , in fact , is much more comfortable interacting with primates ( even contriving , after having gone back home , to save his adoptive ' dad ' from captivity ) . The film is otherwise very good to look at ( with cinematography by Stanley Kubrick regular John Alcott , no less ) , features an appropriately grandiose score as well as remarkable make-up effects ( by Rick Baker ) 혯 and , while essentially disappointing as a Tarzan outing , retains considerable value nonetheless as a prestige picture of its day . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I first saw this film accidentally when they showed it on TV and I was up far too late ... I really lucked out there though . It 's truly incredible ; from the location ( as isolated as it 's possible to be on this planet ; it made " " the abyss " " look like ET in the council swimming pool ) , through the interesting characters ( Keith David is especially good as the reactionary Childs - " " What if we 're wrong about him ? " " - " " Then we 're wrong . " " ) and the effects ( more yucky than Alien ) .Moreover , however , the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects . It 's the people you start being scared of ; knowing that one of them may - or may not be - " " All they appear to be " . " It 's certainly got the feel of " " who goes there ? " . " The soundtrack is great ; it really plays up the isolation , fear , and gravity of the situation.Finally , the epilogue scene really , really cuts . Even more than the " " But then again who does ?

" The film version of Alice Walker 's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel ( written largely as letters from the central character Celie to God ) was a massive Oscar success , and rightly so.In the role of the abused and awakened Celie , Whoopi Goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles . Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia , the fiery woman tamed by fate . Others in the cast fleshed out the characters Walker had introduced so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert , Celie 's abusive husband ; Margaret Avery as Shug , a force of change for the good ; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak ; Susan Beaubian as Corrine , the preacher 's wife ; and the much-missed Carl Anderson ( otherwise best known as Judas in the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar ) as preacher Samuel.Beautifully paced and sensitively written , ' The Color Purple ' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature-length drama . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" An excellent period murder melodrama , with Fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type , in a role that reportedly Olivia DeHavilland turned down .

Scripted by Charles Bennett , who had written for Hitchcock in the thirties and also later penned the excellent script for the classic British horror film Night of the Demon . The opening scene , where Ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful Una O 'Connor ( the screecher of James Whale fame ) , is a tour de force , and the film maintains interest throughout the numerous sinister machinations .

It showed how people with Bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life , friends and themselves . The best line and the part that really shows what the problem with Bulimia is , is when Beth says , " " It 's not about you ! " " That line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem . It showed that people with Bulimia don 't have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else . It has to do with them and them only . It shows that it 's time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves .

" Wow ! Fantastic film in my opinion , i wasn 't expecting it to be this good ! I was captivated from start to finish- it 's a very well made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials Darwin had to go through in order to convey his ideas to the world , chronicling his life as he writes " " Origin of the Species " " ; fighting both personal demons as well as the ignorant society of the time in order to do so . He struggles hard with his mind , body and soul as personal matters get to breaking point and even his family seems to slip away ... whilst the rest of the world stand against him as he knows that his findings literally shake the very foundations of their lives , culture and meaning of existence . It 's a subtle movie ( not over-exaggerated in any way in that typical Hollywood way , this is a BBC produced British film ) yet thankfully very powerful in meaning and this is thanks to the amazing well directed scenes as well as the superb acting by Bettany . Connelly acts as more of a light supporting role but I did enjoy her in this and she 's as good as to be expected as always , her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and endearing , you could feel the connection , and their real-life husband / wife bond definitely shines through their performances . But the star of the show is definitely Bettany and he does a brilliant job , a very touching performance- i both understood and sympathised with him as he battled his own degrading health and impending " " insanity " " to try to understand what he has uncovered and come to terms with what it all really is and means as he found his thinking contradict his feelings , and found himself losing it all including his wife who of course was a firm believer in religion and a strict Christian whilst he was in the realm of science , two worlds which could not see eye to eye , so their relationship was at stake too.Anyway- a really very good , well acted emotional drama and dare I say I did shed a tear during the tragic climax which was truly heartbreaking as well as beautifully poignant and moving . The film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic as well , in fact i can 't wait to watch it again as there was a lot to take in first time round which i missed . Easily one of the best films i 've seen this year . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is an awesome non-stop laugh riot incorporating all the usual ingredients of a Dawid Dhawan comedy - bumbling heroes , buffoonish supporting characters , made-up dolls for heroines , nasty villains , wisecracks , rocking soundtrack + choreography and a little dose of action . Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen . The heroine of Amitabh the cop is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is opposite Govinda the cop . Heroines are mere rouge-smothered props as usual . The conmen have no heroines . Paresh Rawal carries his villainous act in DAUD forward ( He played a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT too ) . Asrani shines in a brief role . He does a retake on his famous " " Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer " " act in SHOLAY .Govinda is impeccable as usual - as a wisecracking , good-humoured policeman Pyaare Mohan and as a conman Chhote Miyaan . He imitates Bihari style of Hindi speaking with hilarious results . Amitabh Bachchan , believe it or not , pales in comparison with him . But still AB is fine .

When he did Raw a few years later it was also really good , but this is # 1 in my book . Also shows that at one time , particularly the early-to mid eighties , that Murphy was funny .

" I 've read that Paolo Sorrintino 's inspiration for The Consequences of Love came from simply observing a businessman alone in a Brazilian hotel , and speculating what he might be doing there . The film unfolds to us in a similar way . We view the existence of Titta who has lived alone in a hotel in Switzerland for 8 years . He is secretive and avoids friendship . His life is dominated by order and regularly . Gradually , the truth of his existence is revealed to us until , finally , his world begins to fall apart.The mystery of Titta is central to The Consequences of Love and it works thanks in large part to the superb performance by Toni Servillo . His character becomes all the more intriguing to us as little details are revealed - that he injects heroin once a week , that he has no imagination . Although some here criticise the dialogue for not being naturalistic , that doesn 't matter in my view - this is not that sort of film , and I think the script is great . The camera work is also excellent.If you have to criticise , the film does lose its way a in the later scenes as the mystery of Titta 's existence is revealed to us , and as his world begins to fall apart . However , the tragic final scenes are every bit as good as the earlier build-up . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Dolemite is awesome . Rudy Ray Moore 's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof . Citizen Kane this may not be nor Les Infant Au Revoir , but this is undoubtedly genius in it 's own right . The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects . The plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the snootiest film lovers through . The infamous ever present boom mike evokes shades of the gloriously incompetent Ed Wood and never grows unfunny . I sometimes wonder if the boom mike was left in on purpose as commentary on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general but i usually get distracted by erotic scenes that lack eroticism to the point of high art mundanacity .

" This movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end . Not that that is bad , it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character . Consequently , if you are not into tragedies , this is not your movie . It is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile . If you liked Dostoyevsky 's ' Crime and Punishment , " " you will probably like this if only for the comparisons . The intriguing question that the movie prompts is , " " What is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly-aproved ideas for another set ? " " The new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo-if you are a conservative you will not like this movie . Besides other philosophical questions , I must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well . The grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start . Also , there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters . If these sorts of things do not impress you , skip it . Overall I give this movie a 7 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There have been approximately 60 different films & Television plays , besides the classic Opera of this tale of a sex mad girl and her hapless soldier lover . This story has been done so many times , in various ways.Vicente Aranda directs Joaquin Jorda 's screenplay adaptation of Prosper Merimee 's classic novel & play.This is the story ONLY of Bizet 's opera CarmenPas Vega is an exciting Carmen , full of passion & the ability to drive simple men to do terrible tragic things . Leonardo Sbaraglio is the hapless soldier who is ensnared into Carmen 's poisonous web & led to doing bad things.Jay Benedict is the author Prosper who tells this tale.There is not much action , BUT there are some very hot sex scenes.In fact this is almost an NC-17 film.since I have seen this tale so often in so many guises I was not overly impressed.It is a very well made film & will be of interest to those that may not know of it , My not overly enthusiastic review also could be that I miss the fantastic Opera score by Bizet.See this as you may like it more than I did.Ratings * * * ( out of 4 ) 82 points ( out of 100 ) IMDb 7 ( out of 10 ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the first review I 've wrote for IMDb so bare with me , but I caught this flick on HBO and was sure glad I watched it . Richard Gere is great in this film as the passionate agent / detective who bends the rules to get the job done . I think the story is great , and there 's never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down . Some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking , but if you 've ever seen a crime film like Se7en , you 'll be able to stomach the scenes just fine . So all in all , if you 're looking for a good detective / suspense movie , ignore the low rating this movie got on IMDb and definitely watch it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Joshua Seftel 's first film - a satire of memorable proportions - is about just as the title suggests : The corporations effect on War.The film is about a mercenary ( John Cusack ) traveling to Turaqistan ( not a real country , fyi ) to help the American government ' get their message across ' to Turaqistan 's leaders . He meets a reporter ( Marisa Tomei ) and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man + a hot reporter . Somewhere in the mix , a pop star named Yonica Babyyeah gets thrown in . As Yonica is marrying one of Turaquistan 's most important people ( a son of the president ) , a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star , well , somewhat . The film starts off with a lonely Cusack in a bar ; no more than fifteen seconds later , the film hooks you . With it 's amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics , the film 's running time blows by you . The film has a lot more action than I expected , with the occasional scene of war , well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder . Though the story isn 't much deep , the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike.In the final act of the film , the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled . I thought it was executed very well , but other may disagree , and I could understand why . Twist after twist is what the ending is all about , and like most films , it is a true hit / miss situation . Regardless , the three writers on the film ( Mark Leyner , Jeremy Pikser & John Cusack ) did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today 's situation overseas.Joshua Seftel does an excellent job insuring the film 's integrity ; not reducing the material to the most redundant of films ( which I was afraid would happen ) . Seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could : he created a vibrant atmosphere , one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities ; - contrasting them perfectly - as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all . Seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely . No missteps here . Hopefully , he takes on more directorial jobs , for he is one director to look out for . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I loved this series when it was on Kids WB , I didn 't believe that there was a Batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997 . First of all I loved the idea of Robin leaving Batman to solve crime on his own . It was an interesting perspective to their relationship . I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series , and once again like it 's predecessor this show had great story lines , great animation ( better then the original ) , fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing . The only thing that I didn 't like was that was when it was in the US it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline . I just wish some of the episodes could be longer . My favorite episode of any Batman cartoons comes in this series , and it 's called " " Over the Edge " , " in my opinion as good if not better then " " Heart of Ice " " and " " Robin 's reckoning . " " Overall a nice follow up , along with Superman this show made my childhood very happy . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Farscape - is the one Sci-Fi Show which restarted the Interest in Science Fiction in me.But Farscape is so much more then plain and simple Sci-Fi . Comedy , Drama and much more : ) The Acting is very good . Luckily Farscape survived also it 's cancellation and showed with Peacekeeper Wars that it is not dead yet : ) I hope there is a future for Farscape : ) In my opinion it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the Show are muppets . You have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty Farscape is.Farscape set a new Standard in Television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than Farscape .

" Towards the end of his career Jack Arnold , a very efficient director who gave us such classic 50 's creature features as " " It Came from Outer Space , " " " " The Creature from the Black Lagoon , " " and " " Tarantula , " " teamed up with former football star turned top 70 's blaxploitation film headliner Fred " " the Hammer " " Williamson for a pair of movies , producing the amiable , if unremarkable Western " " The Black Bounty Hunter " " and this refreshingly breezy , clever and highly entertaining 70 's black action variant on your standard 40 's film noir down-at-the-heels private detective yarn.Williamson displays a charming combination of dry , self-deprecating humor and relaxed , easygoing self-confidence as Shep Stone , a cheap , affable , and forever in debt erstwhile Los Angeles cop turned private investigator . Stone 's so hard-up for cash that he uses a bar as his business office and just barely makes ends meet doing penny-ante low-paying minor cases that the police don 't want to bother with . While pounding the pavement for one of these deceptively simple gigs ( Stone 's trying to find some guy 's runaway teenage daughter who 's hiding somewhere in Hollywood ) , Stone finds himself elbow deep in a complex , dangerous , seemingly bottomless criminal plot which includes a flipped-out Jesus freak religious cult , assorted deadhead hippie dopers , a sordid porno ring , a priceless missing gold-tipped cane that belonged to a legendary silent movie star , a nefarious underground drug smuggling operation , and an ever-growing number of fresh corpses.While lacking the wickedly playful , mischievous ingenuity of Robert Altman 's masterful " " The Long Goodbye " " or the haunting , unremitting pessimism of Arthur Penn 's beautifully bleak " " Night Moves , " " " " Black Eye " " nonetheless still makes the grade as a highly successful hip 'n'flip 70 's spin on 40 's mystery suspense thrillers . Arnold 's capable direction keeps the pace moving at a nice , steady clip , punctuated with sporadic exciting mano-a-mano bare knuckle fight scenes and excellent use of various colorfully seedy L.A. locations ( the rundown abandoned amusement park at the film 's conclusion is especially effective ) . The script by Mark Haggard and Jim Martin supplies a goodly amount of fairly complicated and often genuinely surprising plot twists . And the expected array of quirky , rough-around-the-edges secondary characters are an interesting oddball bunch , with particularly notable turns by Rosemary Forsyth as an alluring , powerful lesbian model agency owner ( Forsyth has the picture 's best line , boasting to Stone when she first meets him , " " I 'm a whole lot of woman " " ) , Teresa Graves of " " Get Christie Love " " TV show fame as Stone 's loyal bisexual girlfriend ( the film 's casual , nonjudgmental depiction of both Foryth 's unconventional femme fatale and Graves ' equally atypical gal Friday is one of its strongest assets ) , and Bret Morrison , who did the voice of radio 's " " The Shadow " " in the 40 's , as a smugly sleazy porno filmmaker . All in all , it 's a modest , yet surefire winner . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and as I am about to study film-making in Canada of all places , I most certainly will bring this up in class.The story , centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself , is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single pun on time.If you simply couldn 't laugh during " " Hollywood North " " I suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away - you might have serious issues.Besides the wonderful script I also noticed the great chemistry between actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where they really just acting ? Jennifer Tilly ( playing a hilariously bad actress ) and Martin Landau , also delivered a very edgy , yet funny performance.Great film , even better cast . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" from the view of a NASCAR Maniac like I am , the movie is interesting . You can see many race cars from 1983 . Even tough , the racing scenes are not that much realistic . But I have to admit , that I haven 't seen any race before 1995 , because before that time , they didn 't show any NASCAR races in Germany ) from the view of a Burt Reynolds fan like I am , the movie basically is what we are used to see from Reynolds in the 80 's : Burt behind the wheel of a fast car , like in his Bandit Movies.If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds , this movie is a must-see . If you only love one of this 2 things , I also recommend to watch it . If you like neither NASCAR nor Burt Reynolds , you still should give it a chance , but remember , this movie was far away from winning an Oscar Academy Award.It is the typical humor of the 80 's . If you like movies like the Cannonball Movies , and Police Academy , you will also like that one . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Andy Goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order , expressing the Way through his sublime ephemeral art . Indeed , time and change is what his work is fundamentally about . I bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times . So it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film , he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect , and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world , the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all . He is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone ( if they do anymore ) , creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it . Mr. Goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature , and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways . And always with the utmost respect , gratitude and humor of a wandering , and wondering monk . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For me this wonderful rollercoaster of a film bears repeated pleasurable viewings . Its about the tangled lives of three very different people . Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer . Albert Brookes plays the unprepossessing but brilliant journalist . William Hurt is the affable but dumb new kid on the block , news anchor.The classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating Brookes in love with Hunter but she of course is attracted to Hurt.This film works on many levels . At the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new harvest of ones that you may have missed last time . Its also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance.But perhaps most importantly the film examines the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute . This is personified by the meteoric career success of the Hurt character in contrast to Brookes relative decline.Despite being fifteen years old the film has some startingly relevant messages about modern news values and the continuing decline in journalistic standards.This film is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was surprised to catch this on TV Friday , and I enjoyed it . Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and the numerous references to everything that could be considered " " cyberpunk " , " this was a fun movie to watch .

" OK , let 's get this clear . I 'm really not into sci-fi , but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1 . Jack O 'Neil takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate . A round device that creates a wormhole . It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds . It might sound like your usual sci-fi-series , but it 's not ! The plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci-fi-series . I find that great . It gives you things , happenings and such you can relate to , and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets . They have some of course but thanks to O 'Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology , there 's not many . The series has a nice blending of action , humor and drama . If you enjoy loads of special effects you 're not going to find it here . They don 't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film is wonderful in every way that modern action adventures are not . Take some time . Relax , enjoy . Think . People who see this movie as slow or plodding or dull really need to take a week off and watch it several times until their short attention span mind comes to grips with the possibility of being involved with a cause or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because it isn 't hurrying to make the points you so emphatically need it to make in the short time alloted .

" I gave this movie such a high mark because it was really cute , really funny , all while being unpretentious . I went to see this film when it was playing in the Philly area , and it was the centerpiece of a great night out with friends . The film is well written and well acted , and though it does feel a bit like a sitcom rather then a movie , that doesn 't take away from the film . You just don 't find comedies like this anymore , where you don 't have to shock people to be funny . The film centers around a Ukranian housekeeper that finds herself working for a young couple in need of help . Though at first she helps , soon she adds more craziness to their lives then the couple bargained for . Things get further and further out of control until .... you 'll have to see ! The banter had me laughing , even after leaving the theater . This film just put me in a good mood .

" This is the last Dutch language film Paul Verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream Hollywood films " " Basic Instinct , " " " " Robocop , " " and " " Total Recall , " " among others . He sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet Gerard Reve , an annoying self-centered writer with a morbid imagination . Gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a Literary Club meeting in sea-side town an hour or so from Amsterdam . Verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how Gerard 's imagination twists reality . Asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper " " and it says ' boom ' I read ' doom , ' when it says ' flood ' I read ' blood , ' when it says ' red ' I see ' dead . ' " " When he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it ; " " I lie the truth . " " He accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the Club treasurer , a beautiful wealthy salon owner . As he gets to know her and learns her husband has died , he begins to imagine she is ' a black widow . ' Is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess ? This is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory , I figured out is my favorite gender . Looking at his body of work it is seems to be Paul Verhoeven 's too , and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality . It 's a nice change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare . I saw it in 1983 and it is a film that " " stuck . " " , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
.. " this movie has been done when Hitler ( and Mussolini who is as well in the movie ) was at the top and many politics and even the Roman Church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of Nazism . Especially in USA there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in Germany and Europe ( Charles Lindenbergh for example ) .It would be as today a big actor would made a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac . Chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life , but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and IMHO a great demonstration he was a courageous man .

It 's still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing I don 't care for , as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled . He even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reelers with Roscoe Arbuckle.My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for presenting us with this episode , and for giving Buster 's genius full scope .

" Tomorrow Is Another Day is NOT the sequel to Gone with the Wind but a lovers-on-the-lam story , and a surprisingly alert and moving one as well . For a supposed hack relegated to B-minus features like The Devil Thumbs A Ride , Felix Feist proves adept at filling his work with unexpected , inventive details . Steve Cochran leaves prison after 18 years for killing his brutal father when he was only 13 , and now he 's still a tentative , gawky pubescent operating inside a man 's hulky frame . Lonesome , he visits a 10-cents-a-dance palace and falls for brassy , grasping Ruth Roman . But the sudden shooting of her police-bigwig boyfriend causes the ill-matched couple to hit the road , ending , like the Joads , in a California migrant-worker camp . Roman 's the revelation ; in her best-known role , as Farley Granger 's fiancee in Hitchcock 's Strangers on a Train , she was ill- and under-used . Here she modulates persuasively from bottle-blonde taxi dancer to sacrificing wife and mother-to-be ( and a brunette , to boot ) . Cochran 's almost as good , waffling between the suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of an under-socialized male . And the ending , while unconvincing , is nonetheless welcome . Along with They Live By Night and Gun Crazy , Tomorrow Is Another Day displays a redeeming sweetness and warmth that belie its film-noir pedigree . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The rest is great and I 'm sad to learn on IMDb that i can 't look forward to watching season 2 when i get back to the US . I 'm am just as disappointed as the other commentators that this showed much promise and quality and taste .

" If you want your vision of Chaplin limited to a lovable tramp and you get your belly laughs from pathos , watch something else . If , however , you love slapstick comedy as performed by one of the best , do watch this one.The image is of the tramp who really cannot get the girl .

But I felt into a trap perpetrated by ... who ? I don 't really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and , no matter how smart I think I am , I fell into it . But , thankfully , I bumped into an Argeninean film director , Martin Donovan , a man I love and admire . When I told him I wasn 't going to see it because I knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me right on the face and Donovan is a pacifist ! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why . I went to see both parts straight away and , " " Che , part 1 and 2 " " is the best film I 've seen in 2008 . It is , of such purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past . The regard for its audience is something that we 're not used to anymore . I don 't know if we ever were . Riveting , moving , without concessions and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary . We can see his soul , we can actually perceive it .

" Honestly , I went to see the movie , not because of the actors , not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category . Believe me , being a movie-freak , I have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime ( Ichi the killer , Irreversible , Hellraiser ) but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I have ever seen . The plot is plain stupid , the directing is awful , acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so-called " " Horror Soundtracks " . " There isn 't a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie , and some of the scenes are really hard to stand . ( especially the scene , where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries--horrible ) . I can 't understand why the movie was rated 16 in Germany , where normally the criteria are real tough ( e.g. kill-bill ( brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing ) even a movie like state of grace is rated 18 ) . No one can call this a Horror movie , because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public ( Showing the " " Creep 's " " face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision ) ; for me ( excuse my expression ) it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies . In some scenes you see violence , that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything . The plot has holes and flaws , the dialog is boring , honestly I can 't mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the British and Scottish accent.If I had something to say , I would ban this movie from the theaters , I fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap.I 'm looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and I 'd be happy to discuss about one or the other topic .

" I believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of 짙8000 but that didn 't really show . There wasn 't anything amateurish about the production or the acting , the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of Aberdeen . The actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious , deserted and uncharted planet , none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each-other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive . There weren 't any great explanations of what was going on , which can be really contrived , so a lot of the plot was left to your imagination rather like The Big Empty which was a film I also enjoyed . I found that I quite warmed to most of the characters , there were some perhaps unintentionally amusing moments , the men were so ordinary that you felt you could empathise with them and the film 's climax and ending were quite poignant . I think Mr Stirton and his crew should be quite proud of themselves I 've seen worse films with a budget of millions . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hong Kong directors crossing over to Hollywood to make movies is nothing new , with the temporary exodus of the likes of Tsui Hark , John Woo , Ringo Lam in the 90s . From their collective output , only a few movies ( or may I say just one ? ) made an impact at the box office . The Andrew Lau and Alan Mak partnership has been a tour de force in recent HK cinematic history , especially with their now famous Infernal Affairs trilogy which was remade into Martin Scorsese 's The Departed , so it 's no surprise when Hollywood comes knocking on the door.But without fellow collaborator Mak , who usually has script / story duties , how did Lau fare with writers Hans Bauer and Craig Mitchell ? It 's like the X-Files without the X , in the way the story is crafted , the characters and the parallels drawn with the Chris Carter series . Richard Gere and Claire Danes pair up ala David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson , only that they don 't belong to any federal investigative agency who bear arms , but are employees of Protective Services , who 's chief role is to ensure that sexual predators who belong to their jurisdiction , are kept safe from society when they are released from having served time . Hence they are the shepherds tending to their flock , only that their flock suffer from sick sexual perversion with the propensity for violence.The parallels in characterization are so blatantly obvious , that it 's just a cosmetic touch up on the outside . Like Fox Mulder , Gere 's Erroll Babbage is a strange , lonely man , consumed by his obsession in his quest to doggedly harass his flock to tote the line . Pained by a failed attempt to rescue a missing child , just like how Mulder pines for his missing sister , Babbage is shunned by colleagues and given the marching orders disguised as a retirement plan . He has deep disgust for the people he 's monitoring , sick of their crimes and what they stand for , that he has no qualms in using unorthodox methods , short of flying off the handle while dishing out illegal , preemptive punishment . At the same time , he too has strong urges that he has to fight against , in order not to cross the line into becoming like those he loathes . As part of routine , he also scans newspapers and tabloids for clues and leads toward his objective , that of seeking closure , salvation for himself , and possessing a strong belief that the truth is still out there , and he wants to believe.Danes ' Allison Lowry on the other hand , is the ing챕nue brought in to replace Babbage . But in the meantime while learning the ropes on the job for the next 18 days , she is required to spy on him , and to report his shenanigans , pretty much like what Dana Scully was tasked to do with Fox Mulder . As the disbeliever of pre-emptiveness and holding onto the notion that those discharged back to society have been cured of their temptations , she slowly starts to see what Babbage sees , and understands that it takes a whole lot more than being just a desk and administrative job if she truly wants to help people.And it is this discovery of the world of fetishes and deviant sexual practices , that we open all our eyes to , much like how 8mm starring Nicolas Cage brought snuff films into the spotlight . It 's a decent investigative drama with the usual red herrings , and my , are they really good ones as it made you wonder quite often if your guesses are correct , and you soon find yourself firing from the hip as you get proved incorrect at alarming frequency , though I don 't credit this to a tight narrative , but more from the sprawling number of characters ( watch out for Avril Lavigne 's cameo ) and sub plots . The scene in the darkened ware / shophouse was akin to Se7en 's David Mills and William Somerset when they raided John Doe 's apartment and find plenty of bizarreness inside , though here , given the subject nature , it wasn 't lingered upon much.Apparently , The Flock somehow decided that Enrique Chediak 's cinematography was good enough , despite its very strange style of having no style , utilizing almost every trick in the book to try and recreate feelings of watching another Se7en , only that this was deeply steeped in tinges of brown , rather than the doom and gloom of black . It does take a little while to get used to this , and I put this effect as one which actually distracts from what is happening in the story . Not a really good move though , with somewhat frequent repetition of scenes involving flashbacks.But The Flock still makes decent entertainment , though X-philes out there would probably find it hard not to picture their favourite actors in the lead roles , given so much similarities in character . Gere and Danes do put forth some chemistry as the old fogey ( heh ) and his prot챕g챕 , and while it 's not exactly great , Andrew Lau did manage to pull off something enjoyable . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too much for my taste ) . Great script and acting ( I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast ) . Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound . One of the best thrillers I 've seen since years . Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take . One point of critic ; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There 's a good reason that Walter Pidgeon is warning off Leslie Nielson and his crew from the relief ship , stuff he dare not dream about.As Doctor Edward Morbius , Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier . Since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter , Anne Francis . They are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the Krell.The records as deciphered by Pidgeon indicate the Krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin . The machinery they left behind is still functioning.Maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion . I see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it 's as fresh as it was in 1956 . The terms would change , we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive , courtesy of the enduring popularity of Star Trek.We might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship . It might look a lot more like the Starship Enterprise or the Ship from 2001 A Space Odyssey . It 's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change.The story behind Forbidden Planet is a timeless one , about mortal beings trying to play God.You can 't write about Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby the Robot . This mechanical marvel , put together by Pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the Krell was quite the hit back in the day . He got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the Robot from Lost In Space . His scenes with Earl Holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with Earl 's request for some home spirits are very funny.Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar , but lost to The Ten Commandments and the parting of the Red Sea . Forbidden Planet 's bad luck to run up against a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille.Classicists among you will recognize Forbidden Planet as a futuristic reworking of The Tempest which when you think about it could have been Shakespeare 's one venture into science fiction . My favorite among the cast is Warren Stevens who 's sacrifice enables Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what he 's dealing with.Never miss this one whenever it 's broadcast . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Creep " " is a new horror film that , without a doubt , will please many genre fans simply because it 's so down to the point and unscrupulous ! It has many genuine shock-moments , a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension . What it hasn 't got is logic and a solid plot but , to tell you the truth , that didn 't bother me for one second . When the end-credits start to roll , there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director / writer Christopher Smith ( in his debut ) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long , soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the " " creep " " in the London subway . The story revolves on the young and haughty Kate , who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor George Clooney who 's in town to present his new film . She falls asleep in the subway , misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network . Things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills / kidnaps people to experiment upon . Even experienced homeless people , security guards or sewer-workers can 't rescue her from this ravenous monster ! I really dug the creep-character ! He 's nauseating , hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating . Christopher Smith only leaves us clues and hints , and it 's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature 's origin and background . I reckon this isn 't very original , and I 'm sure many people won 't appreciate the lack of content , but I forgive Smith and I think it 's better this way than going over the top completely , " " Jeepers Creepers " " -style ( that particular film started out great as well , but as soon as the Creeper 's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort ) . The obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore ! There 's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up , as well as the sound effects , are very convincing . The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used . There also is some acting-talent present in this film , with Franka Potenta ( Run Lola Run ) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film " " Anatomie " . " Creep is terrific entertainment when you 're in an undemanding mood and Christopher Smith definitely is a director I 'll keep an eye on . Make sure you don 't have to take the subway right after watching this film ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it 's like they 're almost living the past over again . Jia Hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most . There 's moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job . However , this movie is not for everyone . Many people who suffer from depression will understand Hongsheng 's problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself . Others might see the movie as boring because it 's just so real that its almost like a documentary . Overall this movie is great and Hongsheng deserved an Oscar for this movie so did his Dad . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I can understand why some people like this movie , and why some people don 't . For me , though , I really like it , even if I noticed some good bits , and not so impressive bits . The animation was actually excellent , like Charlie 's dream . The characters were a mixed bag , the best being Anne-Marie , voiced by the late Judith Barsi . ( I was physically ill when I read what happened to her ) Also , Carface is a very convincing villain , especially voiced by the wonderful Vic Tayback ( I particularly loved " " Morons I 'm surrounded by Morons " " ) and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all the Don Bluth villains . Charlie and Itchy only just lacked the same sparkle , but I loved King Gator and his song . Some of the film is very haunting , like Annabelle 's " " You can never come come back " , " which kind of scares me still . Unfortunately , there were some bits I didn 't like so much . The story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused , but Disney 's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem . Also there were some dark scenes , that young children would find upsetting , but the ending is very poignant . However the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung . None of them in particular stick out , with exception of " " Let 's Make Music Together " " and " " Love Survives " , " and Burt Reynolds can 't sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better singing . All in all , a watchable movie , that could have been more , but is definitely memorable , and I would definitely watch it again . 7 / 10 . Bethany Cox , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a finely crafted movie with moving sequences , humor , and best of all a love story . Anthony Quinn is wonderfully casted and after seeing several of his movies , this has to be categorized as one of his best performances , besides Zorba . The movie makes you really wonder if its filmed in Romania , which apparently is not the case . It is sure to fool even native Romanians , with its authentic-like landscape , costume , and ways of life . According to IMDb it is actually shot in France and Yugoslavia , hmmm . The story is compelling , making you want to watch the entire movie over , to see if you missed something . It provoked me into researching to find out if this is a truth based movie , but to my disappointment , it is a novel based film , seemingly fiction . It seems a bit far fetched to have happened for real , but one never knows .... The one problem with this film , is that it doesn 't seem to cast any Romanian actors , and it is a film about a Romanian character . There are probably many Romanian fill-ins in the beginning , but maybe not , it is filmed elsewhere . The author of the book was Romanian , at least thats all fine and dandy - overall a masterpiece in cinematography . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just caught an episode about Brad , the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started . I have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart-breaking than his drug addiction . Here 's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks , and immediately upon arriving he insults Lance Armstrong , one of the greatest athletes who ever lived , and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general . Understandably , he is soon asked to leave . Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back , but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass ? At any rate , I was confused about how the show was put together , since it shows Brad at the height of his addiction . We see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine . I didn 't even know that was legal to show , but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that ? Do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good TV episode ? At any rate , it is an enlightening show , because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people 's lives . Sometimes it 's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict 's indifference , although I have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean-cut . There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost , but still , and maybe I should warn about spoilers here , everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the end , and I have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life . But still , it 's a show about people trying to help other people , and you can never complain too much about something like that혚 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" TV newscaster Kimberly Wells ( Jane Fonda ) and her radical camerman Richard Adams ( Michael Douglas ) are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happens . The plants managers play it down but Adams has filmed it all . Wells and Adams try to get it on the air but the corporation that runs the plant prevents it . Plant executive Jack Godell ( Jack Lemmon ) realizes there are serious problems and tests have been falsified . He tries to get executives to believe him--only they know it . Wells , Adams and Godell find all their lives are in danger.I saw this in a movie theatre in 1979 . I was only 17 and it scared me silly . To make matters worse the Three Mile Island accident happened around this time making the movie all that more real . Seeing it over 20 years later it doesn 't scare me but it still is an excellent film--it works as a mystery , a gripping drama and an expose on the nuclear power industry . Fonda ( with red hair ) has one of her best roles as Wells--she perfectly conveys her character 's growing suspicion and horror when she realizes a nuclear disaster could happen . Lemmon is ( as always ) excellent . He starts out believing in his company and the job and slowly starts to unravel when he starts finding things out . He was rightfully nominated for an Academy Award for this . Douglas is good but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by Lemmon and Fonda.A really great film--one of the best of the 70s .

Series 2 has got off to a great start ! I don 't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them . And this show makes you think like that ! These 4 30-something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic . So the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too . Its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices ! , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I too saw this film at a film festival , but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and original . In a sea of terrible features , shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting , A.W.O.L however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to " " The Outer Limits . " " The performances are solid , not that one would expect otherwise from Morse or McGinley , and the directing is sharp and on the money . I personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster 's comments with the film I saw . A.W.O.L is quite aptly written by Shane Black , who , as is usually the case , plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities , while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously . All in all A.W.O.L proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I first saw this film about 15 years ago , and I have been enchanted by it ever since . It is such a feel-good experience , that I could happily watch it at any time of the year . However , to me , it is the ultimate Christmas movie.The fact that it is in B & W is irrelevant - although I often wonder what it would be like in colour . You can just get that warm , glowing feeling watching the Christmas events unfold . Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together , and Greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character , Sakall is a blustering joy to watch.It is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain , but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it.I can 't wait for it to become available on DVD in the UK .

" The only reason I knew of Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI Critic 's Top 100 . For a top 100 it is not a very well known movie ; indeed , I had to look hard to find a copy , I got the DVD version for about half-price . Surprisingly it was only rated M15 + ( the uncut version ) .I doubt many will take notice of this review ( more like comment ) so I 'll make it brief.This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I 've seen , partly because of the use of montages , artistic filming ( very art-house ) and the unusual theme . There are many things in the film I still don 't understand ( I 've seen it twice ) , and it makes for an emotionally confusing film.The filming and acting were very good , and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable . The main character is Joe Buck , a ' cowboy ' from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute . He meets the crippled conman Enrico ' Ratso ' Rizzo and , of course they become friends going through the usual escapades . What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different.I felt the film didn 't really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection , although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic . You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews , but its pretty obvious from the start.I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes . The deprivation of humanity ( shown by the darkness of the city streets , the breaking-down tenements ) . Most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law ( a conman , giggolo.etc ) yet you can 't help liking them . Joe Buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic , while we begin to feel pity for Ratso later in the film.I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground-breaking for its period . At the time ( And even now ) it was definitely not a typical movie ( quite art-house ) . At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns , musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy pops up.On a personal level , I must say I quite liked the film . The imagery conveyed a dream-like quality . I particularly liked the scene at the party , the music , images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching . However , as a movie for entertainment 's sake it was a bit lacking ( not really my style of movie ) in thrills . This is a film to be savoured and appreciated , rather than a cheap thrills action flick.Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film , the characters and their motives were quite interesting . From what I understand from the flashbacks , Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother , although it still doesn 't seem to be relevant to the story . He is a happy-go-lucky young stud , who suppresses his darker memories . The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling . Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso , although I fail to see where they have got the idea from . The theme of homo-sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation , and later in Joe Buck 's encounter with a lonely old man , but it has little to do with the main story.Certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade ( it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel ) and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do . While it has a simple , sentimental story to it ( disguised by a hard edge ) the beauty of the film is in the strange , often psychedelic sequences . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ' The Luzhin Defence ' is a movie worthy of anyone 's time. it is a brooding , intense film , and kept my attention the entire time . John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender , eccentric chess Grandmaster , and Emily Watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family . The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story . All in all , this movie is one of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess Grandmaster , and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-mainstream , non-cliche feel to the film . Most people will come out of the theater thinking , and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am 13 years old and I am writing this review in my mom 's sign in . She will write her own review later . This is my all time favorite movie.It was filmed in England in 1944 . I watched it so many times when I was little that I wore out the video tape . I love this movie and it changed my life ! The beautiful landscapes . The mighty pie-bold thoroughbred horse . The plain little Irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done , compete in The Grand National Steeplechase in London with her most beloved horse , The Pirate . It all made me want to ride horses ( which I have done now for 7 years ) and learn everything I could about their breeds so I could also draw and paint them . It 's a ground breaking movie about winning against all odds , overcoming your fears , believing in yourself , and reaching difficult goals by working very hard . Also , the horse race scene was one of the best ever made and I have seen many movies with horse races . I never get tired of watching this movie . Everything about it is perfect .

" Okay , I know that 's clich챕 . Taken on its surface , this is a bad film- perhaps in a league with " " Plan 9 From Outer Space " . " The dialog is suspect ( but the Singlish is quite enjoyable ... ) , the plot is not quite believable , Gavin 's character overacts excessively . While watching the movie , somethings happen that truly make you wonder ... Handsome and Kim making out on a tank , Gwen eating a banana in a bath , just about everything Gavin says and does ( " " psssssssssssssssycho ! ! " " ) . These things taken separately are perhaps flaws . Taken together , however , they are merely quirks . Watching this movie with an open-mind ( especially if you 're not familiar with Singaporean culture ) , and with an open-minded group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughs and a memorable time . You can 't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece , or even expecting to take anything serious at all . If you can take this film for what it is - an underdog film about underdogs , filled to the brim with its own quirks - then you should have a good time watching this one !

" It is fantastic ! A sick and twisted tale of coincidence and deceit.The story is meticulously and ingeniously constructed . It is really a perfect mixture : it has all from suspense to humor and the story is told with lots of originality ... The film is built up like a puzzle which is assembled piece by piece , and resolves the story ... For the viewer there are plenty of surprises till the end ! ! I also had a little impression that the director has been inspired by some Hitchcock work . I 've also seen films before where you see the same event happening from different points of view but this film goes beyond that . In this movie everything is built upon what happens to a body that appears and disappears and appears again in a different location . Every actor in the story has his own secret and we come to realize it in a way that contributes to assembling the puzzle ....

" " " The Incredible Melting Man " " is a fantastically gross , trashy and energetic Z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him / herself ! The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70 's gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer 's " " The Quatermass Xperiment " " ... only a thousand times filthier ! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission , but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt ! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror ( can you blame him ? ) , Steve busts out of the hospital , leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind . Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently , as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh . The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of Rick Baker . The melting dude 's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader ! Another big advantage is that William Sachs ' screenplay doesn 't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches . The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film . Just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because , if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script , you 'll miss out on all the campy fun ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening , though they usually aren 't . Most modern horror movies fit into this category.Then there are those movies that don 't simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual . They actually frighten you to a level that you 've never experienced . " " Halloween " " is such a film . It takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe . But nearly all of them work . " " Halloween " " is awe-inspiring in its simplicity , and terrifying as a whole.The story is simple . Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) is babysitting some kids on Halloween night , while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago . Of course , the madman , later known as Michael Myers , begins killing the local teenage population , and eventually he comes after Laurie.Sounds familiar , right ? Just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore . Not a chance.I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of " " Halloween : " " " " Because of its title , Halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s . However , while Halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre , it is not a member ... " " He has a point , and for a number of reasons . First and foremost , it 's downright terrifying , whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests ( one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek , but most of those fail as well ) . Second , there is almost no violence ( very little of which is bloody ) . John Carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary , and he relies very little on it ( actually , the body count is pretty low ) . In fact , one can argue that this isn 't really a horror movie , at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie , each gorier and more sadistic than the last . He relies on ideas for scares , and also skill . Third , while some of the characters may do stupid things ( that sometimes seal their fate ) , they don 't do them because they 're dumb . The characters are real people , so instead of thinking that the characters die because they 're idiots , we 're frightened because they 're making a mistake.One of the main reasons why " " Halloween " " is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it 's real . Nothing is hard to swallow in this film . There 's no supernatural , there 's no ridiculously creative plot elements , or " " inventive " " murders , or whatnot . Instead , all the set pieces and camera work ( save the opening sequence ) are simple . Carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action . What we get is the feeling that we 're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us.Horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary , everything has to be perfect , and ideas never work twice . It 's a hit or miss game , which is why if I were to tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter has ( which I 'm not ) , they 'd seem primitive ( particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years ) .Acting here is not a plus point because it doesn 't need to be . This is a movie about scary ideas , not a movie about dramatic , conflicted characters . The actors act like real people , not characters from a story . Nothing more . The exception to this is whoever plays The Shape , or later known as Michael Myers . It can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill , but it 's hard to pull off ( and even harder to keep people from asking why ) . But the guy pulls it off , and the result is terrifying.This is Carpenter 's movie through and through . He directed it , co-wrote it , co-produced it , and wrote the chilling score of it . This is a man of brilliance , and his later movie " " The Thing " " supports this statement , though The Thing is not as scary as " " Halloween . " " Unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished , as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers " " recognize your potential . " " As good as this film is , it 's not without flaws . The famous opening scene is disturbing , but not very scary . And not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie . It 's not that it 's bad , it 's just that there 's no good reason to fear " " The Shape . " " Luckily , Carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience . While there 's no intimacy in this relationship , it fits the purpose . We grow to know the characters , but not so much that it 's disheartening when they die . But once the film gets to Halloween night , that 's when Carpenter kicks things into high gear and it NEVER stops until you get to the end.While " " Halloween " " may be flawed , it is only slightly so . It is an immensely terrifying film , and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies . Be warned though , this movie will scare the living hell out of you ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you love Japanese monster movies , you 'll love this action packed battle pitting an alien invader , intent upon conquering the Earth , and a " " Giant Robot " " with an armory of super weaponry . The alien , " " Emporer Guillotine , " " from the planet Gargoyle , has a army of thugs called , ( of course ) " " the gargoyle gang , " " as well as an endless supply of immense hostile creatures that are routinely loosed upon the Earth to smash buildings , make loud noises , panic the populace , etc . A little kid , named Johnny Sokko , has the Giant Robot at his beckon call , and sends the Robot , as needed , to beat up , and then blast these creatures . Johnny joins a group of " " good spies " " called Unicorn , and endeavors to help save the world.In spite of the campy nature , unintentionally humorous dialog , and the fact that the target audience was obviously children , this movie has non-stop action , colorful characters , decent special effects , and just happens to be downright fun to watch . Battle scenes are well executed , and frequent , as the storyline requires . The good guys and bad guys both made sure they had an inexhaustible supply of bombs , lasers , ammunition , and schemes to attack each other . In spite of the fact the movie was constructed from edited episodes of a TV series , the plot actually develops , and reaches an ultimate conclusion.The film has a positive outlook and appeals to everyone 's ( especially kids ' ) desire to destroy evil in its many forms . Kids may be the target audience , but it 's fun for everyone to laugh at its comical silliness ; yet , at the same time , root for the good guys to prevail and " " save the world . " " The acting is cheesy in places , but that is the charm : there are several lines of corny dialog ( possibly translation errors or possibly intentional jokes by the movie makers ) , and you 'll find yourself quoting these absurd lines later.Admittedly , this film is not high in production quality or budget . However , for what it is , campy sci-fi , it 's enjoyable for some laughs . I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that sort of thing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was lucky enough to see this at this years Tribeca film festival . I was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was . Director Griffin Dunne has done a great job assembling this film that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly . The main story involves the family and it is very thought-provoking and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene . The film as a whole has credibility and integrity , yet still has that commercial edge - an " " indie " " movie for the masses if you like . The performances by the cast are all excellent but it is Diane Lane who shines the brightest . Diane Lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be Oscar nominated . Early days I know , but Lane acts her socks off here . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was usually producer Alexander Korda 's advice on set to many of his underlings ; the film is credited with three directors but in truth Alex , Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped out , pushing it to six.For John Kobal 's 1987 book , " " The Top 100 Movies " , " his survey of 81 film critics saw The Thief of Bagdad reach 55th place . A closer examination reveals only Jose Luis Guarner , John Russell Taylor and Kobal himself actually voted for the picture , but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half-way mark.The outbreak of the Second World War saw the movie 's production shifted around England and America , eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars . Like Citizen Kane , it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love.The special effects , outstanding for the time , are still reasonable , and actually hold up if you squint . But it 's not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions . Among them is an amusing horse , constructed out of a kit model , which , when a key is inserted up it 's rear end , begins to fly . There 's also a killer toy of the six-armed Goddess Kali , ( perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her ) and a quite horrific-looking giant spider . Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet . But most memorable has to be Rex Ingram appearing as , in a superb moment of cinematic conceit , a djinn ( genie ) nearly a thousand feet tall ! Ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature , and adds an element of danger to the proceedings . And look out for the moment where he 's tricked back into his bottle ! John Justin does well as the Arabic king who , for some strange reason , has an English accent and a stiff upper lip . Sabu , the astonishingly muscled 15혯year-old , is near-namesake Abu , a likeably cocky thief . After they cross paths with the evil Jaffer ( Conrad Veidt ) , Justin finds himself blind and Abu is turned into a dog . When it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind Ahmed 's ( Justin 's ) perspective , we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues . In truth , the second half is someway the better , being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature.Three small songs pepper the piece , though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient ; I wouldn 't classify this as a musical . It 's all great fun ; Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads , Veidt is the boo-hiss villain , and Abu is the youthful , irrepressible robber . It may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s English movies , but once you 've sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in . Quite commendable . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

And in thunder ball the NATO / RAF itself loads the nukes into plane and in Never Say Never Again it is changed by an " " rouge arm of the Axe " " and air dropped over US and stolen in Caribbean .

" Watching Stranger Than Fiction director Marc Forster 's The Kite Runner is the cinematic equivalent of eating your vegetables because this art-house epic rated PG-13 is good for your movie-going diet . No , this isn 't the kind of movie that I like to slouch on the couch and eyeball at the end of a tough day . The Kite Runner isn 't your typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget about your troubles . First , no celebrity stars appear in it . Second , nothing is cut and dried , black or white , or so outlandish that you don 't believe an image that you see . Third , The Kite Runner lapses into subtitles when the characters occasionally speak in their native tongue . Fourth , Forster 's film isn 't a romantic trifle about boy-wants-girl , boy-loses-girl , and then boy-wins-girl back . Fifth , this foreign language film may make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your assumptions about life , friendship , and survival . The chief themes here are cowardice and redemption . The protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action that he must atone for at the cost of his own personal safety and integrity . Right , The Kite Runner is about redeeming oneself for the sins of the past . We 're talking about personal accountability , so don 't rent or buy this wonderful movie for a boy 's night out celebration or something to take the bad taste of the day out of your system . Based on Khaled Hosseini 's bestselling novel , this culturally enlightened melodrama about right and down initially looks like one of those light-hearted friendship movies about adolescents in the vein of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot . About a half-hour into its 127 minutes , this escapade about two youngsters who fly kites in Afghanistan turns dark and unsavory . Nevertheless , if you can handle the remaining hour of the plot , you 'll emerge gratified , relieved , and perhaps even entertained . The Kite Runner opens in San Francisco in the year 2000 as our protagonist , Afghan 챕migr챕 Amir Jan ( Khalid Abdalla of United 93 ) and his wife Soraya ( Atossa Leoni of The Florist ) receive two boxes of published copies of Amir 's first novel . No sooner has Amir had a chance to bask in his triumph of a life-time as a storyteller than the phone jars him from his reverie and he is drawn reluctantly back into a past that is best left forgotten for him . Rahim Khan ( Shaun Toub of The Nativity Story ) calls Amir from Pakistan to make a request . Rahim was a servant in Amir 's household back in the 1970s when Amir lived with his wealthy Pashtun merchant father Baba ( Homayoun Ershadi of A Taste of Cherry ) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion . " " You have one more chance to be good , " " Rahim informs Amir without sugar coating his request . Basically , Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan and then enter war-torn Afghanistan and rescue Rahim 's young grandson Sohrab ( Ali Danish Bakhty Ari ) who is being held a prisoner against his will as a sex slave for Assef ( newcomer Abdul Salam Yusoufzai ) a cruel Taliban chieftain and Amir 's once dreaded adversary . The Kite Runner shifts from San Francisco in 2000 to an extended flashback set in Kabul in 1978 when life was idyllic . Twelve-year-old Amir ( Zekiria Ebrahimi ) and the son of his father 's servant , Hassan ( Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada ) love to watch movies , such as John Sturges ' western The Magnificent Seven , when they aren 't flying kites . Incidentally , this is kite flying like you 've never seen kite flying . Not only do the kids fly them , but they also compete with other kids to see who can cut the strings of another kid 's kite . The kite fighting flight scenes generate the same kind of excitement that the dog fighting scenes had in Tony Scott 's Top Gun . Hassan is Amir 's best friend but unlike Amir , Hassan belongs to the reviled Hazara minority . Earlier , young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with young Assef ( Elham Ehsas ) and his two flunkies . Assef was about to beat them up , but Hassan pulls out his slingshot and threatened to use it on Assef . Assef had no choice but to back down . Meanwhile , Amir was prepared to suffer the hand fate had dealt him . Amir 's father Baba laments his son 's lack of spine and fears that he will grow up half of a man because he is a coward , unlike the plucky little Hassan who bails Amir out of predicaments . Anyway , Amir and Hassan emerge from the showdown with Assef without a scratch . Later , after Amir sets a new record with his kite flying and fight skills , Hassan runs after a kite to claim it . Hassan is the eponymous character referred to in the title . Hassan claims the fallen kite but he finds himself at the mercy of Assef and his two minions . Assef lets Hassan kept the kite , but his minions pin Hassan spread-eagle , belly down in an alley while Assef sodomizes the youth . Worst , a traumatized Amir watches the assault from nearby but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would have intervened for him.Aside from the extraordinary aerial scenes with the kites , The Kite Runner is down-to-earth , straight-forward stuff . When Amir returns to Afghanistan to rescue Sohrab , he masquerades as a Taliban fighter but he doesn 't carry a firearm . The rescue scene in The Kite Runner is rather like the escape scene from The Midnight Express . While Forster doesn 't explore the local politics or plunge us into the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here . Indeed , Troy scenarist David Benioff had to eliminate some parts of the book and the racial and ethnic prejudices aren 't clearly delineated so you have to accept some things on faith . Forster lensed the film in nearly China to give it an authentic look . Forster deserves credit for making this two hour plus epic fascinating . The performances , especially by the children , stand out for their believability . The Kite Runner is a film that you won 't easily forget . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This film is a variation of a theme we 've all seen over and over again - the Posiedan adventure in Space . The characters are all stock characters - feisty heroine , Judas , coward , etc. etc . The only question really is who 's next to snuff it . Sometimes this tried and tested formula works - like in this case - but more often not - like the truly mind-numbing " " Red Planet . " " So why does this one work ? Because it 's stylish . The acting is above average . And above all it isn 't predictable . The conclusion isn 't sign-posted . I really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end . That alone deserves top marks in my book.It 's an intriguing and entertaining movie .

" I wanted to see this movie ever since the previews came out . I don 't understand why everyone is so hard on this film . It may not all be technically true to the sport of rugby , but this film is not mainly about the sport . It 's about a rugby team that is taught how to be more than the world expects of them . They are taught to become men , and not temporally vain boys . Hollywood is never 100 % correct in their productions . They are there to make a product that sells . Something entertaining . The story of Coach Gelwix and what he has taught over the years is simply amazing . He teaches about service , honor , integrity , and moral cleanliness .

Anybody who appreciates lowbrow visuals and a hilarious script will without a doubt fall in love with this movie.Don 't expect pretentious , artistic-wannabe crap like the version of R & J with Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio ; this one knows its a silly movie and draws its humor from that . The acting is also surprisingly good , and you can just feel Sammy Capulet 's pain as he tries to put his brain back into his head.The soundtrack , which contains many original and high-energy bands like The Wesley Willis Fiasco , Supernova , and The Meatmen is also four-star . This movie should be viewed by all , because it remains faithful to the original story while still being jam-packed with Troma 's trademark gore / sex humor . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I viewed my videotape last night , for the first time in at least ten years . I found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory . George Hearn , of course , was the master of the role of Sweeney ; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wife 's death and his daughter 's disappearance ; at least not until the end , when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife . Angela Lansbury , on the other hand , creates a more complex portrayal , as Mrs. Lovett . She understood that Sondheim wanted that role to be something of a " " comic " " counterpart to Sweeney ; and even brings some tenderness into her courtship of Sweeney and her nurture of the boy Tobias . For those with long memories , this performance takes one back to her debut performances in The Picture of Dorian Grey and Gaslight ; long before Murder , She Wrote . Only a year ago I saw the musical at Lyric Opera of Chicago. with current opera superstar Brynn Terfel as Sweeney . Others have commented on the operatic quality of the score . My conclusion is that " " Sweeney " " works better with actors who can at least handle the vocal lines , than with opera performers who have limited acting skills . As a final note , I commend the performer who portrayed Tobias. with his mixed loyalties and confusion about what is going on around him . It seemed appropriate that he had virtually the last word . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Ya know when one looks at this Brian DePalma film today , I 'm sure there has been allot of criticism about how dated it is . Also , about the violence . When I looked at this film on VHS when I was 20 , I thought it was ulta-violent and gritty as well . But I didn 't get ' it ' .A few decades go by and man , how I know how much I didn 't get in this film ! ! This is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the 30 's / 40 's . How can you improve upon a classic ? Ya don 't . But you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the " " new immigrants " " during the most greed ridden decade , the over indulgent 80 's . DePalma , Stone and the gang present an ambitious , disturbing and darn right good film.Yes .... Disco was dying and New Wave / Punk were taking over but these immigrants from Cuba who had to make a new home in Florida couldn 't tell the difference . It was exciting , it was what they wanted but how to get it ? ? ? ? To these immigrants , there was only one way to get it in Florida where they were .. by having lots of money and to get the money , you had to take over running a drug empire.Al Pacino was fantastic to me as Tony Montana , the " " little train that could " . " What an amazing way to have your lead character look at America : to fight , kill , steal. lie , cheat all to get -- " " the money , the women and the power . " " That 's what Tony saw as the American dream.He wanted it , he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it . Tony Montana 's command of the English language was heavily saturated with the " " f " " word but what did you expect , Emily Post 's finishing school for him and his co-horts ? Look at how they CAME to America , what they knew , what they were exposed to . This is the way Tony and his crew chose to " " be all they can be in America . " " It was all about the power . Tony Montana would and did ANYTHING to achieve it .. it all its violent , lying , stealing , crooked , thieving glory.The part of the film that personified the 1980 's to me , is the money laundering . Tony 's crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank . Did those around Tony and his crew care ? At the clubs where he spent and drank ? Nope . Money was money and with money , you get the power . Tony was living high off the hog . He and his pretty blond American trophy he married played well by Michelle Pfieffer.After Tony Montana 's rise to power , he finds out its really crappy up there . He 's riddled with doubt , he 's drug addicted , he 's paranoid , he 's surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody take-over , his trophy 80 's American blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore , he needs to keep atop of his empire because ... he 's going down . And down he goes in a horrific violent fashion , but again I ask , what do you expect ? This is the quintessential 1980 's film telling you a warped tale of how some misunderstand the American Dream ... to obsession . It 's violent , bloody , overly so .. but it drives the point disturbingly home . Not all Cubans thrown out of Cuba who landed in Florida in the 80 's were anything like Tony Montana . Give me a break . But the showing of how miserable the 1980 's were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the USA to " " be somebody " " and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in America.Makes you wonder -- has anything from then -- been learned today ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a father of four in his forties I thought this film made compelling viewing - if not edge-of-the-seat stuff . I deserves a far higher rating than the 4.3 that it had when I wrote this . ( I gave it 7 . ) I agree with some of the comments about the characters but Cameron Diaz was , again , sparkling in yet another very different role . The plot was a little silly but the point of the film for me was beautifully summed up in the final , quite surreal , sequence .

At the very least something has happened that requires further objective ongoing investigating . I think this testimony from Buzz Aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress . Like all supposed documentary video , this one may be slanted , but it does contain further information and opinions from an accomplished American hero . Those don 't come along every day .

Better run than the stitched-together HOF . The hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in HOF . The doctor is very good . As well , Lon Chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman .

" I had watched ( and recorded ) this a few years back on local TV and , having been underwhelmed by it , I subsequently erased the tape ; however , when it was released by MGM as part of a " " Midnite Movie " " double-feature DVD of Curtis Harrington / Shelley Winters films for a very affordable price , I couldn 't resist giving it a second look ( this has since gone out-of-print ) . Actually , I received the DVD a few months ago but only now , with Harrington 's passing , did I get to it ; thankfully , this time around I was more receptive to the film and , in fact , now consider it one of the more satisfying WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE ? ( 1962 ) imitations ( with whom , incidentally , it shared screenwriter Henry Farrell ) .The film offers a splendid evocation of 1930s Depression America - with its child-star craze and sensational murders ( exploited during the fake newsreel opening ) ; it 's stylishly made ( kudos to Lucien Ballard 's cinematography and the set design by Eugene Lourie ' ) and boasts an effective David Raksin score . Shelley Winters , Debbie Reynolds and Michael MacLiammoir deliver excellent performances ; the latter is especially impressive as the larger-than-life and vaguely sinister diction coach ( though he ultimately proves a mere red herring ! ) . Also featured are Dennis Weaver and Agnes Moorehead ( hers is only a cameo , really , as the evangelist she plays is mostly heard over the radio ) .Many seemed to regret the inclusion of musical numbers by the kids ( including an amusing Mae West imitation ) , but I personally wasn 't bothered by them ; the film does slightly overstay its welcome due to an unhurried pace and ( perhaps needlessly ) convoluted plot . Reynolds - a musical star herself - is ideally cast as the dancing-school owner and , despite their on-set rivalry , she and Winters work well together . The latter , in fact , gives a more balanced depiction of paranoia and insanity than in WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO ? ( 1971 ) ; the narrative , then , comes up with a number of ironic twists that lead up to the expected Grand Guignol-type denouement . Apparently , the film was toned down ( it originally contained more gore and even a suggestion of lesbianism ! ) by producer Martin Ransohoff - against Harrington 's wishes - in order to get a PG rating ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a way cool fantasy movie . One of my faves , it really is so cool . The director is Bernard Rose who went on to direct Candyman , he made a great start with this film.The film about a girl called Anna who falls ill with glandular fever on her 11th birthday . She draws a house on a shred of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house is real . Each subsequent dream that she has is altered by the presence of whatever she adds to the picture . In her third dream she meets a boy she thinks she has created called Mark . She befriends him and their relationship becomes stronger as the dreams become darker and scarier.Charlotte Burke who plays Anna is a terrific actress and it is very strange that , after just one film , she should disappear and never be in anything ever again .

It has an exceptionally well thought-out cast with Mamatha being the crowning jewel , a superb production and possibly pre-production with Rajnesh at the helm , a fantastic journey of rural Southern India through the eyes of a 15 year old , a remarkable mixture of song and dance , traditional and modern , blended perfectly , and a beautiful backdrop of lush color of the flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience . What a towering achievement for a debut director ! ! The casting was absolutely dead-on . I wish India would come out with more of such films . This film will remain as one of my top favorites for my entire life . 9 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I thought this move was very good . There were a few things that were less than perfect , but overall , I was quite surprised . The courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic , but was real enough to be entertaining . I found that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it . Being a military pilot I could relate to many of these parts . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hands down , the best drama / comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too . Lorelai Gilmore ( Lauren Graham ) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path , which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder . Rory Gilmore ( Alexis Bledel ) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness , which surprises them both . With the help of Luke Danes ( Scott Patterson ) and Sookie St.James ( Melissa McCarthy ) and an enormous variety of other hilarious characters , this show easily remains one of my favorites . What really puts the show over the top is the complex yet , incredible and witty writing often using references from pop culture to the mink dynasty . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I 'm sure that most people already know the story-the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge gets a visit from three spirits ( the Ghosts of Christmas Past , Present and Yet to Come ) who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways . Dickens ' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite.While I grew up watching the 1951 version starring Alastair Sims , and I believe that he is the definitive Scrooge , I have been impressed with this version , which was released when I was in high school . George C. Scott plays a convincing and mean Ebenezer Scrooge , and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing . David Warner is a good Bob Cratchit as well.This version is beautifully filmed , and uses more modern filming styles ( for the 1980 's ) which make it more palatable for my children than the 1951 black and white version.This is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that I watch almost every year at some point in the Christmas season . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals , this movie is not for everyone.The story is very similar to other movies , in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age , and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family . She does that by choosing some kind of sport , and with the help of a local boy , that for some reason falls in love with her , she confronts her problems and wins.In Girlfight it 's boxing , in Bend it like Beckham it 's soccer , and now it 's Kung Fu.But Fighter is much inferior product than these two , it was simply embarrassing to watch it . Semra Turan , the " " actress " " that playing the role of a teenage girl , maybe can do a lot of things , but one thing she can 't do is to act . Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy , the dramatic situations , in which she tries to show some emotions , are dreadful , her body and facial language are of amateur actress , badly instructed by the director . The rest of the cast is a little better , but they just cannot save this clich챕 movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot . Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer.Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this , it 's just so boring . The slow motion was really unnecessary , the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration , and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions , not actually fighting . Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys , and knocks them off their feet . The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it 's European . It 's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from Denmark , but don 't be fooled , it 's not . It 's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems , which are , by the way , not really convincing.Bad movie with embarrassing lines , acting and story . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters , as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.The horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors , playing parts.I have never gotten so immersed in a film as I have this one.Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on screen , as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty , Ronny Cox , Bill McKinney , and though he appeared only briefly , James Dickey , the man who authored the book upon which the film is based , as the sheriff of Aintry.It is somewhat disturbing , and kids , of course , should be shielded from it , but this is great , dramatic cinema . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

What could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they 're supposed to be spying on ? And most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal.But the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense . You can see real people behind the unreal lines . And the directing is wonderful . Each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too long.I showed this to several friends in the mid-80s because I was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie .

" It 's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot . Also loved hearing her sing . Nice change to see her out of her CSI / West Wing / ER roles . The movie itself was entertaining , but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts . Several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why . Each character was quirky though and in some cases , I couldn 't wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next . This movie wasn 't full of squeaky clean people , but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes , feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

What a wonderful , wonderful story . Drama , sadness , some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had . I watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over . Give Iphigenia a try and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did . I have even gotten my children ( 27 , 25 , 20 and 17 ) to enjoy it . It starts slow , however , the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story .

" Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors . Lorne Greene , Pernell Whitaker , Michael Landon , Dan Blocker , and even Guy Williams ( as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he was leaving the series ) . The cast had chemistry , and they seemed to genuinely like each other . That made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have . It also made many of their best stories into great western drama.Like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season , there are bound to be some weak ones . However , most of the time each episode had an interesting story , some kind of conflict , and a resolution that usually did not include violence . While Bonanza was a western , the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction . While I am a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted : Dead Or Alive ; those shows usually ended with a gunfight . Gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict , and Bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing.In the early years of Bonanza , there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights . Those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series , but they are pretty good in and of themselves . In 1964 , when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show , Guy Williams was brought in to replace him . Williams was playing the role of a long-lost cousin . Unfortunately , Whitaker decided to stay one more year , and thus Williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry Adam 's old girlfriend . If Williams had stayed on for the duration of Bonanza , one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 , when Pernell Whitaker left the show.Undoubtedly , once Pernell Whitaker left the series , the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks . Whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes , and his absence left a void in the cast . Little Joe always wanted to play the nice kid , and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold . Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family , that did not leave too much room for any gunfights.At some point they hired a ranch hand called Candy ( David Canary ) who became their fourth member of the cast , but Candy was never featured in any gunfights , and he was hardly more than an older version of Little Joe . For a year or two they also had Ben take in some other lost cousin ( Jamie , played by the forgettable Mitch Vogel ) who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone.Apparently by adding the teenager , the studio was looking to attract younger viewers . It also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems , alcohol , delinquency , etc . Those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter-culture movement . Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order TV , though Hawaii 5-0 , The F.B.I. and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing TV shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief , mayhem , and crime.The addition of a teenager to the cast gave the Cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems , but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general . After Dan Blocker died , the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled . The last season was pretty bad , as it featured Little Joe tracking down the killers of his wife , and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because Little Joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife , and how unfair it was that she was killed.I don 't think I have ever seen the last episode of the series , and I wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way . By the last year , there was only Ben ( Lorne Greene ) actually living on the Ponderosa , as Adam had moved away ( and never came back even once as a guest ) and Hoss had died and Little Joe had left after his wife ( in the series ) had been killed by drifters.Overall , the era from 1959-1965 is the best of this series . Once Adam left , it slowly declined . Most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too . By 1970 , the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical , and it had lost a lot of its western flavor . The addition of Candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show , and the death of Hoss ( Dan Blocker ) was the final nail . Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made , and of the 465 episodes that were produced , at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama ! That is a pretty good record . Even the worst of Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Spoiler Alert - although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain . ' Mulholland Drive ' is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch 's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his ' Twin Peaks ' TV series . As Lynch enthusiasts know , his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir , horror movies , surrealism , and parapsychology 혯 with a healthy dose of postmodern self-consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure . All these elements are richly at work in ' Mulholland Drive , ' making for a riveting , hair-raising , and highly satisfying film experience 혯 especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical , mystery-unraveling whole.The film features wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways amid a Hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality , retro ' 50s nostalgia , and satirical self-aggrandizement . Their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the film 's opening scene , in which Harring 's character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous , not to mention horrific , automobile accident . Staggering down the hillside from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard ( the two most archetypal of Hollywood thoroughfares ) , she finds her way to the very apartment that Betty ( Naomi Watts ) is about to sublet from her ' Aunt Ruth , ' a purportedly successful actress who is off to Canada to begin a new movie . As we later learn , Betty had herself arrived from Deep River , Ontario , shortly after winning a jitterbug contest.A highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that frame Betty 's descent from the clich챕d would-be-starlet 's bright-eyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bit-part actress . Unable to remember her own name , the Harring character adopts the name ' Rita ' from a movie poster for the film noir classic ' Gilda ' that adorns Aunt Ruth 's apartment . ( Actually , it turns out Aunt Ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we 're really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings . ) Anyway , Betty determines to help Rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in Rita 's purse . The two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to Rita 's true identity . They also , by the way , become lovers , at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that I cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of Lesbian lover affairs ( if a Lynch movie can ever be designated ' mainstream ' ) .At the local Winkies restaurant ( a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade ) , Rita 's attention is caught by a waitress 's name-tag reading ' Diane . ' This leads her to a recollection of someone named ' Diane Selwyn , ' whose apartment the two women soon visit and , at Betty 's insistence , break into . I won 't reveal what they find within , but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness . Subsequently , Rita wakes in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show / theater called ' Silencio , ' where the arts of illusion and lip / instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue- Haired Lady , as she is noted in the end credits , reigns as the presiding Muse . Framed by the blue-lit , red-curtained Silencio Theatre , the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film , perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination 혯 rather like Steven 's " " man with the blue guitar " " as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.During the Silencio sequence , and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison 's ' Crying ' ) , a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita 's purse . Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of purses , the moment is a singularly Hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings . Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the sought-for Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes ( i.e. Rita ) . Camilla in turn is a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and , more significantly , to whom she is emotionally subjugated.After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film , the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in ' Vertigo . ' While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much , if not all , of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself , other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from ' Twin Peaks , ' including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob- variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.However one fits the pieces together , though , the whole of ' Mulholland Drive ' is much greater 혯 and more mysterious 혯 than the sum of its parts . Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive , provocative , and pleasurably disturbing mind trip . What 's more , the film 's cinematography is stunning , the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics , the acting superb , and the directing / editing masterful . This may well have been the unacknowledged Best Picture of 2001 among major American releases . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Some movies you just know you 're going to love from the first few seconds . This is one of those movies . Tracing it 's roots back to " " Double Indemnity , " " and " " The Postman Always Rings Twice " " in the 40 's - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90 's . Nick Cage plays the " " down on his luck " " main character who gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people , town , violence and threat of Red Rock West . Lots of twists and turns , great performances by Cage , Hopper and Walsh , an hypnotic slide-guitar musical backdrop , and seamless directing make this a real joy .

" I am salivating for the sequels . I needed something to keep me from going insane with tension , anxiety ( what if it isn 't as good ? ! ) , and constant lack of information . I needed something to calm me a little , something to pass the time , other than , of course , The Matrix . This was just the thing . I found it informative ( like the part about Keanu 's neck ... ) and some of it was funny . I pitied Carrie-Anne soooo much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys . I found only one problem with it . Given that 95 % of the people there were as a matter of fact male , they just kinda let their mouths run wild , and there was language in it . It 's not near as bad as The Shawshank Redemption 's cussing runs , but that one scene were Keanu is describing a bad day , plug your ears if you are little . > It was entertaining and was just what I needed . It is what all Matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet .

" Set in Venice mainly on the Lido , Visconti 's " " Death in Venice " " is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of Dirk Bogarde 's characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods . For those who love Venice , this is a film to cherish.Mahler 's music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama . The mood it creates is not always happy . But then what else would you expect with a title like that ? There is not a lot of dialogue in the film . Rather sparse in fact . It 's mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests . The intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of glances between Gustav von Aschenbach a composer of some renown and a slim teenage youth Tadzio who see each other from time to time across the tables of the hotel dining room , on the beach and at odd unexpected places around Venice . They seem to acknowledge each other 's presence shyly at first with little more than the suggestion of a smile but later with a strong and riveting and urgent gaze.Each viewer will have his own interpretation . The composer has lost a child of his own . Is this behaviour an expression of yearning for the child he loved ? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction towards this fragile young man with his dazed somewhat girlish stare ? Could he be discovering some new inspiration for a yet unwritten musical masterpiece ? Who knows ? From beginning to end this film captures the true spirit of 19th Century Venice . The elegance of the ladies , the deck chairs on the sand , the children frolicking in their neck-to-knee bathing costumes , the glow of sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world . While some may think the pace is rather slow at times , the film has an overall gentle quality , but with a simmering indecision between two repressed human beings .

" I 've seen a slew of " " 80s rocker horrors " " over the years , from rubbish like " " Terror on Tour " " to ridiculously fun gems like " " Slumber Party Massacre 2 . " " Somehow I managed to keep putting this one off , which is strange because it 's probably the most popular and well received one . Well , I finally caught up with it and it 's easily the best of this mostly awful ( but almost always endearing ! ) subgenre . The plot ( which was pretty much lifted in the film " " Black Roses " " ) concerns a mulleted misfit named Eddie , whose ridiculed by all in his high school for his taste in music . He loves 80s metal , especially his idol Sammi Curr ( played by the late great Tony Fields . ) After Sammi is killed , Eddie favorite radio DJ gives him Sammi 's final recording . Once Eddie plays the record backwards , he discovers he 's a bit tougher , and bad things start happening to those who taunt him . Is Sammi 's music possessed ? " " Trick or Treat " " is well-made and a total hoot . The special effects are awesome , even though it does feature the typical 80s laser beams . I grew up in the 80s , and while I wasn 't a fan of heavy metal , I do remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards hearing the sounds of Satan worshipping . Haha ! I also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both KISS and Ozzy worshipped Satan , so it 's very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio DJ and a anti-rock priest . If only I had seen this film as a kid ! While the film seems to poke fun at the popular connection in the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal , the viewer never really finds out why Sammi Curr is back from the dead creating havoc and killing whoever gets in his way . This is movie 's weakest point , but if you can overlook that , it 's loads of fun . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This version of the Gulliver stories is definitely bizarre . The production adds a frame story ( that 's what it 's becoming famous for ) of Gulliver returning to his wife and son . In one vieweing , incredibly overlong and sometimes fails to hold attention throughout , but the odd images and diverse cast will keep you looking . Mary Steenburgen does the best job of the cast . Danson seems a bit out of place with his American accent . The whole asylum thing is awfully disturbing often , but is nonetheless interesting and holds the journeys of Gulliver together well . Danson 's character really does seem insane , however ... he should have worked on being a little more believeable to everyone , in my opinion . Also confusing is going from present to past .

" More a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your typical dragged out biopic , this fun and fabulous film has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indie-type film . I think the tendency would be to portray Bettie Page as some sort of sex vixen , like a Jayne Mansfield . But if you 've truly looked carefully at Bettie 's poses , she always looked happy . Not a " " you wish you could get with me " " haughty look , nor the " " I 'm just doing this because my acting career didn 't work out " " look of a porn star . And so , the ladies involved with this film ( three female producers , a female writer / director , female co-writer and the lovely Gretchen Mol , who I 'm sure helped shape this role with her own sugary influence ) really captured the idea of a sweet , somewhat naive , southern girl who really enjoyed having her photo taken and hoped that good ol ' JC wouldn 't be too upset with her . Gretchen Mol turns out a career high performance ( she may just have the most perfect breasts ever ) , which I am happy about , because she did have the curse . Several years ago , she made the cover of Vanity Fair when no one really knew who she was , touting her as the next It-girl . And let 's be frank , that was a bit presumptuous . I mean unfortunately she has never made it to Gwyneth status , though not for lack of talent . Making a few poor film choices when you are a pretty blonde in fickle Hollywood renders you forgettable I 'm afraid . If this doesn 't put her back on the A-list , well I 'll be a monkey 's uncle.Intensely private , Bettie herself has not seen the film yet . Bettie left the pinup party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame , Jesus . Whatever floats your boat honey . You were one helluva woman . I hope you 're happy wherever you are.Congratulations Mary Harron , you 've done our cult idol justice . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead actor Fabian Stratas ' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland , a reference to the film 's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national , an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people . His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females , commencing with the delicious Camilla , thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians . Fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish-eyed perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic flair and intimacy . ( ARGENTINA ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I agree with the above comment , I love the realism in this , and in many movies ( not just movies on eating disorders ) the producers seem to forget that . They take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again , which I dislike because its not reality . Not meaning to say things can 't get better , and not meaning to say things don 't in this movie , but it doesn 't spend most of the movie creating all these problems , and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again . When people have eating disorders people don 't just admit it and want to get better , and then life is peachy , it takes time , and I like how in this movie we grow with the characters , we go through the difficulties with them , getting better and worse , because it is a very important part of the movie . It gets into the minds of people with eating disorders , and shows the complications and pain , in a very realistic way , and I loved that . I also love how it shows The secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders , it is scary to see how people react when they find out , especially if they approve of it . I thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told , and defiantly one of my favourites . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I lack cable-vision and no longer have " " DirecTV " . " So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases . Being a lover of blondes but not blonds , I of course not only have " " Barb Wire " , " but I have " " Stripperella : The Complete First Season " . " I 've not yet found " " VIP " " or a second season for Stripperella . I have the " " Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding " " DVD . I have the issues of " " Playboy " " that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in . I could go on . I love Pamela ! There is no one or anything that could make me feel guilty about enjoying Stripperella . But there are certain elements that I dislike , but live with , for other series depict smoking and alcohol consumption too , some times . But those are my personal peeves and I try not to let them ruin the fun of a series like this for me . I too was taken aback by the change in animation style , but I adapted . However , the amount of female nudity decreased , and that is a big disappointment as one expects a lot of it in a series with a premise like this . But then again I adapted . One of my favorite episodes of " " Mork & Mindy " " was when they got to meet Robin Williams ! So of course one of my favorite episodes of " " Striperella " " is when Pamela & Tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin ! If there really is a " " Season 2 " " I hope that I can find it , for as a completest , I need to complete my collection . I recommend this for other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes . ( Hey ! Psst ! " " Blonde " " & " " blondes " " are the feminine form for spelling " " blond " " !

" Horror movie time , Japanese style . Uzumaki / Spiral was a total freakfest from start to finish . A fun freakfest at that , but at times it was a tad too reliant on kitsch rather than the horror . The story is difficult to summarize succinctly : a carefree , normal teenage girl starts coming face to face w / extremely disturbing events as the small town she lives in seems to come under the control of spirals . The spirals are everywhere , in the air , clouds , dirt and everyday objects . The spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them . Oh , another thing , people are randomly turning into snails . Why ? Who knows or cares , people are turning into snails , that 's enough for me . This wasn 't as much scary as just creepy as it doesn 't have a lot of suspense or jarring attacks as horror films often do . Uzumaki prefers to creep and crawl ( like a snail might ! ) rather than to jolt . A favorite scene : a woman lies sleeping in a hospital room when this long , thousand legged centipede creature makes its way into the room and slowly up the bed post , across the sheets , over the pillow and into her sleeping ear . I cringed and curled my toes . Uzumaki has a handful of scenes really violent but that are sort of humorous as well . For example , a man is obsessed w / spirals , he gets into his washer because he sees a spiral in it when it spins , he commits spiral suicide inside the washer . The last shot we see of him is w / his body all coiled & rubber like , a human flesh spiral w / a engorged single eye blinking in the middle of the washer . A bizarre image . Uzumaki has a blatant psychodelic slant to it which adds to its charm and fun . I love horror movies like this . It 's not about killing , a la slasher films , it 's about a force of evil ( the spirals ! ) taking over you and trying to kill you , force you to kill others . Films like Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror film and thank goodness for that , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a great movie . I love it more each time i watch . Most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags , but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo , or Hank Azaria says good-bye to Louise Lasser , or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography , or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches the news report , or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens -- is a pleasure . This is pitch perfect ensemble acting . The story develops directly and consistently , the action sequences are creative and not too dominant , all the set-ups payoff by the end . Seriously , if you 've seen it and it 's been a while , watch it again , and if you haven 't then get started . You can 't watch it again until you 've seen it the first time .

" A political satire of a comedian ( Williams ) who after dissing the political campaigns and presidents is forced into the running . But shockingly we wins and makes a mockery of the office . " " Man of the Year " " is not the funniest movie nor the best but in small doses it does work . Williams again teaming with Levinson after a hit with " " Good Morning , Vietnam " . " The two seem to have a great chemistry and work off each other . I am not comparing them to Scorsese and DeNiro but you can get the picture . Although I wouldn 't quite say to rush out there and see the movie in theaters I would recommend renting it . This movie is a comedy but also has a great satire , please if you like movies like " " Scary Movie 4 " " this is not for you , take your brain with you to see it . - * * * , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Fred was such a great show.It was simple but somehow very addicting.I can still remember the days when I 'd watch this on Kids WB Saturdays , but then Kids WB did the unforgivable.Kids WB became like that older relative that tries to act " " hip " " and " " funky fresh " .

" There is a lot wrong with this film . I will not lie . I will say that most of the problems feel like they stem from a budget that was chopped out from underneath the flick , and some bad hack job editing.This is not Office Space . Do not go in expecting Office Space levels of comedy . It is very funny though . It is a mess , but very funny at the same time . A funny mess of a film . In the way that Caddyshack is funny . A mess of unrelated funny scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes.It works as a whole though , and it certainly deserves a wide release . This is the best commentary on the Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV nation you could hope for . The very fact that a film is exploring the idea that dumb people are breeding at an alarming rate while the intelligent people are not , is great in my book . Not very politically correct but worth at least some debate . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " In Cold Blood " , " adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capote 's famous novel , deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals . The film excels as a character study of the killers , particularly trigger-man Perry Smith ( Robert Blake ) .The cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease . Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities . They play off of each other effortlessly while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character 's idiosyncrasies . The rest of the cast is merely average and isn 't worth remarking on.Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction . In my opinion , both were excellent , though the script does miscalculate with some ill-advised narration in the late stages . The Oscar-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top-notch , as is the editing . Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the film 's four Oscar nominations.Unlike so many other crime films , this one doesn 't glamorize violence . Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them . Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach . I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have reasons to love the great users of a camera ; fluid direction of action lends itself to fast-paced adventure and comedy narrative ; but such a skill , in the hands of a King Vidor or an Anthony Mann can also be applied to idea-level work . This is Paul Wendkos ' masterpiece . Its storyline can be retailed in a single pair of sentences . General Hector Cordoba is setting up as near-emperor in Northern Mexico , and steals a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. he sends his crack mission unit , divided , apprehensive but determined , led by George Peppard , to get the cannon back and bring back Cordoba alive , to put an end to the rebellion . Charismatic Raf Vallone plays Cordoba ; the ladies in the piece are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York ; with the squad even further comprised of Nico Minardos , Peter Deuel , and Don Gordon . Other stalwarts in the class include John Larch and John Russell . Also horning in on an already fantastically-dangerous operation are Miss Ralli , and a stubborn Mexican Teniente ( Gabriela Tinti ) whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba set up on his own . The danger is multiplied when Gordon 's brother as advance spy is captured and tortured to death while he has to watch ... and he decides he needs to kill Peppard . The attack that captures the cannon , when Peppard 's orders are not obeyed by a regular army type , is one of the most electrifying visual and staging achievements in cinematic history ; the penetration of Cordoba 's stronghold , the revelations uncovered there , and the actions that win the mission team a chance at victory--or almost victory--are flawlessly presented . This is a beautiful color adventure film , with unusually strong costumes , acting , lighting , art direction sets and music by Elmer Bernstein . The script by Stephen Kandel is probably his best ever for a feature film . This is probably the most underrated major western at the moment , but I have always appreciated its heroes as result- getting hard-workers . But as Peppard reminds his group on the way home , " " The trouble with being a " " hero " " --is the morning after " . " To find out why he says so , you will have to see " " Cannon For Cordoba " .

" Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . This movie wasn 't it . It plodded along at a pretty slow , deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes , but there wasn 't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there 's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno 's character and an old man , but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character , whom I didn 't know much about and couldn 't really relate to at the time . He wanders around alone for the most part , he doesn 't meet anyone ; I imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or something , which is all good , but I still wish he 'd trimmed it down from 40 minutes to 15 , because it can get incredibly boring.But after those 40 minutes , things start to get very interesting . I guess I won 't really say more than that because I don 't want to spoil anything . So if you 've seen the first 15-30 minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off ( like I was ) , just stick with it--it gets a lot better.One of the most interesting things I found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever , which really made me have to think about what was happening , how characters were feeling and what their motivations were , why things were how they were in this post-apocalyptic world , all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation . And it 's amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors aren 't telling you exactly what 's going on . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ( Mild Spoilers ) Frankie Machine had been dealt a bad hand in life . A card dealer at an illegal gambling den in his Chicago neighborhood he was busted when the joint was raided by the cops and given six months in jail .

Soild performances by the entire supporting cast starting with Frankie 's friend Sparrow , Arnold Stang . Sparrows attempt to get Frankie back on his feet by shoplifting a suit of clothes for him ends up putting him and Frankie in the slammer , and almost back to prison , until his former boss at the gambling den Schwiefka bailed him out .

It 's there that he goes " " Cold Turkey " " and almost ends up dying trying to kick the habit in one of the most harrowing sequence ever put on film.A no holds barred movie with explosive performances by everyone involved makes " " The Man with the Golden Arm " " one of the great classics of realism in motion pictures coming out of the 1950 's . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Another fun , witty , frothy RKO musical with Astaire and Rogers , FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming film . While it lacks the stand-out great tunes of SWNG TIME ( although the final number " " Face the music and dance " " is one of the team 's best and rightfully so ) , it is hugely enjoyable , as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930 's . Once again , the plot is lightweight and forgettable , but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is sheer heaven . These two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene .

" I was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute . It is brilliantly shot , with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed . The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike . She hires an assistant at work , with her true intention being to find love . He 's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her . In return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off . The film transcends into a dark film noir , with a couple of truly excellent scenes , and an even better finale . The real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character 's disability . The use of sound keeps the tension consistent , and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping , that 's for sure . Throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you 've got the makings of a great film .

" Wonderland is the fascinating film chronicling the x-rated film star John C.

" I first saw this movie years ago and have continued to view it several times a year when I have an opportunity . It is on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics . Should anyone tell you it is foolish or outdated , ignore them ... this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music . The dancing isn 't as important in this film as in other Astaire movies so the comedy and acting shine through . See this movie if you can , it may be light but it is still completely amusing . So I know that many people hate black and white films , they think old movies can 't really be funny , this movie should make them change their minds . No one I know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused . The only problem with the film : Fred Astaire singing without dancing . He may be a great performer and capable singer but it just isn 't fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story . The comedy gets a bit clich챕 at times but the vaudevillesque performances of G burns and G Allen are just perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone looking for some easy laughs . Give this film a chance even if you don 't like old movies , this movie can appeal to the ridiculous in any one . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Dudley Moore , ' Not Only ... But Also ' saw his ex- ' Beyond The Fringe ' collaborator Peter Cook guest on the first show , and so well received was it the controller of B.B.C.-2 insisted that he be on it every week from then on . They were a classic comedy team - Cook was tall , handsome and witty , while Dudley was short , charismatic , and musically gifted . The sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub , wearing flat caps and mufflers , fantasising about movie stars such as Jane Russell and Greta Garbo . It remains one of the most hilarious skits of all time , and even when Cook corpses it still holds together well.Those characters - idiot Pete and even-bigger idiot Dud - found their way into every episode of the show proper , seen in a different setting , such as a zoo or an art gallery . In the latter , they munched sandwiches while discussing works of art . " " That Leonardo DaVinci cartoon ... I don 't see the joke ! " , " says Dud . Pete points out that when it was first unveiled it probably had people in fits . Dud nearly chokes on his repast . " " You really are enjoying those sandwiches ! " , " ad libs Cook . The pair bounced their humour off each other in a way that was joyous to behold . The sketches themselves set new standards for comedy , standards that would not be matched until the arrival of ' Monty Python ' .As the show 's popularity increased , so did the quality of the guest stars . Peter Sellers for instance , and John Lennon , the latter presenting a filmed item based on his poem ' Deaf Ted , Danoota , & Me ' . ' One Leg Too Few ' - had Dud as ' George Spigott ' ( a name later re-used in the film ' Bedazzled ' ) , a one-legged man , who hops into the office of film producer Cook to audition for the role of ' Tarzan ' . Cook tries to let him down as best as he can . " " I 've nothing against your right leg ! " , " he says . " " The trouble is - neither have you ! " . " Dud would on occasion interview the eccentric Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling ( Cook ) , who when he was not teaching ravens to fly underwater , was planning on opening a restaurant called ' The Frog & The Peach ' . Another classic was ' The Leaping Nuns ' ( also reused in ' Bedazzled ' ) . But my all-time favourite has to be ' Superthunderstingcar ' , a wickedly funny ( and accurate ) parody of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson 's ' Thunderbirds ' . Pete and Dud played all the roles , with the latter making a fetching ' Lady Penelope ' . ' Ludwig ' had Ludwig Van Beethoven as the star of a ' This Is Tom Jones ' style variety show . ' The Immortal Bargo ' was a spoof documentary on the life of reclusive movie star ' Emma Bargo ' . In an unforgettable moment , she drove through London , bellowing through a loudhailer : " " I want to be alone ! " . " A Season 3 feature was ' Poets Cornered ' with the likes of Ronnie Barker , Spike Milligan , Barry Humphries , Willie Rushton and others suspended over a gunge tank . They each had to improvise the line of a poem , and anyone failing to make it rhyme wound up in the nasty stuff.Three seasons were made in all , produced ( at different times ) by Joe McGrath , Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert . Sadly very few editions survive . To make matters worse , the scripts were destroyed as well . It beggars belief that this situation was allowed to happen.The show ended in 1970 . The comics then hit Broadway , made the infamous ' Derek & Clive ' tapes , but Cook 's ever-increasing alcoholism broke them apart . Eight years later , Cook announced that a new series was in the offing , but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part . His ex-partner was making films in America , and had no intention of working with Cook again ( not at that time anyway ) .Enough footage was scraped together for a season of B.B.C.-2 repeats in the early ' 90 's . As expected , some items had not held up as well as others . Cook died in 1995 , and by way of a tribute the B.B.C put together a programme compiled from various ' Parkinson ' interviews and ' Not Only ... But Also ' shows . It ended rather appropriately with Pete and Dud finding themselves in Heaven . " " Bloody Hell ! " , " exclaimed the latter . Moore passed on in 2002 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" An especially delightful film to those of us who saw this when young because after all it was meant for the young to watch - when viewing it again as an adult it 's better if rose-tinted spectacles can kick in . It was the first of the 16 Jungle Jim films and later TV series chunky Johnny Weismuller went on to do for Columbia ( in the last 3 films he had to use his own name though as they 'd lost the rights ) after getting the sack from playing Tarzan for Sol Lesser . Johnny Sheffield also gave up playing Boy to become Bomba the Jungle Boy in a series of 12 films.Jim and party go on perilous safari to hunt down the hidden temple of Zimbalu manned by an obscure tribe of devil doctors who seem to have the secret of a poison that might also be a cure for polio . Edgar Rice Burroughs probably approved . After 16 years talking monosyllabically Weismuller seemed awkward stringing sentences together , not that it mattered . On the swift march we meet many of the interesting but generally playful denizens of the jungle , barring the sinister crocodile going to eat the leading lady with her leg caught under a twig and the surreal elephant stampede ( stock footage squeezed into a corner of the frame ) . Skipper the dog and Caw-Caw the crow had many adventures , none of which turned out essential to the plot in case you were concentrating ! The biggest problem with the film is the farcical climax , which can be exciting but also unfortunately remind you of the end of a serial part 혯 and the original excellent serial had been made 12 years prior . Although personally I wouldn 't have minded this going on another couple of hours as well ! The only thing heavy about this was Weismuller ; in so many ways an enjoyable kids film from the old days - not recommended for serious adults so I love it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I didn 't realize just how much of this episode was taken from The Enemy Below until I finally saw the movie ( it has since become my fave war flick ) . There were a couple of elements lifted from Run Silent Run Deep as well . Nothing wrong with stealing ideas , as long as you do something cool with them . And boy did Roddenberry and company do something cool with this one.The story begins when the Romulans violate a 100-year old treaty and by crossing the neutral zone and destroying a series of Federation outposts along the zone , ostensibly to test their superior weaponry and invisibility screen ( and subsequent shift in the balance of power between the Romulans and the Federation , in their view ) as a prelude to an all-out invasion . Kirk has to decide whether it 's worth risking war to try and stop the Romulan ship , or if in fact the greater risk lies in letting the invaders go after they destroyed 4 military outposts . Kirk wisely chooses the latter.This is our first look at an enemy of the Federation , the Romulans , a warlike , yet in their own way honorable race who are distant relatives to the Vulcans . However , unlike their peaceful cousins , the Romulans did not renounce their emotions and violent and imperialistic ways , even as they advanced technologically.None of this matters to Mr. Stiles , the ship 's navigator and this episode 's chief antagonist on board the enterprise ( the Romulan commander has his own problems with a gung-ho junior officer ) . All that matters to him is he hates Romulans and Spock looks like one .. until the end when Spock saves his life ( naturally ) . This contrasts sharply with Captain Kirk and the Romulan commander , neither of whom has any personal ill will towards the other at all . Both men are simply doing their duty . In fact there 's a mutual respect . This is the first Trek episode to deal directly with prejudice , and it does so deftly ( as opposed to season 3 's not-so-subtle " " Let That be Your Last Battlefield " " ) .Like The Enemy Below , we have a classic chess match between two ship commanders who are actually very much alike . You see right away that both of these captains are good .. VERY good . If you were going into battle you 'd want either of these man as your leader . Both are honorable and decent men who are duty bound . Yet even though the Romulan commander is bound by duty to his home world , he still finds himself wishing for destruction before he can make it home rather than start another interstellar war . Yet he still does everything he can to make it home , just as Kirk does everything he can to stop him.This is , in my opinion , one of Trek 's 5 best . It has everything : Plenty of action , suspense , great dialogue , fine acting ( I still maintain the Romulan Commander was Mark Lenard 's best Trek role ) , and it manages to make its social commentary without being overly preachy . A pity Roddenberry forgot about the last part when he did TNG.Watch this episode , then watch The Enemy Below . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My first exposure to Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli production company was when an English-dubbed version of Spirited Away was released about 7 years ago . What a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was ! So on that note , I managed to get my movie theatre-employed friend to see this new film of Miyazaki with me especially since he loves all things Disney ( this movie 's U.S. distributor ) . Once again , all I can say is " " Wow ! " " What awesome visuals concerning the way water is depicted as the ocean ... and what about the title character 's transformation from a goldfish to ... and seeing how some characters ' demeanor changes ... and , well , watch this movie if you want to know what I 'm talking about . Oh , and the voices being used for this American-dubbed version : Tina Fey , Betty White , Liam Neeson , Cloris Leachman , and Lily Tomlin . Good choices all . Does everything make sense ? No , but that 's part of the childlike charm that permeates throughout . There 's plenty of funny scenes concerning Ponyo and the boy and many other people they encounter . Oh , I think I 've written too much so I 'll just highly recommend Hayao Miyazaki 's Ponyo . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Oshin befriends an endangered samurai , falls in love with the gentle fellow , only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with Oshin to marry his promised betrothed . Oshin 's heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically / monetarily by Kikuno and the other geishas.A handsome samurai Ryosuke ( Masatoshi Nagase ) enters Oshin 's life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her . Kikuno is beset by problems , deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her , and coping with a rich but abusive customer . All the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street , Oshin and Kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by Ryosuke . The manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice , love , and devotion . The sea is watching and will find protection for true love.The photography by Kazuo Okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful : night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent . The acting is a bit strained for Edo art , but the characters are well created and keep the story credible . The one distraction which is definitely NOT something Kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky Western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real Japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track . But in the end there is enough of Kurosawa 's influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema .

" " " Slaughter High " " is , perhaps , the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s . It is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout . That being said , it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula : A group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdown.The reason why " " Slaughter High " " stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over-the-top . Marty , the killer , has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates . They electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl 's locker room shower , jabbed at his crotch with a javelin , and , to top it off , rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure him.So , the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get . When they reunite years later -- at a high school reunion put on by Marty himself -- you realize they haven 't matured all that much . They 're a bunch of sociopaths.It is mind-boggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion , which , by the way , is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair . And who would think it 's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers -- as well as Marty 's -- on display ? There are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film . The ending makes little or no sense . And the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how April Fool 's Day works : The movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon.In all , the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre , despite all of its flaws . It is hard to understand why it hasn 't yet found its way to DVD , when so many other run-of-the-mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is , without a doubt , one of the most accomplished debut films for any director . The Movie is only 90 minutes long , but manages to say just about everything about life and death . Not much action , and dialogue is minimal , but the movie flows perfectly and demands your attention due to the wonderfully natural feel of everything going on . The performances by the leads are perfection , and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes . The movie will be somewhat lost on today 's modern audience , but this is one that everyone ought to see.Refreshingly unsentimental and honest , this is on par with Ozu 's works . Scratch my title , this one is perfect ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have been hooked on " " GG " " since midway through 2001-2002 ( 2nd season ) , when I tuned in to see " " Smallville " " 10 minutes early . Thanks to " " Beginnings " , " I now have all but 2 episodes on tape , right up through last night ( Ep . 4.9 ) . I am a middle-aged straight male , and this is the ONLY weekly TV show I watch . I love this series because : a ) Lauren Graham is a damn fine-looking woman , and funny and smart to boot ; b ) the dialogue is extremely well-written ; c ) it is flat-out hilarious , putting overrated garbage like " " Everybody Loves Raymond " " to shame . Many current TV comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and much-despised slime-pit known as " " Married with Children " , " where the viewer is encouraged to deride and feel superior to the characters . In " " GG " , " the characters have faults , but we can see our own foibles in them , and laugh with them , not at them . This is stimulating TV , where the writers challenge us to keep up with rapid-fire exchanges and out-of-left-field pop-culture / literature / current events references . I get immense pleasure out of watching these episodes over and over again , catching all the one-liners and references to previous episodes . Stars Hollow is its own little world , one that I will happily continue to visit as long as the series runs . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was beautiful and touching . It touched a place deep inside me and I 'm not sure why . I am a happily married woman and I 've never had lesbian tendencies , but my , this movie almost made it something I crave . The choreography , the storyline , the dialog ... the movie was a work of art . The synopsis without spoilers is that a woman gymnast unsatisfied with her life and looking for ... something , anything . She is with a man who does not want a baby , but she does . He 's not mean to her , but he doesn 't treat her the way a woman should be treated either ... I guess he doesn 't really appreciate her . All these years she has stayed in shape and decides to go back to the gym . She meets another woman during her acrobatic training and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds . Throughout the movie she has another woman friend that she trained with in her younger years , and they have stayed close friends.The relationship that unfolds is .. I don 't know quite the word , but very understanding , comfortable , intimate but sexy ... something that could only exist between two women . The kind of relationship that could really bring meaning back into your life . Someone that makes you feel special , exciting , beautiful , confused even.The relationship with her close friend is beautiful in an equally different way . They have a close and intimate relationship . Her friend showed me what a true friend really is . Someone who is understanding , easy going , REAL , fun to be with , someone who is there for you no matter what . Someone who is supportive , and you can huddle with and tell your deepest secrets . Someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets . The story is simple in the fact that it was not overdone , but not underdone in any way . It leaves a lot of sensual imagery to capture it 's moments . The dancing and choreography was stunning . I could watch it over and over . The way the artist captured the main character 's feelings and emotions was . The dancing and the imagery was very dazzling and mesmerizing to watch . What a cozy a wonderful story ! I fell in love with this movie . If you have a chance , rent this and watch it ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Denis Leary can indeed be funny and clever at times and is always likable , but this takes the cake ! This show showed Leary 's genius.The Job is set in New York . Leary plays Mike McNeil , a hard-nosed detective who is married , has a occasional drug problem , and has a girlfriend . McNeil has serious attitude . So much he 's dripping in it . The precinct is filled with funny , interesting and likable characters besides McNeil . An excellent cast too . All of the episodes in this show are really funny and are addictive . The one liners in this show are everywhere . You 'll be in stitches after hearing them and still laugh about them a few minutes after and then some . The cases the precinct deals with are something else to stripper nuns , a bathroom hostage situation , and more are over the top . This show was too good . Could have grown legs to last many more seasons . The Last Word : A great , fantastic show . I miss this show dearly . All episodes of this show are great . You get even belly-laughs ... a lot . ABC made a huge mistake by giving this the ax . Too bad Leary did not revive the show for cable TV . Still , I give this show one of my highest of recommendations . Truly a one of a kind show . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy ( Peter Coyote ) who 's living the perfect suburban middle class life when late one night the police suddenly bust into his home and arrest him for the murder of some guy 27 years ago.In his prison cell Coyote recounts to his wife the fateful events of 27 years ago and how he came into contact with Wayne Kennedy the man who he supposedly killed.From here the story is told in flashback fashion and the more you learn about Wayne and Coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they did the more interested you get.The acting isn 't anything to crow about , although the guy who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty creepy enough . The real strong point of the movie is that mystery of what actually happened on the mountain . The wife spends the movie running around digging up clues to the mystery and each time something new comes up we are treated with another flashback revealing more of the mystery . It 's actually pretty well.So as far as Lifetime TV movie 's go this little flick comes highly recommended.Enjoy ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Watching " " Plots with a View " " ( called " " Undertaking Betty " " in the US ) , I got the feeling that there need to be more movies filmed in Wales . This one portrays a woman ( Brenda Blethyn ) in a small Welsh town trying to get away from her cheating husband . So , she and the funeral parlor manager ( Alfred Molina ) come up with a plan ... but there are likely to be some glitches along the way.I would actually say that Christopher Walken 's character is the neatest in the movie ( how could he not be ? ) . But overall , the whole idea is just a really neat one , stacked with some " " uh oh " " moments ... especially the haunted house scene . It 's the sort of movie that I wish that I could enter , just to experience it.Also starring Lee Evans , Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The first time I saw the poster , I was stunned by its tranquility and beauty . Then the city of Istanbul has been haunting in my mind ever since.Not much dialogue , not much music , the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture . It itself is a landscape.Actually there are a lot of things going on in the film , but the director deliberately omitted most dramatic parts and leave them to our imagination , thus creating a really flat life . * * ( mild spoiler ) One can see Mahmut 's ladylove crying in the toilet and then going out without a word but not their fight ; one can see Mahmut accompanying his mother in the hospital but not her struggle from illness . The most dramatic scene in the film to me is Yusuf laughing out loud for the toy soldier he bought for his niece , * * and that 's when it almost broke my heart to see this boring , lonely life bursting out in such a way.With all the trivialities in life weeded , the story presents us with pure inner world of all the characters , their sadness , anxiety , loneliness , regrets ... And as the story unfolded , I sort of finally grasped their desperate situation where their emotions were really no way out if no outer things intervened , which is exactly every loner tries to keep at all cost , especially for an irresponsible artist like Mahmut.I 've just finished my second watching . Last night , I crouched into my quilt , had some Vodka beside my bed and went through the whole film in a trance . I felt two real lives going on , one outside the screen , one inside the screen . I felt free from all those loneliness and anxiety ' cause the people inside were experiencing it . I just had myself removed from all those things.We cannot deny the universal problem of communication , and loneliness even puts us far towards it , and it becomes a vicious spiral . I bet Mahmut still didn 't figure out a way of living in the end . That 's why he stepped out of his room to try to find the answers from the outer world , the coldness and landscape . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It really is a great film ( after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny ) . Julie is , as usual , wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly . I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema in the Haymarket , London on its release . However Julie 's non-appearance at the UK premiere of STAR ! was most unfortunate and ( apparently ! ) due to filming the aerial shots for Darling Lili over Ireland . A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not . Two box office flops in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years .

" While Hayao Miyazaki 's movies have always been hit-or-miss with me with regards to story , they are unequivocally gorgeous to the eye , with characters of simple animation against a backdrop of artistic images . Ponyo sticks to that formula , with a lead character so adorable I want a plush doll of her and scenery so pretty it wouldn 't look out of place framed up as a picture on a wall.The story , on the other hand , I didn 't enjoy quite as much as his last two wide-releases , Spirited Away and Howl 's Moving Castle . It was just a tad too juvenile , coming across as more for kids and leaving adults to just enjoy the animation.I was also disappointed that the score done by Joe Hisaishi , who also the scores for the above-mentioned two movies , wasn 't nearly as memorable this time around . While I can 't quite recall Howl 's score now , I still remember it being one of the most beautiful I had ever heard . Ditto Spirited 's - though I only remember it being very complementary to the movie . Maybe it 's because Ponyo is more juvenile fare that the score isn 't quite as haunting . In any case , this movie is still a must-watch for fans of anime or Miyazaki . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I guess Melville intended this movie to be the definition of the cool ; it has the cool approach of the late ' 60s / early ' 70s thrillers혰the same discrete quirkiness . LE CERCLE ROUGE , a bitter and fatalist story , is also the playground of Delon , Bourvil , Volont챕 and Montand in defining roles.Bourvil is a cop who has in his flat three cats and a daily routine . Delon is a hoodlum . Montand is a sick , failed cop . Volont챕 plays an escaped suspect . LE CERCLE ROUGE is of course far above a heist movie ; Melville uses his techniques 혯long wordless detailed depictions of every step of the heist , etc .. Yet this particular action drama is far better than his other movies혰and it 's very unlikely them by being so much better . The look of LE CERCLE ROUGE is very peculiar to Melville , very Melvillian.Delon was sharp and cool ; Bourvil brings his craft , and Montand makes maybe the finest role of this movie ; his performance has an unexpected warmth .On the other hand , the characters are barely sketched , no more than strictly necessary , and are personae . Or masks ; yet the portrayal is inspired , economic but suggestive.Another of the movies that prove Delon to be a good , a very good actor ; and the fact that he 's not a genius does not imply that he ought to be despised as a fourth rate actor . He 's good , he can bear the proximity of a Bourvil and Montand.Only ten yrs. before LE CERCLE ROUGE , Melville was doing , towards the end of the ' 50s , a boring overlong insipid noir pastiche ( starring himself ) 혰and after only a decade , here he is , in full form , with this quite amazing action drama . Stylistically , it 's a success.Before seeing LE CERCLE ROUGE , I was not a Melvillian fan ; now I guess I rather am one.LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama혰namely , an action drama , one of the most exigent genres .

" For the life of me , why did this film receive an R rating ? ! While it IS about flesh-eating zombies , believe it or not , it 's actually a pretty good family-friendly film--at least if your kids are age 10 and older . Unlike the traditional zombie films , this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values--albeit a bit twisted ! The language isn 't a serious problem , there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids ( much like the old TV show " " Eerie , Indiana " " ) --yet some knucklehead slapped an R rating one it ! Believe me , most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film.The story is set in a parallel-type world . While the fashions , cars and mores appear circa 1953 , in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the " " zombie war " " and massive changes in everyday life . At school , kids are trained in armed combat and there 's a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack " " just in case " " ! As for life outside of school , it 's pretty weird as well , as people now have learned that zombies AREN 'T such a bad thing ! Heck , using shock collars and training , they can be made into slaves who can do your housework , clean streets , deliver milk or , in the case of a really sick guy , be your " " special friend " . " This film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave ( played by Billy Connally ) . Mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie 's friend . Dad , on the other hand , isn 't convinced--as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasn 't yet gotten over this ! !

" Following the release of Cube 2 : Hypercube ( 2003 ) , and playing off the alleged success of the original Cube ( 1998 ) , Director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy , the prequel Cube Zero.Deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution , time and place unknown , two low-ranking operators , Wynn ( Zachary Bennett ) and Dodd ( David Huband ) sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers , some of which are rigged with death traps . Told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection , these observers have had no problem with their jobs until Wynn , a mathematical genius , discovers that one of the prisoners , a woman named Cassandra ( Stephanie Moore ) never agreed to be put inside the Cube . Suddenly it 's realized that perhaps their " " jobs " " are not what they seem , and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted ... For people that have seen and enjoyed the original Cube , this prequel will probably not be to your liking . It 's not that the story does not have potential ; it 's simply that the first Cube film never needed to be expanded on . Standing alone , it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message . It was also nicely self-contained . The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original , attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing.What this new film has to offer , which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil , certainly are good questions to be raised , but probably should have been done so on their own merits , rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations.Having said this , the other traits of the film , such as acting and direction and writing , are not awful . There is a bleak , dark look to the film akin to such film noir as ' The Matrix ' and ' Dark City ' , and they have certainly managed to recapture the claustrophobic feeling of the first Cube . Unfortunately for Barbarash , these are not enough positive qualities to save it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just saw this movie tonight ( 5th Nov. 2005 ) for the first time . I wanted to watch it cause I saw the basketball diaries ( Leonardo Di Caprio ) and loved that but this was far more heavy going . I think it had a good depiction of drugs to an extent . I empathize mostly with Nick Stahls character , probably because if I someone I was crazy about was on that stuff I 'd want to help them get off it . A promising student and athlete who spends all his time training and studying-well it 's understandable that he 'd want to try teenage life ( the crazy side of it ) and in his efforts as what begins is helping his friend he ends up addicted because he wanted to see what it is all about and because of his horrendous family situation which results in his most tragic death . A truly sad film but one flaw i noticed is that you don 't get a good enough insight into the damage it does to families but apart from that , excellent performances on a truly heartbreaking movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I won 't try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting . At his best he turns in such oddball performances , insinuating so many things at once , that it doesn 't seem he does anything so much as play by unfailing instinct . Often it seems he is calling attention to some favored aspect of his character over all others , a concentration which , if followed , turns out something of a red herring , as he turns out subtler , craftier than at first appeared . This is a mastery of artifice , not naturalism , as might be associated with the Method . The role of Sky Masterson , as Mankiewicz so wonderfully realized , seems tailored for him , which is to begin with odd , and odd still at the end , because whatever it is Brando has done , he has managed a grace maybe all his own , but a consummate grace nonetheless -- again , odd , coming from an actor with limited musical ability , not ever before or after associated with the musical comedy . Jean Simmons , also oddly cast , is not quite as impressive , but certainly above just-adequate , really delightful in the Havana sequence , and never less than enjoyable throughout . And yet ... perhaps because actors are both so concentrated on what it is they are doing , and characters on what it is they intend of each other , there doesn 't seem to be the lovers ' " " chemistry " " brought up so insistently more than once . Brando / Sky Masterson and Simmons / Sister Sarah respectively feed off one another well enough , but I for one don 't see more beyond that . In a movie this outrightly dazzling and entertaining ( and most everything about it , craft-wise , is just that -- dazzling ) , that lack would seem something tactfully and easily overlooked , but so much would depend upon true chemistry ! An , at least partial , transformation of the characters through such chemistry , would lend something positively moving to the final scene . As it is , one leaves this film certainly delighted , but not really moved , except in a way as to negate the trueness of the union . Note Sister Sarah marries in her missionary 's uniform , Sky Masterson in his same natty man-about-town duds rather than wedding tux . And they have changed back to those from their previous scene ! Funnily enough ( that is , insightfully ) , the most touching , and most serious , scene is , I think , between Brando and Vivian Blaine , as Sinatra / Nathan Detroit 's doll , Adelaide , the only scene where these two are exclusively together , not least because there is just no hint of flirtation between them even though it takes place in Adelaide 's dressing-room while Adelaide is about to change . Though one may submit there is no place for that , Sky really is the type to " " check out " " Adelaide in this sort of circumstance . He is even there to tell Adelaide Nathan will not be meeting her to elope . Adelaide and Sky are both true in their respective ways to Nathan , even piteous of him , as is demonstrated through a tone in their exchange . Adelaide is of course also frustrated and disappointed , but her anger is mitigated by her deeper feeling for Nathan , as Sky is admonishing her that she can 't love a man and then wish him to be someone else.Guys and Dolls is another turn at the battle of the sexes , around the themes of gambling and salvation . Since both the compulsive gambler and the salvation seeker are more or less unconsciously courting despair , there just may be a dark secret deliberately behind Brando 's and Simmons ' lack of chemistry . After all , that lack may well denote an excess of narcissistic preoccupation ( echoed by the Sinatra / Blaine pairing , though with considerably less self-deception involved ) , which might explain Brando 's and Simmons ' odd , rather provoking , interpretations of Sky Masterson and Sister Sarah . I realize Simmons may be mostly depicting coldness and skepticism , but Brando , though playing to confront her , isn 't exactly heated and eager , and is more than keeping his distance -- he 's also assimilating it , keeping his balance through it . His boldness consists in merely playing against her -- the trip to Cuba , a kiss , whatever it takes -- but he is not actually set on winning through seducing her so much as beating her then in her own turf . This may be shrewd , as playing to zeal may be the only way to get to the missionary , and through . But it makes Sky 's transition from merely trying to win a bet to actually wanting Sarah Brown a little less than persuasive . Yet why does he want her ? What does falling in love mean to Sky ? I find the only way to get around this is by indeed accepting his humanity has kicked in , and that he does not want to end up a mere cad toward Sister Sarah , so he does , as he 's promised her , need to deliver the sinners to her prayer meeting , make good by his " " marker , " " as he puts it , as a way of winning her back when it seems he had already won only to lose her . But this still denotes self-concern more than anything . However , it also allows for Sarah Brown 's own self-concern , as Sky will placate the missionary in her in order to get back the lover . Neither , at least it seems , will change much by their union , except perhaps in the acceptance of the other . Yet that would seem an all but fatally uneasy proposition : acceptance of is still quite a cry away from achieving happiness in the other , let alone the transcendence they each seem to imply by " " chemistry . " " And behind all this , I suspect is Mankiewicz 's full knowing.For all those who might say , in defense of Guys and Dolls yet , that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth , I need only remind them Cabaret , The Three-penny Opera , Carousel , A Star is Born , even The Sound of Music , which I don 't care for as much ( and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post-Cabaret musicals ) , all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire anxieties . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A most recommendable masterpiece , not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of Angelopoulos , not to mention the acting of giants , Mastroianni and Moreau , and the remarkable character play by Ilias Logothethis . Gregory Karr 's performance may seem overshadowed by his " " tough " " partners ' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character , which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl ( Khrysikou ) and the man ( Mastroianni ) , albeit hinted beforehand . ( Hence the spoiler . ) Get your expectations straight ! It 's an " " art movie " " in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention . Not for spending free time , but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert . Due to the overall photographic style , large screen viewing is recommended.Dialogues are used sparingly .

Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both give quite good performances here . Beckinsales performance was a little weak though .

" I saw Marigold at a preview showing a few days ago , and found it to be a thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable film . The film is about a not-so-successful American actress who goes to India to act in a low budget film , only to find herself stranded there when she finds on arrival that the film 's financing has vanished , along with the producers and investors . A chance encounter with an Indian film shooting nearby leads her to be hired for a small dancer role in that . Since Indian films incorporate a significant amount of singing and dancing , this is a problem for Marigold , who has two left feet , not to mention a personality so tightly wound-up and thorny that she can hardly hear the music , let alone feel it , as Prem , the choreographer of the film , advices her to do.But " " prem " " -- the word , not the person -- means " " love " , " and Prem -- the person , not the word -- seems to embody that emotion in the way he deals with all around him , whether it be his production assistant friends who introduced Marigold to the shoot , the narcissistic and arrogant leads of the film , or the bitchy and uptight Marigold herself . Soon , under his expert tutelage and endearing treatment , Marigold finds her feet -- literally and figuratively.I must say a word for those not familiar with the use of song and dance in Indian films . Unlike American musicals , the story progresses through these dance numbers , as plot developments unfold , and character transformations occur in parallel with the dancing . It should also be pointed out that Indian dance is about a lot more than mere movement . An essential part of it is the enactment of the dancer 's feelings and emotions while telling the story of the dance . This is the main purpose of the dance and the dancer.That Marigold reaches this stage of accomplishment is demonstrated in a stunning dance number about midway through , when Marigold , while performing the dance she is required to do for the film-within-the-film , also expresses her love for Prem . It is an amazing performance by Ali Larter , especially when one considers that she is not used to dancing in her films , or emoting her character 's feelings via dance . It shows her skill as an actress , as well as how much hard work she has put into the role.Of course no romantic film can work without a credible Prince Charming . Salman Khan , who plays the role of Prem , fits the role to a T. Even when it turns out that he is a Prince not so charming , he does not lose the audience 's sympathy . Salman has been ruling Hindi cinema ( sometimes called Bollywood ) for many years now , and it is worth remembering that his first leading role was also as Prem . He is completely charming , sweet , adorable , sexy , and vulnerable . For those who have never encountered him on screen before , be prepared to be hit with mega doses of sheer magnetism ! He and Ali Larter make a lovely pair , and are as well matched in their acting as in their appearance.Will they manage to work out their problems ? It doesn 't seem possible as we hear the last song of the film , a lovely blending of fact and fantasy , reality and metaphor . The ending certainly took some of the audience I saw it with by surprise , but they were left satisfied . The songs are used very cleverly . They are in Hindi , unsubtitled , for the film-within-the-film sequences , and in English for other occasions . But their meaning is always clear from the context and choreography.Marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy -- yes , there is quite a bit of humor as well in it . The Indian locations and costumes give it a fairy tale quality , befitting a story which can be likened to a modern fairy tale.If you are or have been curious about Indian cinema , but were hesitant to try it , this is an excellent introduction . It captures the color and vibrancy of Indian films , not only in the costumes and jewelry ( which are quite impressive ) , but also in the lively dances and world sound music.If you are a fan of Ali Larter , you should watch it for her excellent acting in portraying a selfish , demanding , " " high-maintanance " " woman who nevertheless has an inner attraction that inspires the love of two men . If you are a girl , you will enjoy admiring Ali 's lovely costumes and ogling her hunk of a leading man . If you are a guy , you can not only admire Ali in her sexy costumes , but learn from Salman Khan what it takes to bring out the loving heart even from someone as edgy as Marigold . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Pre-adolescent humor is present in large quantities . The acting and story are wonderful if you can stomach the concept . Those with weak constitutions will have some difficulty since the " " worms " " are realistic enough to cause churning of more than a few in the audience.Tom Cavanagh and Hallie Kate Eisenberg stole the spotlight , but the young Ty Panitz could get some serious time on screen over the next few years.Miss Eisenberg has developed from a cute face into a strong young actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery . The story does a spectacular job in dealing with bullying , friendship , and fairness . It creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open and frank manner while recalling some " " gross " " scene from the film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways , it 's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959 . Like this later film , both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it 's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry ( though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway ) .The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work . She 's assigned to tough-as-nails boss , Joan Crawford , who is appearing in her first supporting role in decades . Despite how nasty Crawford seems , Lange is determined not to give in--to make it in this job . And , over time , she quickly moves up the ranks from secretary to editor . At the same time , her two new roommates also try to move up the ranks--one through the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy . Like VALLEY OF THE DOLLS , all of them have their ups and downs ( mostly downs ) but by the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will make it--battered and bruised , nevertheless.In this film , men are mostly pigs . The only guy who seems decent is played by Stephen Boyd , so naturally Hope Lange neglects him for a ne 'er do well ex-boyfriend . As for the guys played by veteran character actor Brian Ahern and the rest , they are sexist scum and eventually you understand how Crawford became so bitter and nasty.This film has it all--adultery , premarital sex , abortion , etc. and is certainly NOT an artistic triumph . However , thanks to excellent production values and a juicy script , this one is a joy to watch . Just don 't expect Shakespeare ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow , I loved this movie , this film was filled with plot twists , good acting , great story , and a surprising ending . To be completely honest this movie wasn 't overly gory , it does contain some gore , though , but was more on the psychological side . I read it on the Internet : the film cost 3000 dollars and was shoot in 8 days . Amazing ! ! ! This is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making . What starts out as a terrorizing thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted , even a bit more sinister . Not much I can say without giving away plot points only that this movie went beyond my expectations , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film , but this is not true . I did enjoy the movie , but was probably expecting too much.Adele , who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon , did not come off as a very likable character . She is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter . This is the one thing she knows how to do without fail . Adele 's daughter , Anna , is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother 's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old . This , of course , makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna since she never seems to be 14- 17 years old either . Portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years . Yet , even with the two solid leads , Wayne Wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and even more so with Smoke . Though I have not read the book , the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen , changes which may drain the emotional pungency of the story . I enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work , but I never got lost in the experience and I never related to their plight . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This one of the best and funniest comedy series i have ever seen ! All characters are brilliant.Mr. Slatt ( David Bamber ) is a very very irritated man , irritated by everything and anyone.He wants to do things and handle situations as best as he possibly can , but he never gets it right and only gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble . Not supported by his wife Janet , who only tries to get him deeper and deeper into the trouble he is getting himself into ( and really does not need the help at all ! ) .All characters are played / portrayed brilliantly . Just imagine sending your kid ( s ) to a school like this.It is unbelievable that people do not like it ( maybe some don not get the many many plays on words , that are featured many times per episode ) .It is also unbelievable that there is still no DVD release of it . There are only 2 series ! So please , release it , let it go ! So the fans can and will enjoy it ! Try it , you might just like it ! ! !

" This is where the term " " classic film " " comes from . This is a wonderful story of a woman 's bravery , courage and extreme loyalty . Poor Olan got sold to her uncaring husband , who through the years learned to appreciate her . ( Yeah right , A PEARL ! ! ) Luise Rainer was the beautiful star who had won the Best Actress Oscar the year before for her small role ( and what a waste of an oscar ) in " " The Great Zigfield " . " It really didn 't show what , if any , talent she had other than her exotic beauty . But in " " Good Earth " " she shows that she can really act ! Her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either . People say that she didn 't show any real emotions in this film . Like hell . Her character Olan is a shy and timid woman , with inner strength . She is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions . Example : those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot . If you people are saying that she doesn 't act well in this film , you are NOT looking ! Paul Muni shows that he can act as well . His character is not a likeable one to me . He never sees her for what she is , until the very end of the story . A sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother , with her own special beauty . The greatest one of all , the beauty from within , like a pearl.If you get a chance to see this film , watch it . You will see one of the best films that the golden age of Hollywood created . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I can 't stand people who comment on this program or other HBO programs as " " too graphic " " or " " unnecessarily graphic " " or that they contain " " gratuitous nudity / violence / sodomy etc " .

If you don 't like it , then don 't watch the program . I 'm certainly no fan of prison rape , but if it was left out of the show I 'd be surprised and lend the show less credibility .

" I love this movie . As a kid , this was one of the first movies I saw that made me flinch . Sure , it is mild now , but back in the day , it was awesome .

And I have always had a love for medical horror . And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feinstone perfectly , no one could have done it better . And for a low budget horror film , the effects and such are quite good . And I also love the theme music , it goes well with the film .

" Director / writer Andr챕s Waissbluth worked seven years to complete this two hour film about the crime underground in Santiago , Chile , and perhaps that is one of the reasons the resultant film seems episodic and in need of editing . OR , maybe this is the technique of a director who shows a fine sense of film noir storytelling.Two brothers - Silvio the elder ( N챕stor Cantillana ) and Victor the younger ( Juan Pablo Miranda ) - have moved to Santiago from their home in Temuco after their parents ' death and Silvio works to support Victor 's education . On Victor 's seventeenth birthday Silvio takes the virgin out to the clubs where he encourages Victor to lose his virginity with one of the club 's stripper / prostitutes . In a tender scene Victor must face his nascent impotency while Silvio is out on the club floor impressing the ' owners ' with his potential for hire.Silvio goes to work for the ' gang ' as a bodyguard / henchman and makes good money to support Victor 's schooling . But Victor has eyes for one of the dancers at the club named Gracia ( Antonella R챠os ) and begins to woo her , dropping out of school incurring Silvio 's angry disappointment . Gracia just happens to be the squeeze of the club gang 's leader Don Pascual ( Alejandro Trejo ) who is Silvio 's boss ! Gracia is the glue that holds this tale together as she is the paramour of Victor , Silvio , and Don Pascual and the consequences of this bizarre m챕nage a trois has deadly results . Through a means of re-telling the story through the eyes of Victor , Silvio , and Gracia we grow to understand the vulnerabilities and the cracks in each character that allow for the downfall that results.Sound like a Chilean Pulp Fiction ? Well , it is and it is filmed in a brutally colorful , dark manner that includes a lot of frontal nudity ( both female and male ) and provocative sexual encounters . But in the end the sensual aspect of the director 's vision is what drives this film , playing on the debutante virginal psyche against the hardcore professional sex worker with success . The cast is fairly strong , especially Antonella R챠os in the demanding role of Gracia . There are enough twists and turns and replays of incidents you think you understood the first viewing but that change dramatically in impact when told through the eyes of a different character . Bordering on two hours , some judicious editing would have helped the impact of the film . In Spanish with English subtitles . Recommended for those who like the edgy film noir style and the art of South American cinema . Grady Harp , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Released as KING BOXER in the U.K.This film was essentially the FIRST kung fu film to go on general release in the U.K. Many of us had ratcheted through Kurosawa 's astonishingly gritty and involving dramas and were used to oriental film being beautifully shot and lit , with somewhat restrained pacing , all in all like leafing through an album of very fine still photographs that just happened to be moving.Along come Run Run Shaw and co. with their widescreen " " home movie " " production values , and astonishing ripe-for-parody dubbing and all the rules have changed . KIng Boxer was the first in through the door , leaving a clearly marked trail for others to follow with their feet planted firmly on top of the blazed footsteps.In spite of hokey plots , pantomime acting , cheesy jump-cuts and spaghetti western style snap-stepped zooms , this film was marvellous . Gorgeous without being opulent and with the most brilliant fight choreography ever to grace a screen . We loved the sickening violence , the anguish , the testosterone . The martial artists among us found some of the techniques fascinating , if flamboyant and oftentimes silly . It was so very different from the Japanese stuff we all knew , and it had lovely acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the sickening violence and bloodstained floors . Delightful.The " " KIng Lear " " scene was , at the time , quite a milestone in schlock " " You cruel bastards .. My * * * * ! ! " " Now it 's rather less shocking , but still a bit of a gut-churnerWe didn 't notice that any females in sight were absolutely one-dimensional . After seeing more films of the genre , it now stands out like a sore thumb , but at the time it didn 't matterThis film defined what would rapidly become the kung-fu movie clich챕s . All of them . Watch it and remember that until this burst onto the western screens , there was no genre for it to slot into . It was unique and awesome . It was the first kung fu movie and it still is , for me and many others , the best . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I felt compelled to comment on this film because it 's listed as the fourth lowest-rated sci-film of all time on the IMDb . WHAT ! ? ! ? Sure , this movie is crappy , but it 's HILARIOUS ! It 's not awful on an Ed Wood level , it 's more surreal and uneven.There are some classic moments in the film . The brain surgery is gross and great- and even nuttier when you consider that the film was rated PG ! Gor chasing after his dolly before getting battery acid dumped on his face- " " Mine ! Gimmee ! " " Zandor Vorkoff 's speeches at the beginning of the film- " " Before Amir , Kali was but another weak nation struggling to break free from centuries of stagnant feudalism ! " " Angelo Rossito also has some great lines- " " No , Gor ! No ! " " " " You want these keys , don 't you , my pretties ? " " It is absolutely wrong that this is the 4th lowest-rated sci-film on the IMDb because it is ENTERTAINING . No matter how bad a film is , if it still manages to be weird , quirky , unsettling , or entertaining , it has merit and doesn 't deserve to be dumped on and dismissed . I won 't defend most of Al Adamson 's films , but this one , along with Dracula VS . FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR , are entertaining enough to make up for their awfulness . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I didn 't know a lot about this film going into it but I did find out that Kane was a wrestler , which didn 't exactly thrill me but hey , I liked " " Santa 's Slay " " and that had a wrestler in it , so what the hell . The story begins very strangely and promisingly but after a while becomes not much more than your typical teen terror slasher flick , although the settings helped some . A bunch of criminal young folks get rounded up and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace but is now a dump , to clean it up to prepare it as a homeless shelter . The driver is a man with a prosthetic arm , being a veteran of the opening scene of this movie wherein he encounters this big galoot that had just killed his partner and blinded another woman . The teens , all being punk smart-asses , all of course object to having to do any real work , but they 're part of some unique co-ed work program , yep , what a great idea that is , of course . Little does anyone suspect that there is someone lurking there in the hotel that in his own little way will save the tax payers of that state some money . Of course , it 's the guy that likes to collect eyeballs , and he 's got quite a collection going . There won 't be a lot here that horror fans haven 't seen before but there 's a few brutal scenes and sufficient gore to satisfy the hard-core fan . The setting of the old hotel makes a perfect spot for a slasher flick too , and there 's little sub-stories , like the search for an alleged safe full of money and the search for babes , since this co-ed work crew is evenly matched . Most of the teens are deservingly killable too so that works well . Not great but far better than Silent Hill or When A Stranger calls , and perhaps better than some of the other crap that I wouldn 't bother to see . 7 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal . The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal , dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space . Therefore , anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed ; it is not intended to be " " realistic . " " It is , however , intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail . In addition , the symbolic representations are left open for interpretation , which can be said of much great artwork . Don 't be fooled by the cover ( if you happen to rent or buy this film ) -- the movie is not what it might seem to be on the surface . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is an amazing film , both for the incredibly energy evoked from the frenetic flamenco dancing , and from the unique way that the filmmakers interweave the story of the stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it . Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe the experience . This is not ' Bizet 's Carmen ' by any usual standard . This is not a usual film by any standard . Every nuanced glance , every stomp of the foot , every piece of the music is intertwined so captivatingly that you can 't take your eyes off the screen . You don 't need to love opera or flamenco ( I don 't ) to be captured , enraptured , enthralled by this film . Subtle and direct ; loud and still ; One of , if not the best , movies of it 's kind , because there are so few like it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Remember Ralph Bakshi ? The guy that was an animator on Terrytoons , then on Paramount Cartoon Studios , after that , he was a director on Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic ? Well , this is Coonskin . And it 's actually pretty good . Racist , but good . The movie takes place in Harlem Nights ( No , duh , it was a working title . ) but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a Disney movie , Song of the South.It 's about Sampson ( Barry White ) and the Preacherman ( Charles Gordone ) rush to help their friend , Randy ( Philip Michael Thomas ) escape from prison , but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police . While waiting for them , Randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee Pappy ( Scatman Crothers ) , as he begins to tell Randy a story about " " three guys , I used to know , just like you and your friends " . " Pappy 's story is told in animation set against live-action background photos and footage.Brother Rabbit ( voice of Thomas ) , Brother Bear ( voice of White ) , and Preacher Fox ( voice of Gordone ) decide to pack up and leave their Southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel . Arriving in Harlem , Rabbit , Bear , and Fox find that it isn 't all that it 's made out to be . They encounter a con man named Simple Savior , a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the " " cousin " " of Black Jesus , and that he gives his followers " " the strength to kill whites " . " In a flashy stage performance in his " " church " , " Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression혰represented by images of John Wayne , Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon , before asking his parishioners for " " donations " . " Rabbit first goes up against Madigan , a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and the bag man for the Mafia , who demonstrates his contempt for African Americans in various ways , including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them ( he believes they 're not worth it ) . When Madigan finds out that Rabbit has been taking his payoffs , he and his cohorts , Ruby and Bobby , are led to a nightclub called " " The Cottontail " . " A black stripper distracts him while an LSD sugar cube is dropped into his drink . Madigan , while under the influence of his spiked drink , is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man , and then shoved into clothes that women were representative of the racist archetype , adorned in something racist , and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead.Then , while recovering from his delirium of being drugged , shoots his gun around randomly , and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them.Rabbit , Bear , Fox and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up . The live-action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaping while being shot at by various white cops , but managing to make it out alive.This movie was controversial at that time of release , and was re-edited by the director several times under the title , Street Fight , which is obvious , since Street Fight is a 2005 documentary about racism in the streets . In fact , this movie has the same subject as the documentary.That caused Bryanston Pictures , the distributor of this film and the original Tobe Hopper classic , Texas Chainsaw Massacre , to go out of business . Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film , but due to racism , Bryanston took over Bakshi 's production.Despite the controversy , it was worth the entertainment . The animation was awesome at that time , the plot makes sense , and it 's actually funny too.FINAL VERDICT : 9 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Some people say this is the best film that PRC ever released , I 'm not too sure about that since I have a fond place in my heart for some of their mysteries . I will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they , or any other studio , major or minor , ever released.The plot is simple . The ghost of a wrongly executed ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him as well as all of their off spring . Into this mix comes the granddaughter of one ghosts victims , the current ferryman . She takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in on the man she loves.Shrouded in dense fog and set primarily on the single swamp set this is more musical poem than regular feature film.Listen to the rhythms of the dialog , especially in the early scenes , their is poetical cadence to them . Likewise there is a similar cadence to the camera work as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door way between life and death , innocence and guilt . The film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object lesson more than a normal horror film . Its an amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film history.This isn 't to guild the Lilly . This is a low budget horror / mystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained . Its tale of love and revenge is what matters here , not the poetical film making and it holds you attention first and foremost ( the technical aspects just being window dressing . ) If there is any real flaw its the cheapness of the production . The fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land . The constant back and forth across it is okay for a while but even after 58 minutes you do wish that we could see something else.Don 't get me wrong I do like the film a great deal . Its a good little film that I some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken . Its definitely worth a look if you can come across it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really liked this film when it was released , and I still do , because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general , and people too ... one of the things I like about the films of Lawrence Kasdan . In addition to the positive vibes from the film , there are other reasons to like Grand Canyon . For one thing , it has an outstanding cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover , for example . In my opinion , Crash , the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture , was very similar to this film . The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive . Crash had the opposite effect with me ; it was very dark . I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash any day . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sure , he became rapidly uneven after this film , but from " " Knife In the Water " " up till " " The Tenant " , " Roman Polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique . Despite many running themes ( alienation , paranoia ) , no two of his films are really alike . The story of this is somewhat similar to his own " " Repulsion " " from ten years earlier , but the tone is completely different . " " The Tenant " " manages to balance darker than dark absurdity ( I 'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor , even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny ) with some truly suspenseful paranoia . Polanski was always a master at building unease , and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy . The overall weirdness of the film is also a plus.In addition to Polanski 's exquisite as usual direction , the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions . Polanski the actor is often overshadowed by Polanski the director , but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast . The themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange . The rest of the cast offers strong performances also , especially Isabelle Adjani 's sympathetic turn , and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters ' appropriately annoying ones . " " The Tenant " " is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both " " Repulsion " " and " " Rosemary 's Baby " , " but its just as brilliant as either of those classics .

" It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing : sex . Don 't get me wrong , I 'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all I 'm interested in is highly offensive . Take The Convenant , a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and / or a script that wasn 't written by a six year old . This is essentially The Craft with ( supposedly ) hot guys . And , yeah , that 's it . It bored me to tears . Even my friend , who usually laps us crap films , hated it . It is really stunningly bad , to the extent where it can actually be funny . I would have laughed if it wasn 't for the fact that several other females in cinema attendance seemed to be enjoying it . They were accompanied by several shifty looking guys who positively curled up and died when the ( really clich챕 ) boy on boy kiss happened towards the end . Watching them squirm really was the highlight of the film . I don 't think mainstream , Hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers ( or , indeed , for anyone ) so I think I 'll give up . Unless you 're a teen who likes The Pussycat Dolls , thinks Paris Hilton is " " hot " " and watches MTV it 's like some sort of wasteland .

" Wallace and Gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted . The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes " " A Grand Day Out , " " " " The Wrong Trousers , " " and also " " A Close Shave " " some of the best animated footage ever put on television . Winning several Oscars and also countless other awards , Nick Park became quite the popular man in the U.K. , yet his impact on the United States has not been big . After the third Wallace and Gromit short , there was all this speculation about a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie , yet for years nothing had happened . Then in 2000 instead of a full-length Wallace and Gromit film , we get another brilliant claymation film from Nick Park , which was Chicken Run , which almost got nominated for best picture in the Academy Awards . Perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project.5 years later ( these kinds of films do take long you know ) and a lot of anticipation , Wallace and Gromit finally hits the big screen . Despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign , this movie delivers in so many ways . This film will be a delight for both kids and parents . With tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation , Wallace and Gromit : Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults . This rather difficult technique is one that only Pixar has already perfected and DreamWorks has had a lot of trouble doing lately . Despite the DreamWorks logo slapped onto the poster , this film is mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations.Wallace and Gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople 's crops from being ruined by rabbits , which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately . Their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection . Complications arise when Wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area . It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople . To add to that , Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington , which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of Victor . Simple plot yes , but there is more than meets the eye , be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way , kind of like in the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons.In animated films with little dialogue , it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film . Despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage , the payoff is fantastic . There is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice . Even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film . Whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible , or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film , most Curse of the Were-Rabbit 's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late . Just picture the movie Madagascar , except funnier much fewer pop culture references , and better animation.Casting was great , even though in a film with not much dialogue , it was not that important . Peter Sallis yet again does a wonderful job as Wallace , even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime ( The Wrong Trousers : " " It 's the wrong trousers Gromit , and they 've gone wrong ! " " ) . Ralph Fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter ( known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit " " Fight Club " " ) lends her lovely voice as she plays Wallace 's love interest . Even though nothing could top the final chase in " " The Wrong Trousers , " " Curse of the Ware-Rabbit did have plenty of action scenes , including one fantastically done chase scene between Gromit and Victor 's evil dog . Last but not least , the rabbits really steal the show at some moments . Whether it is their cute expressions , their funny movements , or their howling , the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars . The funniest rabbit in the movie is the " " cursed " " rabbit himself , to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter.Bottom Line : Despite not being as memorable as " " The Wrong Trousers " , " this film is just as good and entertaining as Chicken Run . Unlike almost every movie to come out this year , the movie does not drag at all , clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun , it will leave everyone watching it asking for more . There is very little wrong with the film ; it was a pure delight to watch . This film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar , uncut , raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year ( 40-Year-Old Virgin , Wedding Crashers , and Sin City ) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment ; that is a good thing . Highly recommend , this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade . Wallace and Gromit : Curse of the Were-Rabbit : totally harmless fun from second 1 to second 5,100 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Plunkett & Macleane falls into my favourite genre of film ( historical action adventure with comedy ) which is probably why I rate it so highly.The action centres around a highwayman ( Plunkett ) and a layabout ' gentleman ' who gets entangled with him and his schemes ( Macleane ) . This leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures which are all tinged with comedy . There is also , of course , a love interest.The rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant , larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the wealthy at this time.This is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I thought this was a beautiful movie- very brave . Such beautiful imagery-and I liked the use of breaking glasses w / applause . Also how the best friend repeated the line about " .. " and she 's one year older than me .. " " showed that their friendship has rekindled and grown , but maybe some competition is left ... i loved the footage of hands feeling the fabric . The dance concert was beautiful . The beginning seemed slow , though .. it took awhile to feel for the characters-the husband could have been more abusive-he just seemed absent so when other characters talked about him-it didn 't really fit . The affair btwn. the best friend and husband seemed random .. the doctors meeting seemed to hint that there was not much time left ( to live .. ) so when the infidelity was revealed , I didn 't feel as much sympathy for the character-more like relief ! the ending was so great- the lines btwn. her and the husband , and the scene where she is pulled over is brilliant ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface and slightly altered biography . Dramatizes Richard 's discovery of " " We 've Only Just Begun " " and Karen 's marriage troubles admirably ( the " " Superstar " " montage was a nice touch ) , yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka , the contribution of Tony Peluso 's guitar solos , etc . Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona , but it doesn 't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter 's personality . Anderson is in fine form as the creative and take-charge Richard , and Fletcher makes her mark as the loving but overbearing Agnes . The most haunting moment of the original broadcast is the use of " " Goodbye to Love " " in the background of a commercial displaying an anorexia hotline . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" When I began watching I thought I was watching some pro-Koresh amateur documentary . However , I had never seen 3 / 4 of the footage they used . They interviewed people saying that the FBI / ATF instigated all these things , which sounded so far fetched , but then followed in up with FBI video and testimony . I was amazed . The documentary followed up with the senate investigation after the fire , and after seeing the interview and video footage you will be shocked at how the Senate and Attorney General turn their backs on Davidians basically to cover up the aggression by the FBI / ATF . If you start watching this you must finish it . Otherwise you will think it is propaganda of something like that . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago , admiring the bucolic architecture , when a woman , angrily arguing in French on a cell phone , passes by them , prompting James to remark , " " There 's nothing hotter than an angry French woman . " " A few blocks later , they pass an old Filipino woman , also angry , also arguing on a cell phone , and Luca remarks , for referential effect , " " There 's nothing hotter than an angry , elderly Filipino woman . " " The humor in Jeff Garlin 's I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is best characterized by the word quotidian . The film is a conversation . We might as well be eavesdropping . Rather than go for antics , the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughs . While it 's not innovative , it is far from banal , and even if James views himself as being rather jejune , we know that he is fairly average , and this endears him.Self-betterment is the primary theme of the movie . Sarah Silverman , who plays Beth , is excellent as the catalyst of change ; she revitalizes James , and so reminds him to live a better life . Even so , achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters , but rather something simpler : that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love , just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on.A movie about life lessons can be overwrought , as it can forget to connect with its audience . I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is subtle and winsome , and while its moral may not be inspiring , it is still resonant . This is low-key comedy , but it will stick with you . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If your idea of a thriller is car chases , explosions , and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire , then " " House of Games " " is definitely not the movie for you . If you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense , then , by all means , see it . " " House of Games " " tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer , Dr. Margaret Ford ( Lindsay Crouse ) , who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic Mike ( Joe Mantegna ) . To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense . Frankly , I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming . Just like a clever con artist , this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance.The story is taut and well-crafted , the dialogue smart and laconic , the acting uniformly good ( Mantegna is superbly charismatic ) . Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character , and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive . But Dr. Ford is supposed to be cold and aloof ; moreover , her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot ( at one point , I believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... I 'll say no more ) . " " House of Games " " is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity . It will hold your attention every second while you are watching , and stay with you for a long time afterwards . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this movie Sunday afternoon . I absolutely loved this movie . I loved everything about it , from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where Mamie Gummer ( Lila ) is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love . I loved these moments because they were just so real . At first I was seriously scared because I was hoping that it would not end up like Bobby , which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it . But during the middle of the movie i felt completely different . You will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see Evening one more time .

" Often laugh out loud , sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guys -- Lemmon a neurotic clean " " house husband " " and Matthau a slob sportswriter -- who decide to live together to cut down on expenses . Nicely photographed and directed . The script is very barbed -- that is , there 's always more than one side to almost every line . Particularly funny scene involves 2 british sisters ( Evans and Shelley ) who seem amused by everything anyone says , but when Lemmon busts out his photos of kids and , yes , ex-wife-to-be , he has the girls sobbing along with him before Matthau can show up with the promised drinks !

" Without doubt a great all round show that if shown today would attract a huge following.Bodyguards was only 6 episodes and a trailer , but deserved a few more series to really bring it up-to speed.With outstanding performances from the highly talented and versatile Sean Pertwee and the dynamic Louise Lombard , it really did put it up with the likes of the Proffesionals , The Sweeney and Thief Takers.The story lines are based on the Diplomatic Protection Services and with great filming and story lines and scene locations , it stood out from some of the junk that gets churned by other TV production companies.I do not think that it has been shown on terrestrial TV either , such as Sky or Freeview , witch is a shame as if it were to be shown nowadays , i am sure it would get a large viewing audience.So i hope one day the guys at Carlton TV decide to release it on DVD , cheers , Nick . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Forget everything that you have ever read about the Mallachi Brothers ' straight-to-video release " " Snakes on a Train , " " especially if it was a negative review . This movie is way more fun than the movie that it obviously rips off : " " Snakes on a Plane . " " Frankly , I am surprised that more people aren 't rhapsodizing about this low-budget Asylum Release . Instead , most reviews that I 've read have nothing kind or critically worthwhile to say except the usual stupid herd mentality idiocy , such as the acting was amateurish , the action didn 't numerically live up to the advertising , and the entire thing amounted to a hideous waste of time . Of course , it doesn 't help that the title is a tip-off to the obvious rip-off nature of this film . Actually , I felt that " " Snakes on a Train " " surpassed " " Snakes on a Plane " " for a number of reasons.First , the producers used real , genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they substituted either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a super-giant snake that consumed an entire Amtrak like train . How many movies have a snake gobble a train ? As a result , " " Snakes on a Train " " ranks as the first movie to scale that height.Second , this low-budget movie employs some grisly gross-out effects . The woman who coughs up baby snakes--real ones--was fantastic ! The special effects of her forearms getting tore up later in the movie were visually enticing ! Also , you get to see a little white girl get eaten alive by a snake . She was as cute as she could be , no more than 10 years old or thereabouts , and she died screaming all the way as nasty ol챕 giant mister snake head swallows her . Not only kids in jeopardy but kid eaten ! This is exactly the kind of graphic material that you won 't find in 99 % of all theatrical Hollywood releases . Of course , she wasn 't eaten by a real snake , but it 's the subversive thought that counts.Third , it is one of those cursed upon movies where Alma ( Julia Ruiz of " " That Guy " " ) , the chief female character--no heroine--has a curse placed on her by her parents because she didn 't marry the man that they recommended . As a result , she is filled with snakes , coughs up quantities of green radiator fluid slop then chucks up a baby snake . Imagine Medusa , the mythical characters that had snakes for hair , only with the snakes in her belly . Her psycho-shaman type boyfriend collects all the snakes that come out of her because they are heading to L.A. on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back inside of her and return her to normal . Talk about a whacked out character performing stomach churning routines . Prepare yourself for lots of slime , blood , and gore . Fourth , the train had only about twenty or so passengers , not hundreds . Nevertheless , it looked like the Mallachi Brothers filmed this above-average horror flick on-board a real train with real snakes and they played up the swaying motion of the train on the tracks.Fifth , the snakes slither around for the first hour , quietly infiltrating the train before they turn weird and attack everybody . In other words , it 's suspense , suspense , suspense , before people start dying from snake bites.Up until the last five minutes when the snake grows bigger than the runaway train and swallows it , " " Snakes on a Train " " is warped , wonderful , and way-out . It doesn 't have the Attention Deficit editing of a big league Hollywood movie . It 's a fantasy about an unfortunate Hispanic women victimized because of her feminist , at-odds-with-society attitude . Altogether , you 've got gory fantasy type stuff ; suspenseful snakes slithering around the train , and am over-the-top gigantic snake at the end . Incidentally , they get on board the train because a bunch of other Mexicans have bribed a train employee and the Mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend on free.I think it 's better than " " Snakes on a Plane " " if you want a tough , little , independently produced horror movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" An old vaudeville team of Willy Clark ( Walter Matthau ) and Al Lewis ( George Burns ) were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other . Over 20 years later they agree to get together for a TV special ... but find out they STILL hate each other . Willy 's nephew / agent ( Richard Benjamin ) tries to get them to work together.A big hit in its day and it won George Burns an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor . I ( somewhat ) liked it . It was written by Neil Simon so its non-stop one-liners . Some of it was funny but making jokes of Willy and Al 's senility was NOT . Also I never liked Matthau . I never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way . Also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly . All that aside this was fun . Burns is just great tossing off one-liners with ease and even Matthau was good matching him . Their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie . Also Benjamin is very good as Willy 's nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other . For me it 's worth seeing for Burns alone . This jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had ANOTHER hit with " " Oh God " . " So , this is good . Just good--not great . Matthau 's character really makes this hard to love . I give it a 7 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Some of the reviewers here have foolishly judged this silent film by political-correctness standards of today . " " Battle " " was an excellent film for several reasons , correctly noted by more rational reviewers : Superb cast , lots of action , innovative editing and photography . Its stars were in effect the D.W. Griffith stock company and to this silent movie fan , that is inducement enough to watch it and to enjoy it . I saw it many years ago and just watched it again at YouTube ; that was a very poor quality print , but coupled with my memory of a good print in a real theater , I can justifiably recommend this to reasonable people and film historians . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OK , so in any Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner cartoons , we know that WEC is going to set up all sorts of traps for RR , but always maim himself in various ways . That certainly happens in " " Beep , Beep " . " Predictable ? I guess that it is , but when you think about it , these cartoons show how the more you try to harm someone else , the more you get harmed ; sort of like how Daffy Duck always tries to undermine Bugs Bunny 's integrity but Bugs sees around it.Overall , this is another classic from the Termite Terrace crowd . Sometimes , I think that if we really had wanted to ease Cold War tensions , we could have just let the Soviet Union see Looney Tunes cartoons ; I 'm sure that they would have loved them .

" There are numerous films relating to WW2 , but Mother Night is quite distinctive among them : In this film , we are introduced to Howard Campbell ( Nolte ) , an American living in Berlin and married to a German , Helga Noth ( Lee ) , who decides to accept the role of a spy : More specifically , a CIA agent Major Wirtanen ( Goodman ) recruits Campbell who becomes a Nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of the Hitler regime . However , the deal is that the US Government will never acknowledge Campbell 's role in the war for national security reasons , and so Campbell becomes a hated figure across the US . After the war , he tries to conceal his identity , but the past comes back and haunts him . His only " " friend " " is Wirtanen , but even he cannot do much for the avalanche of events that fall upon poor Campbell ... The story is deeply touching , as we watch the tragedy of Campbell who although a great patriot , is treated by disdain by everybody who surrounds him . Not only that , but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him , have many secrets of their own . Vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere , with Campbell 's despair building up and almost choking the viewer.Nolte plays the role of his life , in my opinion ; he is even better than in " " Affliction " , " although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self-destruction . Sheryl Lee is also excellent , and the same can be said for the whole cast in general.I haven 't read the book , so I cannot appraise how the film compares to it . In any case , this is something of no importance here : My critique is upon the film per se , and the film wholeheartedly deserves a 9 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Doppleganger ' , ( or ' Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun ' as it is more commonly known ) was written ( with input by the late Donald James ) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson , best known for their ' Supermarionation ' television shows such as ' Thunderbirds ' .The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun , and proposes a manned flight be sent there . The committee balk at the exhorbitant cost , and shelve the project . But when a security leak at the agency is discovered , fearing that the Russians might get there first , the project gets the green light.American astronaut Glenn Ross ( Roy Thinnes ) is teamed with British scientist John Kane ( Ian Hendry ) . After weeks of gruelling training , the Phoenix blasts off , heading for the unknown.Three weeks later , their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak , mountainous landscape . Ross survives , but Kane is badly injured . A light is seen moving towards them ... I will leave the synopsis here . Until this point , the film has been gripping , with excellent special effects ( by Derek Meddings ) and music by Anderson 's resident composer Barry Gray ( why it has not been issued on C.D. is a mystery ) . But when Ross and Kane crash land , and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is a duplicate of our own , everyone on it is the same , the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting , and ends with a shattering anti-climax . I think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea , in fact Gerry & Sylvia later did something similar on their ' Space : 1999 ' show . Ross risks ( and ultimately loses ) his life in an effort to return to Earth - his Earth . But why ? The new Earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered.Roy Thinnes had recently done ' The Invaders ' television series , and gives a competent performance ( pity there weren 't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ) . Ian Hendry is good as ' Kane ' , but vanishes from the story too soon . Several actors went on to appear in the Andersons ' ' U.F.O. ' such as Ed Bishop and George Sewell . Blink and you will miss Nicholas Courtney ( ' The Brigadier ' from ' Dr.Who ' in a tiny role ) . But the acting honours go to the late Patrick Wymark as ' Jason Webb ' , head of Eurosec . The character is not far removed from ' Sir John Wilder ' , the one he played in A.T.V. ' s ' The Power Game ' . Webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch . Herbert Lom 's contribution ( as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye ) amounts to little more than a cameo.Like I said , the special effects are marvellous , as are the sets . So the film is worth watching , but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet . With a stronger script , this could have been another ' Planet Of The Apes ' or - dare I say it - ' 2001 : A Space Odyssey ' .In Anderson 's productions , he made the future seem like a great place , an adventure playground where science was cool , everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically , sexy women , and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world . We are in the future now and people are still watching ' Coronation Street ' every other night . How disappointing . If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere , one hopes that is a better place than this one . If all the women there look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl , I will be on the next flight ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie documents the Harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties . Much more fun than than Palazzo Volpi , though just as diseased , this movie is a true gem of squalor . One cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness . The sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz . Here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized . The characters ' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer , creating a " " phenomenon of a phenomenon " " effect which makes this movie a piece of art . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I blow hot and cold over Carn챕 . He really can be a puzzle for me . I think perhaps his inspiration left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation . Certainly a man who came to maturity in the Thirties with the Popular Front seems ill at ease in the France of the Fifties , with its rampant commercialism and heavy American influence . He is almost thirty years older than his young stars , and it shows . The party scenes go on much longer than they should , as if he were trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work . Roland Lesaffre 's character--he plays Pascale Petit 's older brother--seems to exist only to reassure the director that his old-style ideas are still sound.At two hours , this picture is far too long . Still , let me praise Pascale Petit for her game performance ; she was a natural who should have challenged Brigitte Bardot for sexpot supremacy , but somehow lost her way . Andrea Parisy is excellent too as the girl who gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate ( yes , they still thought that way in the Fifties ) . Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor who could play an anarchist convincingly : he is great here as he rescues a cat from death , then remarks he can 't stand cats . Jacques Charrier only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor , with that constant little grin and those blank eyes . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For fans of Chris Farley , this is probably his best film . David Spade plays the perfect cynical , sarcastic yin to Farley 's " " Baby Huey " " yang .

" I have been feeling a little disappointed by Tarantino ever since death proof . But i insist it was only a little , because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people . Inglorious Basterds has definitely propelled Tarantino to the top ranks in my universe . This movie can be summed up ( albeit inadequately ) in one word : " " RAW " . " There is an intense emotion in every scene . Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes , From the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the Nazis , and is placed in Tarantino 's fictional dimension of the WW2 historical context . Characters are unpredictiable , fun , scary , brutal , sexy , and other adjectives i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive . I won 't go in to an appreciation of each character , but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances . Dialogue has evolved from the classic Tarantino " " bad ass " " provocative style as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof . One can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino is making more open references to other movies . Indeed , many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience , the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere ; a reference to a movie is close around every corner . It is nice to see that each language presented ( German , French , and English ) is employed rather equally and naturally . I speak both French and English very fluently , and am frequently disappointed in how English speaking characters in french movies act poorly , and how french speaking characters in English / American movies act poorly . Amazingly enough , Tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and graceful performance from his actors . It helps put the audience in context of the historical context . Indeed ; soldiers , spies and civilans rarely understood soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries.The visuals / photography are beautiful , with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s WWII Europe . The outfits are perfect , and the violence orgasmically / realistically conveyed . No punches are held back , and the Nazis are often shown being tortured . This makes the movie not open to all audiences ; the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic. volumes can be written about this movie . But the movie is so good , that during the North American Inglorious Basterds premiere at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal , i had to pee , but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene . I hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie , and i 'm a hard audience to please . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The past few months I have collected Voyager seasons 4 to 7 on DVD ( I only had 1 to 3 on video before that , because Kes is my favourite character ) and have just reached the end . I saw them when they were originally shown on TV here in the UK but had forgotten most of it . Am I satisfied with the ending ? I think I am . Naturally as I fan I would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that 's left to our imagination . In many ways " " Endgame " " is similar to Next Gen 's " " All Good Things혚 " " The involvement of the crew in the future , but mainly the captain . A new romance starting in the finale ( Troi and Worf in Next Gen and Seven of Nine and Chakotay here ) , which results in death in the future . I truly loved " " Endgame , " " fair to all characters , Neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier . B 'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband Tom . Tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured . Harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important . The Doctor , in the future , is well respected by all and finally chooses the name Joe ! But of course the Captain has the largest role , meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties . The Borg are involved , as they have played a massive part in this period of Voyager . Alice Krige plays the Borg Queen again fantastically , just her voice and acting method are magnificent . I feel sorry for Susanna Thompson though , the TV Borg queen replaced by the movie Borg queen . Maybe she wasn 't available though . The special effects are fantastic , the Borg sub space hub and the Borg queen falling apart ! It 's very tense . Especially when they come out of the Borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they 'd be after they 'd said they 'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant . And what a wonderful idea to get inside a Borg sphere for protection , on the DVD special features they say it was like the Trojan horse . Voyager could have continued . If it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home , like in Harry 's speech and what Tom said because his wife and child are there . And then they could have got home in a film ! Overall , Voyager was a bit hit and miss . The sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one . The two episodes set in the Holographic Irish village are horrible ! My perception of Seven of Nine was that she took over , it all revolved around her , which wasn 't true . When she first appeared , season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that . And her character is ingenious at times , 20 years as a Borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity . I like her , especially in " " Someone to Watch Over Me , " " " " Imperfection , " " and " " Human Error . " " When Naomi Wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side , that was lovely . Chakotay became my least favourite character . Gone was the chemistry with Janeway ( will they / won 't they ? ) and you 'd never think he was first officer , he 's completely pushed aside most of the time . I loved seeing Tom and B 'elanna 's relationship blossom against the odds . I always liked Neelix a lot . Tuvok was good at times , especially when he lost his logic , gained emotion and was friends with Neelix . Harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times . The Doctor is probably my favourite , seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates ( " " Tinker , Tenor , Doctor , Spy " " is fantastic ! ) . Janeway is my favourite Captain of any series and you can tell Kate Mulgrew is really enjoying it . I wish there was more , I love Voyager ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves . I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write . This film simply smacked of the real world : the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter , the live-in relatives and their quarrels , the troubled child who gets knocked up and then , typically , drops out of school , a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it . 2 thumbs up . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When my now college age daughter was in preschool , this miniseries appeared on A & E from 8-9 each morning . My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn 't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week . Good choice.I 'd forgotten how much I loved this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently . Timothy Dalton is very handsome , but still perfect as Rochester . The dark , craggy face , the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book . Although Dalton eats a little scenery , I couldn 't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds . The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance.I would love to know what 's become of Zelah Clarke . She is dead on as Jane , quiet , formal , saying volumes with but a look . The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth . Criticism of her performance as " " wooden " " is misplaced . A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor , but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion . Unlike many other screen Janes , she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester 's attraction to her.Bronte 's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact . Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity . Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard , she refuses to be cowed by the dark , blustery Rochester . The two leads play off each other beautifully . This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This documentary about the life and comedy of Bill Hicks features bits from Hicks ' " " Revelations " " and other stand-up gigs . It also features interviews with fellow comedians and people in the industry who knew him , as well as reporters and journalists who talk about how his political commentary was raw and brutal.I enjoyed it very much . I had already seen " " Revelations " " but the comedy clips were still refreshing . It 's a nice balance of comedy and documentary that will explain Hicks ' popularity to non-fans and please those who are already familiar with him.I rated it a ten . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations . I had seen Jacquet 's previous movie ( march of the penguins ) and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio . However , I was severely disappointed . Most of all , this movie is terribly boring . Literally NOTHING happens . I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend , and we both ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like " " well then the winter comes , and then spring , and then there 's an eagle , and a river , and one time it is dark , and the girl goes into a cave , and another time the fox has babies " " and so on . After about half an hour I began sighing , yawning , rolling my eyes , cursing the reviewer at the radio station , and hoping that it would be over soon . But the movie went on and on . When it finally ended I had sunken so deep into my chair that I must have looked somewhat similar to Stephen Hawking . The most annoying parts of the movie are ( a ) The girl , who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with . She wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie ( one year ) , and shows exactly two facial expressions : Joy and Seriousness . She is cute , no question about that . However , a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all-too-human presence . I found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear , drown in the river , or something similarly terrible . ( b ) The commentary by the girl 's adult voice , which tells us nothing but negligible , obvious , boring , redundant things . ( c ) The music , which is desperately lacking subtlety . When the girl is happily jumping around , the music jumps around , too . When the fox is threatened by an eagle , the music becomes threatening , too . It reminded me of the very early days of film-making , and was just too predictable to enjoy . Admittedly , many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it , at least they got somehow involved . Thus , my warning concerns adults only : If you are over ten years old , avoid this movie . You can get a better ( and cheaper ) sleep in most other places . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My 2 year old likes the Doodlebops show , it seems to keep his attention for awhile . The characters are interesting , vibrant with primary colours and all . There 's not much educational content that the intended target audience could benefit from , but they do seem to have a theme each show and try to teach kids about sharing and respect and other basics , so I like it for that . It 's well produced with high production values . But it 's really just an average show like most of the shows on TV these days . We don 't buy into the merchandise angle and have our son wearing everything Dooblebop . I don 't think we 'd spend money to go to a live show , if they ever came to town . Going to The Zoo or the Science Centre is a far better experience for everyone involved and in my opinion is money better spent . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The movie is a really well made one , which is great and looking and passionately directed . You can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection . For the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into it.It 's hard to place this movie under one label . It 's not really a drama , it 's not really a thriller and it 's not really a comedy . Instead its more a movie with its own style , that does things its own way . It doesn 't necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combined.But just like the movie its main character , the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts . The artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and it 's more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie . It doesn 't make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute must-see . In parts the movie also feels as if it 's trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself . It just feels a bit overdone in parts , though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifully.It features some great camera-work and some unique storytelling , which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch.7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In Sudan , the Arabs rule and are constantly at war with the Christians and Animists who inhabit the southern portion of this East African country . This film follows a group of of Dinka boys , a tribe of cattle herders , whom were left orphaned after their village was destroyed and their families killed in a brutal attack carried out by the Arab forces . Most of these boys are now teenagers and have been dubbed " " The Lost Boys " . " The filmmaker follows a group of the " " Lost Boys " " on their journey , as they have been accepted as refugees in the US , where they will land in Houston . Those who 've been accepted as refugees gain celebrity status , as they feel ( from what they 've heard ) that America is amazing . Making a trip from Sudan to America is like " " making a trip to heaven " " says the one young man . A huge party is thrown for their departure , and they are told to do Sudan well , and once they have been educated , to return to Sudan so that they can contribute to Dinka society . They are also warned not to be like " " those with the baggy pants " " whom are responsible for the negative stereotype of Black men , and also , no matter what happens , not to forget the Dinka culture.You watch as the boys come from a third world country into America and how they attempt to integrate into American society , as they have gone from a place with practically nothing to this plentiful world where everything is massively overproduced and overconsumed . They are taught about cleanliness and how to use all the utilities that we take for granted on a daily basis . It is humorous at times , humbling at others.Listening to the comments they make about Black Americans and American society / culture are quite interesting . As the film progresses you see how American culture begins to corrupt their previously humble ways of thinking.One of the boys , Peter , is not content with working and making just enough to survive , so he up and moves from Houston to Kansas City so that he can pursue an education . When the other boys visit him , they talk about how they cannot get into any schools . The main reason they came to America was to get an education and the media is saying that the boys have been brought from Sudan for an education . This is occurring because the boys were given arbitrary ages , making them older than they actually are , preventing them from being able to enroll in high school.The film juxtaposes images from Houston to Kansas . We watch as Peter enrolls in school , where he befriends a group of Christian conservative kids , and as Santiago attempts driving school ( even though he drives without his license anyways ) , and works at Walmart . We see Peter struggle with high school life as he strives to make his schools basketball team , and as Santiago has trouble keeping up with work , the rent , appeasing tensions back home in Sudan , and most of all , coping with loneliness.It comes to the point where the boys want to return to Sudan , and tell them that everything they are taught about America there is lies . " " You must make it alone here , do everything alone " " one of the boys says . A damning message to a Liberal Capitalist lifestyle , showing how it causes people to become radical individualists ( a trend which led to the creation of both the neo-conservative and radical islamist movements ) . Their biggest beef with America though , is that there is no time ; time is money and we don 't waste a second ! Despite all this , the boys never lose their sense of Dinka culture . They celebrate Southern Sudan Liberation Day , which marks the day which the SPLA began to fight in Sudan , a fight which continues today . They also meet with other " " Lost Boys " " on the anniversary of their arrival in America , where they discuss their experience in America as compared to back in Sudan . When asked , one boy says that if he were able to make a living he would much prefer to live in Sudan . It is much too lonely in America he adds . They never lose their sense of community , which has been conditioned into them as part of their culture ! This film makes us question the way we live , makes us question the artificial happiness that materialism and the nature of our societies has created within us . It will also change the way I look at refugees , I will never again take for granted how hard they must work and what immigrants mean for a country such as my own , Canada . This is a wonderful film . I laughed , I cried .. a very emotional journey , and a very well made documentary . 10 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a great movie . It has a captivating story , an awesome main character , very good acting and killer action . This takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story.The story is very well done and there are no holes . Kurt Russell is a solider named Todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives . Eventually the military introduces newer , younger , faster and stronger soldiers . Jason Scott Lee being one of them . As a result they don 't have any need for the old soldiers like Todd . They test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers , in the battle Russell is injured and assumed to be dead . The military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don 't realize is that Russell is alive.Todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on . For a while he lives there but can 't adjust to normal life . He rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people . When they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert.Just as Russell 's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers . What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers . So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd , Todd easily outsmarts them . The military starts realizing this and Todd kills all of their men but one . That one is Jason Scott Lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee . Russell obviously comes out on top.This is one of the best action films I 've ever seen and I 've seen a lot . This has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines . The writer also didn 't forget that Russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women " " sir " . " There are no holes in this film , every minute has a purpose and it 's very entertaining.An awesome one man army action film for fans of Rambo , Commando and Missing In Action . This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action / sci-fi fans . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I enjoyed this for a couple of reasons . The emotional tangle was at times confusing and imperfectly resolved , but the blend of newsreel footage with the film 's narrative was often compelling . The other element that I appreciated was the depiction of the Werewolves , the fanatical Nazis who continued the fight after the formal surrender . I don 't know of another film that deals with them . They assassinated Burgomaster Oppenhoff of Aachen on Palm Sunday , 1945 , for example , and did create problems for the occupation . The film , then , challenges the sanitized version of victory and occupation with some gritty realities . The " " human issues " " are presented not so much through the characters here , but through the historical reality that was gripping those who had survived Hitler -- both conquered and victors . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was five when the show made its debut in 1958 and at a later point , was a regular viewer . I remember that I really enjoyed the show , along with " " Leave It To Beaver " , " " " My Three Sons " , " " " Ozzie and Harriet " , " " " Dick Van Dyke " , " reruns of " " I Love Lucy " , " " " The Real McCoys " , " etc . I am now enjoying the first season of " " Donna Reed " " on DVD and have watched the first two episodes . Donna Stone is shown to be an intelligent , well-mannered , problem-solving , serene , stay-at-home mom , similar to June Cleaver and in contrast to Lucy Ricardo . In episode 2 , I especially like how Ms. Reed becomes a surrogate dad , trading in her dress for sweats and boxing gloves , while teaching her son how to defend himself physically against a much larger bully . While none of the mothers in the neighborhood I grew up in , including my own , exactly met the idealistic standards portrayed by Ms. Reed , it is refreshing to see good manners and intelligent decision-making prevail at the end of the day , in contrast to today 's accepted standards of vulgarity , selfishness and indifference among one 's neighbors . I cannot imagine Jeff and Mary Stone being told by their parents that trespassing in their neighbors ' yards is okay , leaving a dog outside to bark all day is acceptable , or telling their mother to " " shut up " " in a supermarket in front of everyone . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Romantic comedies can really go either way , you know ? You 'll see one that 's really sappy , and you 'll think you want something more realistic . Then , you 'll see one that 's realistic , but it might be too dull to keep you interested . Or maybe you 'll see one that does everything right , but just fails to make you smile . Romantic comedies are tough movies . You go into them with a lot of expectations , and usually , whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you.Of course , if you 've got a girl next to you , and you 're a guy like me , it probably doesn 't matter all that much whether the movie 's any good , you 've got other things on your mind . For you , I say , " " Go get her , Tiger ! " " For the rest of us , I say , " " See _ A Guy Thing _ . " " It 's a lot of fun.Because _ A Guy Thing _ knows you 're going in to this movie with expectations , so it doesn 't pretend that its " " Guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams , and it 's not his wife ! " " plot is going to make everyone happy . Sure , maybe you like it , but maybe it doesn 't ring true , or you think it 's cruel . _ A Guy Thing _ covers that . What _ A Guy Thing _ does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast I 've seen in a long time , so if you don 't the main plotline , you 've still got something to make you smile.Whether we 're talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen , like Larry Miller ( Pretty Woman , Best in Show ) , James Brolin ( Traffic ) , Julie Hagerty ( Airplane ! ) , David Koechner ( Saturday Night Live and Conan O 'Brien regular , Dirty Work , Austin Powers II ) or Thomas Lennon ( The State and Viva Variety ) , or new faces like Shawn Hatosy ( The Faculty ) , or Colin Foo ( Saving Silverman ) , we 're talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film 's inspired characterisation , steal the show , time after time , and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days.And that 's not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along , because it 's very sweet and terribly well done . Jason Lee ( Mallrats , Chasing Amy , Dogma , etc . ) is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control , and Selma Blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is.A lot of the success of the movie , though , falls on Julia Stiles , the right girl in the right place at the wrong time , and she wears it well . Not since , gosh , I don 't know when , have I seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy . Of course , it 's all in the closeups , the voice , and the subtle smiles , but it 's magical , and it 's one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place.But Julie Stiles 's slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead-on in their classic simplicity . This is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types , makes them fall over each other to make you laugh , and then comes through with a great deal of heart.A Guy Thing is a movie you 've definitely seen before , and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it . We haven 't really seen any new romantic comedies since Shakespeare ; the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl . A Guy Thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge , often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play.For the record , it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy , so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of it.And guys , I think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as Jason Lee 's friends in this movie . I 'm not going to spoil it for you , but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema , I suggest you just say " " It 's a Guy Thing , " " and leave it at that . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A big surprise , probably because I was expecting it to suck . The reviews were pretty dismissive of it , even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden : a man finds out his new girlfriend is a super hero , and finds , when he wants to break up with her , that she 's kind of a psycho . I kept expecting it to fall apart , but it never really did . Sure , it doesn 't make as much of its awesome premise as it could , and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the film 's universe . But I can 't blame it for that . Uma Thurman is great as the bipolar superhero , G-Girl . And I 've discovered , after several years of disliking him , that Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a schlub . He 's given two of the best comic performances of 2006 ( the other in the pretty much unreleased Idiocracy ) . I absolutely cracked up at the expressions on his face when he and Thurman first have sex . It 's one of the funniest sex scenes ever . My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a bit too much of a psycho , like almost unbelievably so . Maybe with some background I could have accepted it better . I can forgive its flaws , though , because I had a really good time watching it . Underrated , for sure . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The best romantic comedy I 've seen in years . Not the kind of slick over the top Hollywood stuff by Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler and a lot less syrupy than a Hugh Grant epic . Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are perfectly cast and both deliver smoothly professional performances as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time sowing their sexual oats before marriage . Instead of playing it strictly for laughs the writers and director concocted a nice blend of human feelings and comedic action . Nicholson is just great as the awkward seductress and Mohr does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters into the game but soon finds himself enjoying his flings a little too much . We see just enough of the supporting characters to nicely round out the plot without distracting from the main story . Andy Richter ( earnest friend ) and Helen Slater ( distraught single-mom ) are particularly good . There is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make this a lot more than a standard boy-girl farce . Indeed , with just a little better pacing and a tiny bit more cutting this film would be a top ten comedy . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I saw this film prior to joining the British Army . I went through my basic training , at first difficult and then as I progressed much easier . My time was spent during the height of the troubles in NI and the cold war . There was times when I questioned myself on what I had gotten myself into , not for long , as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively . The voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on , though I would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations .

" " " Midnight Cowboy " " was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic . You know it 's a classic the moment its insistent theme song , ' Everybody 's Talking ' starts up on the soundtrack , ( actually not written for the film ) , and the way the camera introduces us to Joe Buck , ( naked and in the shower ) . We had seen Jon Voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he 's ' one helluva stud ' who 's to doubt him ? This was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if Voight had never done anything else , his performance here would still be legendary . As it is Voight has seldom disappointed on screen ; even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish " " Anaconda " " is a source of pleasure ) .The film became famous and infamous almost overnight . It was a crowd-pleaser , ( even with its downbeat ending ) , funny and sexy and recognizably ' real ' ; ( it was the tail-end of the sixties and all the characters rang true ) . It was also the first ' X ' rated film to win the Oscar as the year 's Best Picture . Adapted , ( brilliantly ) , by Waldo Salt from a James Leo Herlihy novel it was probably the first main-stream commercial American movie to deal with ' taboo ' subjects such as homosexuality and drug-taking in a matter-of-fact manner . Everyone is recognizably human , warts and all , and everyone is treated sympathetically . Voight 's Joe Buck is an innocent abroad , a Candide who comes to New York to seek his fortune as a hustler , ( a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy ; he 's a cross between a gigolo and a social worker ) . But when he himself is hustled by a scraggy , wormy little con-man called ' Ratso ' Rizzo , ( Dustin Hoffman , fresh from " " The Graduate " " and he 's a revelation ) , he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe-dream.Essentially it 's a male love story , ( though totally platonic ) , between these two not so unlikely bedfellows . Both totally alone , both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other , ( Voight with his physical prowess , Hoffman with his street-wise savvy ) . They are misfits adrift from the mainstream , tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others . Though ' straight ' Voight isn 't beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself . ( The whole film posits a strangely ' Christian ' attitude ) .It 's also magnificently acted . While Voight and Hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of Brenda Vaccaro and Sylvia Miles as well as John McGiver , Bob Balaban and Bernard Hughes as sundry customers and hangers-on , beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while John Schlesinger 's direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien 's totally detached eye-view of the American under-belly without rancor and without criticism . On second thoughts , maybe it is a great movie after all . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Roll is an excellent if none-too-serious little story of ' country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-makes-good ' , it is funny throughout , the characters are endearing and the pace is just right.Toby Malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of Matt , said country boy and local Aussie Rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams . He is supported superbly by John Batchelor as local gangster Tiny . Watch out for these two.Highly recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is the first feature film from Australian comedian Mick Molloy . Mick wrote the film with his brother Richard with help from John Clarke , another comedian and actor . Mick & John also have starring roles along with several other iconic Australian actors - Bill Hunter , Frank Wilson et al . The basic premise of the movie is that slimy Jack Simpson ( Mick Molloy ) has become a member of a Lawn Bowls Club for the sole purpose of getting a free car park near his work . The Club is in dire financial straits and calls on Jack to help . John Clarke plays the clubs arch nemesis - he is trying to take the club over and turn it into a " " Poker Machine Slum " " Jack and the other club members band together to try and save the club with many funny twists and turns and Jacks eventual redemption . This is quite a clever little movie . It is well above Mick Molloys usual gutter humor . It is pretty well written and well acted . The older Aussie actors are brilliant ( Bill Hunter , Frank Wilson Monica Maughan and ors ) The film meanders along rather then going at break neck pace , but that adds to the charm of the movie . There is low level coarse language . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " Come Undone " " appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum . Granted , it 's a film that promises a take on gay life , as most viewers expect and somehow , it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young man 's soul . The film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended . It is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that , in the end , will leave Mathieu confused , hurt and depressed when things don 't go according to what he hoped the relationship would be.If you haven 't seen the film , perhaps you would like to stop reading.Sebastien Lifshitz , the director of the film , has told his story from Mathieu 's viewpoint . Most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film , but there are hints that are not obvious , as one can see , in retrospect . The story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film . This is a story about the doomed the love Mathieu felt for Cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life together.First of all , Cedric , the handsome young local , pursues Mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him . Mathieu feels the attraction for Cedric too . We realize how different both young men are by the way Cedric tells Mathieu 's family how he feels school is not for him . On the other hand , Mathieu , who wants to be an architect , finds beauty in the abandoned place where Cedric has taken him . We watch as Mathieu , reading from the guide book , wants Cedric 's attention.When Mathieu comes out to his mother , she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career . She also points out about what future both of them would have together , which proves to be true . Mathieu appears to have learned his lesson , the hard way . He goes on to an uncertain life with Cedric and attempts to take his own life . We watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul.The ending might be confusing for most viewers , but there is a moment in the film when Mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to Pierre , the young man who frequents the bar . That is why when Mathieu goes looking for Pierre at his house , appears to be hard to imagine . Yet , we have seen the way Mathieu is obviously interested in Pierre . The last scene at the beach , when Pierre and Mathieu are seen strolling in the sand , has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy , apparently lost , but then realizing the father is nearby.Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films . This is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level . Mathieu has suffered a lot , first with the separation of his parents , then with his depressed mother and with losing Cedric . Stephan Rideau , who has been seen on other important French films , is equally good , as the shallow Cedric.While " " Come Undone " " will divide opinions , the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care Sebastien Lifshitz gives to the story . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for luck . This one was another totally unexpected gem . Usually , I 'm not even a suspense / thriller fan . This satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a boardwalk pretzel . It has titillating erotic romance , reminiscent of " " Body Heat " " in more ways than one ; it has cops and crime ; political intrigue and just a dash of daytime soap . It has just the right touch of gritty violence that any professional " " by-the-numbers " " crime job must employ . Emma Thompson , ( FBI AIC ) , delivers her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for best fake southern accent by a Limey . Alan Rickman , ( local cop ) , who always seems to steal the show , is excellent but not overbearing . They work well as a pair .

" This cool Marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics . Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay , Spiderman improves in both departments . It also features the voice of Stan Lee , the creator of Spiderman comics.As you 'd expect Spiderman does whatever a spider can . He does more than spin webs . In fact , he uses them as weapons and shields . When he 's not using web in combat , he punches and kicks as well . Spidey has his hands full as he battles Venom , Rhino , Mysterio , Scorpion , and Dr. Octopus to name a few . Look for Captain America in a cameo.Most of the levels are challenging , but some of them require patience to beat . The only complaint about this game is that it 's so short and can be completed in less than three hours .

" Ooverall , the movie was fairly good , a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes , but Chuck Norris did hardly anything , except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters . The movie was very similar to the events of Sept . 11 , with a bin laden-like terrorist sending a video to the president ( Urich ) and threatening to detonate it . Judson Mills had some superb action roles , taking out Rashid 's compound and various kick-butt roles but , there was a lack of Chuck Norris . Judson took over most of the action , leaving Joshua ( chuck ) with Que on her computer . But , overall , it was realistic and didn 't lack the action , but only did it on Mr. Norris ' part .

" Dutiful wife Norma Shearer ( as Katherine " " Kitty " " Brown ) waits on husband Rod La Rocque ( as Bob Brown ) hand and foot . While making him breakfast in bed , and helping him dress for a Sunday golf outing , Ms. Shearer suggests joining Mr. La Rocque for the day , noting how infrequently the two see each other . But , La Rocque puts her off , saying her presence adversely affects his game . Then , unexpectedly , Shearer meets the real reason for her husband 's frequent absences혚 his pretty blonde mistress ! Three years later , Shearer is a glamorous and flirty divorc챕e . While summering in Paris , she has struck up a friendship with wealthy , older socialite Marie Dressler ( as as Mrs. " " Boucci " " Bouccicault ) . Ms. Dressler invites Shearer to her Long Island home , to socialize with some friends , and ask a favor . Dressler is worried about her granddaughter 's relationship with a suave , worldly man . She wants young Sally Eilers ( as Dionne ) to marry Raymond Hackett ( as Bruce ) , instead . Aware of Shearer 's flirtatious conquests , Dressler asks her to lure the undesirable man away from Ms. Eilers . Shearer is stunned to discover the man is La Rocque , her ex-husband.Shearer and Dressler make this a cute , entertaining play . They are in top form , giving guaranteed-to-be-popular performances , with enthusiasm and professionalism . The story is silly and predictable ; yet , in a way which helps the humorous situation . And , the ending is quite clever . In fact , the comic " " Let Us be Gay " " may have aged better than Shearer 's larger-produced , and more serious , " " The Divorc챕e " , " which was released around the same time . The cast uniformly fine . La Rocque is better than his film with Lilian Gish ; but , his role is not at all endearing . Gilbert Emery ( as Towney ) and Tyrell Davis ( as Wallace ) are funny supporting suitors.Those not familiar with Norma Shearer may not realize it is she who appears as the dowdy wife in the opening scenes .

" Definitely worth renting ! Good clean family entertainment . My 4 and 5 year-olds ( and I ) loved it . Kept them on the edge of their seats . I recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this , as it can be quite suspenseful for them . It 's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children , and so this is a rare find . Some of the acting / realism isn 't quite there at times , or maybe is a little corny , but children don 't seem to notice or care , they love it . Parts are predictable , but other parts are not - like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are . The movie doesn 't have any really scary / creepy stuff , and so I doubt it will give children nightmares . It does inspire children to dream , which is something we need to encourage and foster more in our children . Rent and be blessed ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Great fun . I went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film . We came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie . In the first part you just keep asking yourself about this ' malinski ' and ' bellini ' stuff ( there are many more examples of this lingo ) and because they keep repeating the same jokes ( with different twists ) they get funnier and funnier . In search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next . Until half of the film was over we didn 't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing , but we sure had a good time . The house was loaded ( appr . 250 people ) and I think about half of them didn 't like it and the other half loved the film . If you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it . Apart from Clooney This movie deserves a lot better than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this , but when more ppl have seen it I am sure it will go up . 7.0 is reasonable I guess , I would give it an 8 out of 10 .

" This movie sat in a dusty stack of videos in my house for ages before we watched it . We knew it was there- every time someone wanted to watch a movie , it was suggested . It almost became a joke ... " " I know , let 's watch Throw Momma from the Train " ... " I don 't know why it was always turned down , it just was . Little did we know what we were missing out on . It still befalls me why it took us so long ... I mean it stars Danny DeVito , Billy Crystal , and Ann Ramsy ( who we referred to as " " The Lady from the Goonies " " ) , an all star cast that should have appealed to everyone in my household . But there it sat for nearly ten years . Until one day it was suggested and we could turn it down no longer .... It was like finding King Tut 's tomb ... No movie has ever made me laugh so hard , and I doubt any movie ever will . I had to rewind for almost every line because I was still laughing at the line that came before it , and lost ability to hear or pay attention . Not just simple laughing , either ... the kind of laughing that expends more energy than running ten miles in the cold . The kind of laughing that you cannot control , that causes rolling around and spasms , and tears and snot running down your face because it 's just that freakin funny . Once I learned the movie by heart I will say this effect has lessened , but I don 't think I will get tired of watching it and finding new quirks in it to appreciate . I think that 's all I can say .

" A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher / horror genre with savvy , self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation , a little movie produced in Russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions.This movie was MUTE WITNESS . Starring a cast of unknowns ( except an extremely brief cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie ) , it told the story of a mute make-up artist , Billie , who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sister 's boyfriend Andy . She is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody . Overcome with horror she alerts the murderers of her presence , a chase ensues , and finally she is rescued by Andy who take her home as they alert the police . The trouble is ... there is no body , no evidence that anything of the sort took place . Even so , a mysterious inspector seems to be on Billie 's side of the story .... And to say more would be criminal . MUTE WITNESS is the kind of film that demands a scrutiny of viewing similar to the most intricate , clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller , it 's one that pays its dues to movies like WAIT UNTIL DARK and the best of Hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts , deadpan humor , Americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless , and nail-biting suspense until it seems something must snap . Even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy , the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots ( for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing swell of violins ) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away .

" He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in ' Glory ' , he proved he was no ' Malcolm in the Middle ' mediocre actor in ' Malcolm X ' , he showed his brotherly love for acting in ' Philadelphia ' , he pulled a slam dunk in ' He Got Game ' , he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in ' The Hurricane ' , he provided us effective thespian education in ' Training Day ' , and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct ! Denzel Washington 's directorial debut ' Antwone Fisher ' is the most moving film of the year . This tearjerker ' fish 'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season . Unlike that Dolphin tragedy , ' Antwone Fisher ' possesses an emotional joyous conclusion . The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child . Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother . Derek Luke 's debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now . I actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke 's acting as I have seen in Washington 's past performances . It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ' la la la Luke I am your acting father ' . Ok ! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away . Speaking of the great Denzel , his work as the psychologist was masterful . But what can you expect from the acting ' Master D ' himself . ' Antwone Fisher ' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself . The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife 's screenplay was of ' fisher king ' material . I hail to the chief ' Mr. Washington ' in catching the right bait in ' Antwone Fisher ' . * * * * * Excellent , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First , let 's get the " " hoopla " " out of the way.Hedy Lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen.Here we have Hedy as a young fresh-faced 20 year old speaking in her native Austrian.I recently bought a 1990 uncensored version of this 1932 / 3 classic.Yes we see a brief close up of Hedy bare from the waist up but although she filmed the swimming & runaway horse scenes naked , the director Gustav Machaty uses the cover of branches , reflections in puddles , medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene ; so don 't go imagining there are any lascivious close ups or clinches.Her boyfriend , Pierre Nay keeps his clothes on at all times.Yes , fairly daring for its day but how innocous it looks now through 2003 eyes.As other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the imagary , expressionism , and allegorical statements it makes with pictures of drops of water forming a ripple on the surface of a pale of water , farm machinery , landscapes etc.Sweet sounding strings run for most of " " Extase 's " " length and the film has a " " feel " " of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept.The script is highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium of facial and bodily gestures with just a few words of German spoken by the actors with English subtitles beneath.Even these few words seem almost superflous in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film.Put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man ( why we are never told and what did Eva see in him anyway ? Money ? ) , who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage.She then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law.After a ride on her horse Eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her horse 's saddle.However her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off to greet its stablemate.Hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her mount but an engineer at work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner.And so the romance is born.Her husband seeing that his rival must win Eva , later decides to shoot himself but I thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous loveless relationship with Eva.Despite being a 1990 reissue title on VHS , the sound being 70 years old , is a bit soft and with background crackles , in line with films of its age.After a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with Eva he imagines her as a mother with an infant so we have to assume they live happily ever after.Just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind of the style of films even of late 1930 's vintage.This is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title.I gave it 7 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" First of all , there is a detective story : " " l챕gitime d챕fense " " by Belgian Stanislas Andr챕 Steeman whose " " l 'assassin habite au 21 " " Clouzot had already transferred to the screen in 1942 , with Pierre Fresnay and the same actress Suzy Delair.Steeman complained about Clouzot 's adaptation for both movies.The movie from 1942 was excellent , but the " " detective story " " side had been kept , so why complaining ? As for " " Quai des orf챔vres " , " Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career.After having directed " " le corbeau " " and been blacklisted , he had a lot more to say than a simple whodunit.Steeman complained essentially about the poor detective ending , which I will not reveal of course , but Clouzot focused on the social vignettes , on his characters 's psychology , and he did not give a damn about the puzzle 횪 la Agatha Christie.By doing so , he becomes the genuine predecessor of CLaude Chabrol who has always been closer to him than to Alfred Hitchcock whom he admires much though . Suzy Delair has great screen presence , and you will love the song she really sings ( she was a singer too ) " " avec son tralala " . " Bernard Blier gives , as ever , a sparing of gestures and words performance , and he really pulls it off .Two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing : the first one , Dora , the photographer : she takes pictures of female models , and Clouzot , by subtle touches , reveals us she 's a lesbian.Of course , the word is never uttered ( How could it be in 1947 ? ) The police chief ( fabulous Louis Jouvet ) tells her : " " You and me , WE are not lucky with women . " " The portrait of this cop is very detailed : we learn a lot of things about him , not necessary connected with the Delair / Blier plot : he 's a widower , with a son he adores and who runs into school difficulties , particularly in geometry.So we get to know all the characters in depth.One of the most important manifesto of post-war French cinema . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" There 's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode . From the very beginning , an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours . Kirk , Spock and McCoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants , all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown , except for an elderly librarian.The librarian 's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three Enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet 's past . Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England , while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate , frozen waste . The intercutting between the two stories , and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled , with return to the present an unknown chance , while the minutes are counting down to the planet 's explosion . Imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode , with a touching performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age , and Ian Wolfe as the urbane Librarian . Somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever , this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series , which concluded one episode later .

This film shows how it was all done혚.the casting혚.the rehearsals혚.the set and costumes혚and the final presentation of Shakespeare 's play " " The Tempest . " " It had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison . In the play the ship-wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world . Prison life too is much like that.With a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape , the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience , may be not quite as Shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure.More interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character . One inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins . It was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder , shooting and strangulation . One had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions . However ( as someone said ) the past was past , and the present was the beginning of a new future . At least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events.The prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place . Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example . It seems to me that everyone stands to benefit혚not only the Kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched this last night with low expectations . The reasons being , I don 't usually like " " made for TV " " movies and rarely have I liked " " cast reunion " " movies . But , the critic in the Los Angeles Times seemed to like this , so I gave it a chance . I 'm glad I did . It was pretty good . Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves . But , in a way , they were acting as their " " Batman and Robin " " selves . They were being campy and not taking themselves , or this movie too seriously . The movie starts out with them searching for the " " George Barris " " designed Batmobile , that someone stole before it was to be auctioned off for an orphan 's home . While , they are searching for the car , they are also reminiscing about the series that they did together . This is told in flashback . It was well done . The actors that they got , for the younger Burt Ward and Adam West were dead on . And , for a TV movie , it got down to the nitty-gritty about their real behavior on and off the screen . I give this one a 9 / 10 , I liked it that much . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ( the description of the mood of the movie may be considered as a spoiler - because there is not much action in fact ) Great one ... Is it for my peculiar interest for the dystopias and utopias ? Is it for the atmosphere of the movie . Or is there some more magic ? If yes , it is for sure the utmost human one ... This film is , no doubt , extremely artistic / artificial ( depends on taste ) . I can imagine most of the people who hate to watch slow movies ( and those of Tsai Ming Liang ( who I didn 't enjoy other times ) are one of the slowest that I know ) , suffering during the movie . Yes , people are unable to slow down and to let time pass - and to watch it without feeling they waste it . One can take this piece as torture or as a therapy ... The topic at the surface ? The lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - one next to each other - but not really together ? People are tired , sick of something and unable to describe it - just don 't want to meet , touch , talk , confront the others ... like if they had disappeared . The big block of flats looks void and the rain falling constantly evokes the strange melancholy inside . And sometimes it must be something abnormal , unexpected , some unwanted decay as a hole in the floor of concrete - that allows us to reach each other.One of the possible ways to look at it is this : Don 't survey the inner world of the characters - consider the whole movie-space to be inside of yourself . And ask - why is it there ? Where could these depressive states and moods come form ? Is there a place for them , they don 't have a right to be here ? And search for the answers ( if you need them ) among the walls and halls of the block - instead of inside hardly transparent mind of a man.The key to understand is not-to-understand - to let a movie borrow us - as a subject of study - inside itself - and at the end safely return us to our more colorful and " " normal " " looking reality.Then , maybe , you will reach - like me - the feeling of real , possible , non-pathetic hope , that in core we are still humans ... and this state of mind can help one much to live in this world . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I ended up sitting through about the first half hour , entranced by how wonderfully assured the direction , writing , and performances are . The movie is like a who 's who of 50s British character stars : Cecil Parker , Michael Gough , Miles Malleson , Duncan Lamont , and particularly Ernest Thesiger , great as the dessicated old giant of the textile mills . Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood , not character players as such but charming , charismatic leads . This is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well .

" It gives the ordinary guy / girl the chance to be on television singing as their favourite stars.For the majority of the time , they sound like the singer they are meant to be portraying.Another twist to it - A team of make up people and costumers dress the contestant up like that singer . They might not look like them but the likelihood of getting someone that sounds like a person looking exactly the same as them are very slim.It 's a load of fun for your Saturday night - and the contestants aren 't raging wannabes like they are on another TV singing show .

" Being a 90 's child , I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.I don 't know why ; early 90 's cartoons had something special ; I don 't know if it was the uncertainty atmosphere , a generational change , whatever . But " " Tiny Toons " " kept the 90 's vibe and delivered one of the most popular , funny , and underrated cartoons ever created.The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show . Easily , none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way ( before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers ) .The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character . Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Porgy and Bess " " is an outstanding production of George Gershwin 's masterpiece . It is tastefully done in muted colors . The voices are outstanding .

There is yet no DVD available for viewing , and this piece begs for one . All intelligent movie goers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on the new medium . The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that rivals all other musicals including the outstanding ones by Rodgers and Hammerstein . Be sure to ask for it an your video supplier .

" I saw this at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival . There are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commenter 's here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so I won 't too far into giving a film synopsis but you could see a little of Woody Allen and maybe a little of Federico Fellini in this film 's collection of some 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together with no real singular plot . A few of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a a corner bar is used frequently as a central scene where they are always giving last call . The beginning and ending scenes have a common theme too that bookends the film . It took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent on finding the plainest and homeliest looking people in all of Sweden to make the cast . This is Sweden 's official submission for Best Foreign Language Film for the 2007 Academy Awards . It 's a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official submission for best foreign film . Last year Sweden 's official submission was the very weak Farv채l Falkenberg and the year before it was expensive looking but dull ZoZo , so once again Sweden will have no chance in picking up the Oscar . This film has it 's moments and would have made a good 20-25 minute short film but it gets a little old and cold for a full length feature film . Roy Andersson directs . Gustav Danielsson is the cinematographer . Editor Anna M채rta Waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this . Benny Andersson of ABBA fame provides an entertaining music score . It 's an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and I did like it but It 's nothing really special and could only give it a 7.0 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art . This is an oblivious labour of love by the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima that is full truly artistic elements . The movie jumps from color to black and white , past to present , fictional works by Mishima to him . All without being confusing in the least bit . The only thing that gets me is that the entire movie , with the exception of the narrator 's spoken parts is in Japanese . Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn 't found won .

" Bon Voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the requisite silliness of a comedy with just enough sobriety to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome . Most importantly though , the film is also historically instructive ; it captures the tension of the so-called " " phony war " " and , later , the French aristocracy 's flight from Paris ahead of the German onslaught . Yet Bon Voyage is not a " " war movie . " " It is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times . Bon Voyage conveys the chaos , confusion , and emotional bewilderment of a nation of the brink of collapse and the wide spectrum of French reactions to the new political order . This film is a comedy which entertains the audience , a romance which skillfully utilizes many clich챕s , and a story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A large bed possessed by a demon eats people , among other things . I 'm not making this up.Completed in 1977 and not officially released until it came to DVD in 2003 , " " Death Bed : The Bed That Eats " " is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe . You most likely know of it thanks to Patton Oswalt 's excellent bit about it , as well as Stephen Throwers essential book " " Nightmare USA . " " While watching it , you wonder the following-Who is George Berry , and what drugs did he smoke / inject / snort before writing and directing this movie ? -Is this a horror comedy ? A combination of a horror flick and an art movie ? A weird prank being pulled on the audience ? -What the hell am I watching ? " " Death Bed " " really defies any explanation . I know , that term is overused , but it couldn 't be truer than it is here . This truly beggars description . It is a horror comedy , as well as art film / horror hybrid . But the whole thing is so surreal , it must be seen . The score sounds like the electronic bits from an old Candlemass album , the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything , the direction is surprisingly competent , and the movie at times feels like a Jesus Franco movie-that is , if his movies were intentionally funny.In the end , there really is no proper way to describe this movie . Lord knows I 've tried , but really , few movies are as odd , unique , or mind boggling as this is . See it ... but you 've been warned . This is also the only movie George Berry has ever done . He definitely left his mark on the exploitation genre with this , I 'll tell you that much . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It was quite slow moving , with a lot of emphasis on Doyle 's frustration at Sherlock Holmes which was very accurate and excellently portrayed . It was an interesting character study and very well shot ( on digital video , unusual for a period piece ) . The acting was excellent all round , particularly Tim McInnery and Brian Cox although the actor who portrayed ACD , whose name I cannot remember impressed me no end .

" Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code film starring some of the best of the era . It is set in the maternity ward of a hospital , particularly in the room for the women expected to have trouble . In it is an older woman , a tough unwed mother ( Glenda Farrell ) , a frail young woman , an Italian woman , and the main character ( Loretta Young ) who is spending 20 years in prison for murder . Her husband ( Eric Linden ) is at the hospital at every second aching to know that everything will be okay . Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is great at her job.This film is highly interesting and entertaining . It isn 't terribly shocking in any way , but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen . The acting is brilliant all around . Loretta Young is gorgeous here in her prime . Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as can be . His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox .

" Being featured at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and gaining quite some fame , this movie appears to be another modern and profound school drama . It 's about a bunch of adolescents who get through a revealing and desperate day at school . Everything 's circling around a suicide - shown at the very beginning to some extent - that happens at 2 : 37pm . The characters are somehow all connected with each other . What moves them is described via short interview sequences , strictly shot in b / w . The characters are well written , the acting is intriguing ( especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus are discoveries ) .Let 's stick to the movies ' technique . That 's what really impressed me . There rarely are cuts , most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists like in Gus van Sants ' Elephant . Some scenes are presented more often than once , but each time from a different point of view ( here : character ) . This surely evokes a slowly developing , but grabbing atmosphere that drags you inside literally . The colours are vibrant , somehow unfitting considering the tough plot - but that 's nothing less than a clever contrast , a disturbing ' everything 's fine thing ' . The use of lighting is adequate all the time , underlining the characters ' actual mood . And finally , there are decent placements of music.2 : 37 somehow itches you from the very beginning . It does not compromise nor does it serve laughter . It rather strings together what psychologists would define as terror moments . This movie substantially focuses on emotional precipices . There ain 't nobody who 's not to handle some kind of neurosis , even the depicted minor parts ( e.g. the teachers ) seem to be in some state of disorder . And that is what keeps this movie from being really good . Its summing up of piercing tragedies is unrealistic to its very bones . There is no : friendship , love , smiling , truth , passion . There is : faking , humiliation , despair , sickness and beating up . It 's like being hit in the face real hard all the time , but you are numb after the first hour . This flick keeps on hitting you , until it reveals something quite instructive in the end.For being sensitively and superbly acted : 9 . For being technically innovative and original : 9 . For being unidimensional : 3.Makes a solid 7 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Walking with Dinosaurs " " is absolutely brilliant in every regard . Kenneth Branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen . The script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework , it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go . The music is also brilliant , very dramatic when it needs to be . But the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well . The scenery is breathtaking , and the dinosaurs look so real , thanks to the simply astounding effects . This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too.In conclusion , this is a must watch .

If anything , it could have done with being longer , other than that this is perfect . 10 / 10 Bethany Cox , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Budget limitations , time restrictions , shooting a script and then cutting it , cutting it , cutting it ... This crew is a group of good , young filmmakers ; thoughtful in this script - yes , allegorical - clever in zero-dollar effects when time and knowledge is all you have , relying on actors and friends and kind others for their time , devotion , locations ; and getting a first feature in the can , a 1-in-1000 thing . These guys make films . Good ones . Check out their shorts collection " " Heartland Horrors " " and see the development . And I can vouch , working with them is about the most fun thing you 'll do in the business . I 'm stymied by harsh , insulting criticism for this film , wondering if one reviewer even heard one word of dialogue , pondered one thought or concept , or if all that was desired of this work was the visual gore of bashing and slashing to satisfy some mindless view of what horror should mean to an audience . Let " " The Empty Acre " " bring itself to you . Don 't preconceive what you expect it should be just because it gets put in the horror / thriller genre due to its supernatural premise . It 's a drama with depth beyond how far you can stick a blade into someone with a reverence for a message that doesn 't assault your brain 's visual center , but rather , draws upon one 's empathetic imagination to experience other 's suffering of mind and spirit. mark ridgway , Curtis , " " The Empty Acre " " , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Note : These comments are for people who have seen the movie.Vanilla Sky is a brilliant , complex , and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag-line says : LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends . Maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie-goers if one looks at it from a different angle.Considering the following : Now , I have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene , so I will have to further examine my assertions , ( and I welcome your thoughts ) but give this a try and see if the movie doesn 't fall into place : Where exactly does the debatable ' splice ' occur ? Now , I 'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the L.E. ' technician ' , since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of David Aames 's mind / dream / coma state , but the true splice between reality and dream.It seems to me that the reality of the car crash , the way that it is filmed ( no explosion , for example ) is a likely ' splice ' point , and that any particular sequence containing an existential / dream / coma / non-reality feel to it -- whether it 's shown onscreen before or after the crash -- is actually a part of Aames ' personal journey toward self-realization inside of his own mind.In that respect , then , we are left with two questions at the very end ( if you know of more , let me know ) : is Aames actually disfigured , and where does he wake up ? If you don 't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot , or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout , this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today 's pop-culture society . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I can 't quite explain why I find this so alluring and " " The Leopard " " not ; it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film , those intimate moments that Visconti can render so magnificently . Like that film , it has a majestically slow pace , but this time it isn 't overlong . It 's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that . I think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story . Like " " The Leopard , " " it has a sympathetic lead who brings out the same kind of worn pathos -- though Bogard 's performance is more willing to open itself to being unlikable , especially in look : he has a really stupid grin that 's easy to dislike . It 's often quite beautiful in the quiet moments . It 's the opulence of Visconti 's films , the grandeur of the ball scenes , that I find tedious , as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision . But here , that is part of the point -- Gustav surrounded by a visual din.The way in which the object of Gustav 's affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant -- the camera shows a girl , girl , girl , then this beautiful , feminine-featured boy . It 's like an allusion to Shakespeare 's sonnets , and it doesn 't feel heavy-handed . ( It 's not until the camera views Tadzio fully , pulls back and we see his long , slender legs , that we realize he is not a boy , but an adolescent -- at first we 're forced to question Gustav 's attraction in an uncomfortable way ; Visconti must have known that , and he doesn 't shy away from it . ) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav ; we get a sense of the man , we know him . It 's a largely silent performance , and when he does open his mouth it 's to spew venom ; no wonder he wants the angelic , open-featured boy to project himself onto . There 's a difference with Tadzio ( we never know him , just as we never know a handful of Fellini grotesques ; but that 's because his life is another , its own film ) , but it 's not as flirtatious as it 's been made to seem ( there is one scene , however , where he twirls around a pole that 's too much ) . Tadzio isn 't necessarily leading him on -- he 's looking at him ; Visconti just zooms in is all.The film doesn 't detail Gustav as being gay -- Tadzio isn 't even really male , he 's a prettified version of a boy ( delicate , pale , wispy , with golden locks ) that everyone seems to love ( including one gorgeous , slightly older young man who he wrestles with ) . The closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to Gustav 's homosexuality is the famous barber scene , which unlocks his repressed vanity.It isn 't totally successful -- the whole section with Alfred is a waste , and some unnecessary scenes , people carrying bags in long shot , could have been excised . Some parts are heavy-handed , such as when Gustav 's boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass him by -- the looks on his face are too obvious . ( But during the same scene Gustav throws a fit , wanting a new rower , something so unexplainable that it makes up for it . ) But there are some scenes -- touching for the first time -- that build up a remarkable , quiet intensity . Tadzio repeating a piano song again and again , the notes quivering in the air , may be the best example of the anxiety the film has . There is one discussion that contains a debate I 'm especially interested : Can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses , or does it have to go beyond them ? ( We can consider Tarkovsky , who esteems both Visconti and Mann , to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory sensations . ) I think this one manages to do both . 9 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men , and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer . Few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence , and I can think of no other movie -- documentary or drama -- that achieves it . There is no other movie in which I have both laughed so much and cried so much . Yes , it is about DMD and accessible travel ; on those issues alone , it is a worthwhile venture , but it is more . It is about friendship . It is about life itself , about living every day that you 're alive . And it 's a great , fun , adventurous narrative . This is why God created the cinema ! See this movie ! ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A wealthy young man , raised as a SON OF THE GODS , must confront his Chinese heritage while living in a White world.Although the premise upon which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie 's conclusion makes all which has preceded it faintly ludicrous , the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good acting.Richard Barthelmess has the title role as the sweet-natured Oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he looks Caucasian . Barthelmess keeps the tone of his performance serious throughout , gazing intently into the middle distance ( a mannerism he developed during Silent Days ) whenever his character is indecently misused . He makes no attempt to replicate his classic performance in D. W. Griffith 's BROKEN BLOSSOMS ( 1919 ) and this is to his credit . Beautiful Constance Bennett is the millionaire 's daughter who makes Barthelmess miserable . She is gorgeous as always , but her behavior does not endear her to the viewer and her terrible illness in the final reel is kept mercifully off screen.Multi-talented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess ' improvident buddy . Serene E. Alyn Warren and blustery Anders Randolf play the leading stars ' very different fathers , while Claude King distinguishes his brief appearance as the English author who befriends Barthelmess.Movie mavens will recognize little Dickie Moore , uncredited , playing Barthelmess as a tiny child.The original Technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded with time to a ruddy tint . The shot purporting to be the South of France instead looks suspiciously like Avalon on Santa Catalina Island , off the coast of Southern California . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Neil Simon 's Sunshine Boys starring Walter Matthau and George Burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness , but the laughter always bitter taste . Seeing Willy Clark ( Matthau ) and Al Lewis ( Burns ) two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue . Willy not ever surrender and continue to look work , while Al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter . The couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony , but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel , and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between .

The Neil Simon 's screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple Walter Matthu ( Nomination Academy Award as Best Actor ) and George Burns ( Won the Academy Award as Best Support Actor ) . The two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not bear between them . The movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality as the story is narrate and how the report Love-Heat that bind the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible things to the life .

" Okay . To enjoy this silent comedy short you MUST suspend disbelief concerning the major starting point for the film . If you can 't then you 'll probably be more likely to score this film a lot lower . Charlie Chase has a HUGE overbite and his wife has a nose large enough to have its own area code . Unknown to each other , they have both been saving to have surgery to correct these defects . Apparently , plastic and dental surgery was better back in the 1920s because neither seemed to have any need to recuperate from these major surgeries and they looked just dandy right away ! ! Okay , remember I said to ignore this , right ? ! Okay , well you also have to then ignore the difficult to believe idea that both could then meet and have no idea the other is their spouse . Okay , ... now that you allowed yourself to accept these two silly premises , the film gets really , really good.Charlie makes a pass at her and she makes a pass at him . Both are shocked and thrilled because no one has ever really considered them attractive . So , because of this new vanity they agree to go on a date . But , they both sneak back home--not wanting their spouses to know ! Anyway , they meet later and are quite attracted to each other . But what about the poor spouses supposedly at home ? Well , they both learn that the other is married and both anticipate their marriages will result in divorce because they really want to be with each other ! Late in the film , Charlie figures out that the woman really is his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband--by changing his clothes and putting in false teeth when he plays the hubby ! It really is a laugh riot to see him bouncing in and out of the room as he appears to be fighting with another person ! You really have to see it to believe it . However , the wife sees an ad with Charlie 's before and after photos and knows what 's happening . In the end , they both feel pretty foolish ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hayao Miyazaki 's second feature film , and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically ( though his debut - Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best ) , ' Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta ' AKA ' Castle in the Sky ' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like ' Kiki 's Delivery Service ' , ' Mononoke-hime ' and ' Spirited Away ' , but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime . It 's important to remember that ' Castle in the Sky ' was made two years before the revolutionary ' Akira ' , and while it 's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece , the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters , and the story is quite predictable and obvious ( at least in today 's standards ) , Miyazaki 's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before . While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times , the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable - if not as breathtaking as ' Spirited Away ' . And if you 'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low-budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning - you 'll see Miyazaki 's genius shine through as well as it does on ' Spirited Away ' and Mononoke . While ' Castle in the Sky ' , being a sci-fi adventure and very suitable for children , fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since , his motifs and principles still show and play an important part . To say much more would be to ruin the movie , so I 'll kindly shut up . Suffice to say that I 'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn 't go any higher for ' Spirited Away ' and ' Princess Mononoke ' . And that would be a crime.As in most anime movies , I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles , even if you don 't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just don 't tend to be very good , and in this case it 's just horrendous . You might want to watch it in the English version once , though , just for the laughs , and for the star-filled cast ( the English dub was only recorded following the success of ' Spirited Away ' , as it was for ' Kiki 's Delivery Service ' ) - Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek ( Yeah , the Dawson guy ! ) fill the lead roles , Mark Hamill ( Luke Skywalker from ' Star Wars ' , in case you don 't know ! ) plays the villain , and other roles are filled by Andy Dick , Tres MacNeille ( The Simpsons , Rugrats , Animaniacs ... ) , Michael McShane ( Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner 's Robin Hood travesty ) and Mandy Patinkin ( Hello , my name is Inigo Montoya ... ) Good for a laugh , or a few laughs really . But watch the Japanese one first . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Tumbling Doll of Flesh ( aka Niku daruma and Psycho : The Snuff Reels ) This was on my want list for quite a while , and then I finally scored a copy on Ebay a while back . It 's never been on DVD , and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R , which I 'm quite satisfied with . The movie is I believe the most extreme example of torture porn , with an emphasis on porn . A woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed . The porn is definitely real , with the annoying Japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots , without much success most of the time . After the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave , she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat , and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots , and in one of the most disgusting scenes , the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest . This is after both legs have been severed , her arm , and a few other niceities . This movie outdoes the Guinea Pig series by a long shot , in fact , they are not even close to the realism , although cheap gore effects , shown in this movie . This is indeed one of the best fake snuff films I have ever seen , if not the best . Now I must warn you , that if you are not into this stuff , you should stay far far away . This movie is very strong , and with the real sex , it is in a very sick way , erotic to an extent . And I mean , in a very sick way . But wherever you come down on this subject material , this movie brings the goods home , and I would definitely recommend you seek it out . After reading about the movie , I was expecting something very strong , but it exceeded that by a bunch . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The film is really good , it doesn 't use violence or sex etc to sell itself like other films but instead just uses a really decent plot ( based on the original by Michael Caine ) and some great actors to make a fun , action packed film which i thoroughly enjoyed . One thing which made me enjoy this film even more was that it had some actors which i really like such as Edward Norton ( who i last saw in 26th hour , which i enjoyed also ) , Jason Statham ( transporter , enjoyed that also ) and Seth Green who i think is great , his role as Shawn Fanning 's roommate dubbed " " The Napster " " is hilarious and his hacking skills play a great part in the main heist which centres around a large traffic jam in LA . The car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive . I haven 't seen the original so i can 't really compare the too but i liked this a lot and would highly recommend this film to everyone , it isn 't a film where you need to like that specific genre , it will suit everyone , i felt good after this movie , it had a really good ending and was overall really fun to watch . I give it 8 / 10 . Go watch it ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is really special . It 's a very beautiful movie . Which starts with three orphans , Sho , his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi , They 're poor children 's , living on the street , but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money , and then their able to live on , to buy a house , and their life seems to become much better . They 're making new friend , life-friends . But something went wrong and they 're becoming enemies and it all ends up with them killing each other.I was negative about this movie in the beginning , because when singers ( Gackt - Solo , ex-singer in Malice Mizer , Hyde - Solo , singer in L 'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel , both very famous in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer ) trying to become actors , but this isn 't like the other singers-going-actors-movies . They 're doing a great job , and with no earlier experience in movies ( except for Lee-Hom , who had been in two movies before ) .This is absolutely one of my favorite movies . Maybe that 's a little because I 'm a very big fan of Hyde , but - it was this movie who made me discover him.Well , Gackt ( playing the main character - the orphan Sho ) was a part of the group who wrote the script , and it was he who insisted that Hyde should play Sho 's friend , the vampire Kei . At that time they didn 't know each other , at least not like friends . But after the movie they became really good friend , and that shows us too that they really worked hard on this movie and that they had good cooperation.The movie have many different feelings running trough the story , Love , Hate , Sadness , Pain , Loneliness , Happiness and so on . I think the first hour are the best , it 's so beautiful . After that people are dying , Kei 's leaving and it all changes so much . But still it 's a great movie , it 's the only movie who has ever made me cry , it ends up so sad , but still beautiful.So if you haven 't seen this movie , you really should . Because it 's wonderful , but sad . You won 't regret it . ^ ^ , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is apparently one of Shemp 's first shorts with the Stooges . ( This excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team ) . But the threesome 's comedic timing is at its honed best here . Aside from the intense slapstick scenes , there are others more subtle , but just as funny . Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot . Or watch the real object prompting Moe 's exclamation , " " Oh ... highly polished mahogany ! " " Emil Sitka is at his bewildered goofiest . And the goon may look scary , but he 's somehow funny . He seems as frustrated and perplexed with the Stooges as are " " regular " " people in other shorts.For Shemp aficionados , this is a must have episode .

" I was swept into this series just as surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip . Although it started out slowly , I found that the realism in depicting the ship , the variety of characters and lively dialogue keep me watching . The protagonist was destined to be challenged , grow and change on this voyage and I wanted to be there for it . I was not disappointed . The series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in-between , often in the same scene , the same breath . There was a wealth of emotional overlaying , interaction and expression--relentless and compelling to observe . The movement of the ship added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes , making the characters ill one moment and adding humor the next.Edmund Talbot is a complex character , the likes of which we don 't see often . We may know where the captain stands or Mr. Prettiman , but they are older men , set in their ways . Talbot was young and arrogant , still learning , testing himself and being tested . He struggled getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched , that grew with each hard-taught experience . I appreciate the excellent characterization ; it 's too rare in movies and television . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I was told about this movie after watching final destination 2 and watching the extra feature about near deth experience.I bought the DVD of flatliners at the modest price of 5 pounds . Got home and watched it . And i could not help but smile and feel good wondering how this film hadn 't been in my life before . The film is about a group of medical students try to see what it 's like after near death experience . But then there sins come back in reality and can harm them physically.Acting from Kevin Bacon and Keifer Sutherland is great as you would expect from the pair .

" Unlike Bond and other detective movies , Alfred Hitchcock 's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage ( and luck ) would get out of it . Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is Vijay Anand 's tribute to the master of suspense . The tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himself.It is the story of a common man Vinay who one day realizes that he has a double called Amar who in fact is a Jewel Thief . Suddenly Vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this Amar who remains one step ahead of him . The suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme . Just like Hitchcock 's movies , Jewel Thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of Sikkim.Everyone and I mean everyone ; Dev Anand , Vijay Anand , Ashok Kumar , Vajyanti Mala , Tanuja , SD Burman , Kishore Kumar , Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. etc. are in their top forms .

" Sarah Silverman is a dangerous Bitch ! She 's beautiful , sexy , funny and talent , dark and demonic . I read the other ' comment ' on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don 't get it . Nothing that appears on T.V. is an accident .

This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted it to be juvenile . I thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre . It 's a lot like Pee-Wee 's Playhouse for maladjusted , slacker twenty-something glue sniffing , Future Pornstars of America from the Valley . The cast is awesome .

" This movie was recently shown subtitled not dubbed , on Australia 's Special Broadcasting Service . I thought I read here that there is sometimes an assumption that * Revenge of the Rats * is a sequel . In fact , the rats are getting revenge for something that is done within this movie , or in human history . There is no prequel as far as I know.Now , let 's get The Pied Piper of Hamelin out of the way . Perhaps this tale crossed my mind when I was watching the film , but that 's all . There was the use of the word " " coffers " " at the end of the movie . A dazed mayor tries to justify her actions by saying " " the coffers were empty " . " " " Coffers " " isn 't a word you hear around much these days , unless you read folk tales to your children , as I do . Since seeing * Revenge of the Rats * , I 've read two versions of The Pied Piper of Hamelin . Now I see the comparison . A metaphorical fat but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford , to get rid of the rats . This is about as far as I can follow the analogy . The children are not led to a door in a mountain , with one lame boy left behind to tell of a land of winged horses and fountains , where it is always spring and everyone is always happy.There 's a lot that is quite mainstream about this movie . The romance and the resolution especially . The female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are really quite impotent . Where this film is quite rebellious ( as compared with American cinema ) is that it is anti-authoritarian . The helicopter pilot is sacked by the mayor for " " doing good " . " The mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and pandering to big money . Finally , it is left to one doctor in Frankfurt to solve an epidemic of a fatal and contagious disease . Apparently there is no national Infectious Diseases authority to co-ordinate things or send in back-up.I 'm not a horror aficionado , so any horror I do see is usually mingled with humour . Right from the rat in the blood bank you can see this is going to have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers ; the huge number of rats is impressive and the horror fans seem to be satisfied too . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I remember seeing this movie back when it was released and I still remember the ' buzz ' I felt when I left the cinema . Everything about this movie is magnificent !

Nicholas Cage was great and whenever I see Cameron Dye in anything nowadays , I always associate him with this movie . It is too bad the rest of the cast didn 't go on to greater things but maybe that is part of this film 's charm.I won 't do a film school critique as I am sure all the analysts out there can find fault if they wanted to , but what I will say is that this movie defined my teenage years and still continues to influence my life over 20 years later . The movie ' feels ' great and stirs up emotions when you watch it ( well ... it did for me ) and I cannot recommend it highly enough for anybody who has not yet seen it.You either ' get ' the movie or you don 't !

" Fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition , especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days.As has already been pointed out , this is hardly a real zombie film , but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers . While there are necessarily some bloody scenes , there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented ( feel-good 50s style ) , I can 't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by Fido & his fellow sufferers.While the cast is generally good , I felt that Moss and Nelson stood out . The humor is not in-your-face , but rather subdued ; there 's a lot of attention to detail and I caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie . This is certainly no masterpiece of cinema , but it doesn 't strive to be - instead , Currie succeeds in delivering a heart-warming black comedy . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Most people will consider that Yul Brynner 's greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I. Certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in , from comic , to tragic , from eager to learn to dominating to hateful . It also showed him to advantage as a " " talk singer " " and a dancer . Finally , as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway , the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as well.But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I. His comic turn in ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was quite nice . So was his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA , or his Ramses in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS . Yet he came terribly close to being a 1950s successor to Eric Von Stroheim as " " the man you love to hate . " " A certain vulnerability in his acting and roles endeared him to the movie public , even after his best years as a star were behind him - and he retreated more and more to repeating the King of Siam on television and the stage.To me , his finest performance is in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr , Jason Robards Jr . , Robert Morley , E. G. Marshall , Anne Jackson , and Ronnie Howard . The film is set in pretty modern times - the powder-keg that was Hungary in 1956 , when briefly it looked like the Iron Curtain was about to collapse there under the reforms of Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters . But the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to bad timing . The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks in to crush the revolt ( and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers ) . The West stood by and let this happen : England and France had gotten caught in the Suez crisis , and the U.S. had berated them and Israel for attacking Egypt . Due to the actions of three close allies of the U.S. , the West found it hard to condemn the overkill of the Soviet Union . It was an unfortunate situation , and the Hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned in it.In the film Brynner is Major Surov , a Russian intelligence officer who is watching for some of the leaders of the Hungarian revolt , one of whom is Paul Kedes ( Jason Robards ) . Kedes may be getting assistance from some westerners on a bus tour through Hungary , led by Robert Morley ( including Marshall , Jackson , and Howard , and Kerr ) . The latter are being kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired , and Brynner mingles with them , hoping for a lead to the whereabouts of Robards . But Brynner is human - he tries to be ingratiating with these people ( all of whom see him as a monster ) , and in sequence , when he has drunk a little too much , he confronts them with the questions that has bothered historians since 1945 : How is it ( even if one notes that Russia had Stalin in charge ) that relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly ? The allies , on the whole , had worked well together from 1941 to 1945 , but after Yalta and Potsdam all types of mutual suspicions just erupted . Did they have to ? Surov is a good officer , but he is torn in half by loyalty to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary that he supports , and his growing fondness towards Kerr , who is hiding Robards but is also willing to note the more human side of the Russian major . And as the film reaches it 's tragic climax , we watch as Surov has to decide if he will follow his sense of duty , or take pity on Kerr , Robards , and the other westerners who want to leave . It becomes a true struggle for him - and one that he may win far too late . It was a great film about a tragedy of post war Europe , and possibly the most thoughtful role Yul Brynner ever portrayed . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Even as a young boy , I remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial ( those who have seen it know what I 'm talking about ) . Such imagination ! A perfect blend of romance , drama , humour and fantasy , this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made : Citizen Kane , Casablanca , Gone with the Wind . This movie is rated extremely high by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51 % voters rated it 10 out of 10 ; over 84 % rated it 8 or higher out of 10 . I was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen / rated this movie , compared to those on the list . What a pity .

" To say this film is simply a demonisation of Catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue . That is not what this film is.What this film is is a comment on the abuses of the Church ( although this could be substituted for any powerful body ) , the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves . The fact that it is the Catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon . To label this as propaganda against Catholics seems to miss the truth about what the Catholic Church has done at times ; its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted . Yes we should comment on the abuses committed by other organisations but that is not for the remit of this film.It is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching - ' if we do not study the past , we are bound to repeat it ' , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Great movie about a great man . Thomas Kretschmann is first rate as in all of his other movies.I would never have envisioned him as Pope John Paul . It speaks volumes for the casting director . Why do they keep casting him as German officer in the movies ? And he only came to universal attention after " " the pianist " " ? Of course he looks so hot in the uniforms . I know a lot of girls drool over his handsome face . But this guy is a great actor and has such great potentials . If you don 't believe me , go watch " " Stalingrad " . " I hope he will get a lot of excellent roles in the future with more diversity . Otherwise , what a heartbreaking waste of great talent . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Love it or loathe it , it 's hard to not find Warren Beatty 's take on " " Dick Tracy , " " the 1990 film adaptation of Chester Gould 's famous comic strip , anything short of a genre classic . Superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years , and may soon become a genre all on its own.Beatty 's film liberally uses Gould 's source material to full effect , shooting in all six of the strip 's primary colors , and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger-happy mutant gangsters and loose , seductive women a lush visual style and tone.It can be stated that the film 's strong visual aesthetics drastically short-change the characters and their acting abilities , which I don 't think can be any further from the truth . " " Dick Tracy " " relishes in its look and ghastly characters , and Beatty himself , who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title , is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs.Other than the visual treats and Oscar-winning makeup , there is a plot , and Big Boy Caprice ( Al Pacino , deliciously over-the-top in an Oscar-nominated performance ) , seeks to eliminate Tracy in one well-planned move , but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him.Tracy , meanwhile , is juggling his relationship with Tess Trueheart ( Glenne Headly ) , who as her name would have it , remains faithfully by his side and cares for The Kid ( Charlie Korsmo ) , who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime-busting hero . Tracy 's fidelity to Tess is tested by the tempting advances of Breathless Mahoney ( Madonna ) , who is also Big Boy 's main squeeze . At the same time that all of this is going down , things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town , and decides to play both sides against the middle.The performances are good , as Beatty 's focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material , as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects . Pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role that 's truly standout from the rest . " " Dick Tracy " " is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre . I think that if Chester Gould was still alive , he would be proud of Warren Beatty 's take on his beloved crime-fighting detective.8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It occurred to me while watching " " Imaginary Heroes " " that any screenwriter attempting to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing off a kid or two in the opening reel as a way of getting his characters to open up and reveal themselves . There must be something to this storyline , for it seems as if every other family drama that comes down the pike uses this device in one form or another ( " " Paradise " " and " " Moonlight Mile " " are just two of the more recent examples that spring immediately to mind , although one could reach back to a golden oldie like " " Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? " " to make the point as well ) . It 's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore . Far from it . It 's just that , like any topic , it can be so overused that it becomes just another movie clich챕 , a convenient bit of narrative shorthand to get the ball rolling and to give the characters something to grapple with for the remainder of the time we get to spend with them.The latest such work is " " Imaginary Heroes , " " a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the earliest and , perhaps , best known examples of the " " family coping with the death of a child " " genre , the Academy Award winning " " Ordinary People . " " Like the characters in that earlier film , the Travises seem , on the surface , to be the ideal suburban family , until , one fateful day , their oldest son , Matt , who is the " " golden boy " " athlete and , thus , the apple of his father 's eye , kills himself with no explanation ( one minor difference is that the son in " " Ordinary People " " dies as a result of an accident , not a suicide ) . It is Matt 's younger brother , Tim , who winds up finding the body , and who assumes the role of protagonist in the film . Each of the remaining family members copes with the tragedy in his or her own way . Matt , who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother , becomes more and more estranged from the father who has virtually ignored him all his life and begins to turn to drugs for surcease . Ben , the father , becomes swallowed up in feelings of remorse and guilt , turning away from both his job and his family . His wife , Sandy , is the most complex character in the film , a free-spirited child of the ' 60 's who feels oddly adrift in the role of mother and wife as she endures a basically loveless marriage in sterile suburbia . She spends most of her time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with her pot-smoking past.As written and directed by Dan Harris , " " Imaginary Heroes " " emerges as a wildly uneven film . For every scene that feels real and authentic , there is another that comes across as arbitrary and inauthentic . One sometimes has the sense that Harris would like to cram every possible life situation he can think of into his screenplay , an admirable goal , perhaps , but one that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process . Instead of identifying with the characters and being caught up in their plight , we often find ourselves thinking , " " Oh , come now혚what next ? " " For teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot-button topics covered in this film ; the screenplay also touches on drug and alcohol abuse , physical abuse , sexual identity conflict , life-threatening illness , even inadvertent gay incest . It is this " " everything but the kitchen sink " " mentality in the writing that robs the movie of much of the credibility it needs to really make us care.That is not to say that " " Imaginary Heroes " " is a bad or unrewarding film . Much of what it has to say about familial relationships and values in the 21st Century is insightful , original , pointed and profound . Prime credit for its success goes to the actors , Emile Hirsch , Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels , who deliver incisive , sensitive performances in their respective roles . It is they who triumph over the narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts . Moreover , Harris , in his direction , achieves an effectively melancholic tone throughout , but one that is frequently augmented by some badly-needed flashes of daring dark comedy . " " Imaginary Heroes " " may appear unfocused and derivative at times , but its fine performances and subtle mood shifts make it a film worth watching . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Despite the feelings of most " " Star Wars " " fans , in my opinion " " Return Of The Jedi " " is the greatest cinematic film ever created . Ever since the first time I saw it , it 's depth , intensity , special effects , and moving story have overwhelmed me .

Filled with powerful action , as the climax of the original trilogy , George Lucas gives us a rousing finish of the " " Star Wars " " saga in " " Jedi " .

" Martin Ritt seems to be a director who was always interested in social issues ( as the son of immigrants , he had every incentive to be so , especially since he was blacklisted in the ' 50s ) . " " Conrack " " is based on Pat Conroy 's novel " " The Water is Wide " , " about his own experience in 1969 teaching a school of impoverished black children about the outside world , much to the chagrin of the right-wing superintendent ( Hume Cronyn ) . What added to the movie 's strength was the cultural and historical context : Conroy ( Jon Voight ) frustratedly tells another teacher how many of the children don 't know about Paul Newman , Sidney Poitier , the Vietnam War , or even where Vietnam is . He proceeds to enlighten them about all these factors.Somewhere , I read a complaint that when Conroy played music for the children , he only played white music . The truth is , you can 't blame the movie for that ; it was based on Conroy 's real experience . Either way , the movie 's a real gem . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There is no need for me to repeat the synopsis rendered by Glenn . The black and white rendition is even more powerful in portraying the bleakness of country village life at that time . The deep measure of friendship shown by Babette toward the two elderly sisters touches the heart strings . The supporting cast is excellent and their performances superb , it would not be fair to single out any one character since the entire story depends on the cast as a whole .

" What a great movie this is . I found it full of the delightfully unexpected pain of being a single father of a teenage girl . And it is set in a tropical island ' paradise 'as well . Gerard Depardeiux brings his special European flair to this story about a divorced father of a teenage girl . They are on holiday together and she begins to add to the excitement on the island in many unexpected ways . But you will need to see the film for yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find for themselves.There are a few cult classics which all teens should see . This movie should be added to the list . In addition to Dirty Dancing , Ferris Bueller 's Day Off , Bill and Ted 's Excellent Adventure , Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House , My Father the Hero should be required film study . Watch it as if you had a teenage daughter and you 'll be rolling with laughter . Watch it with your teenage daughter and prepare to be laughed at for months . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life . The pacing , the camera work , the emotion , the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see . It isn 't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted . The only flaw I can see about this film is that it wasn 't captured in a more technically perfect film format . It deserved Todd-AO , Technicolor and the very finest sound format available . ( An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter . ) The gorgeous Italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard . As it is , it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film . I can 't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite . The transformations of the characters from contained , tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and I really should recommend it more often.The casting is perfect , the mood is perfect , the acting is above reproach . It is a film about middle age and the choices people make.It is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness . Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you .

" Despite a few acceptable adaptations of the books ' main themes , QUEEN OF THE DAMNED / THE VAMPIRE LESTAT did not stay true to Anne Rices 's complicated story telling . The deep layers that build up all the characters were shredded apart to only their surface , if not a completely different identity . The chronological order of the major events in the movie seemed warped and uneven.However , there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of 7 . One was that the film strongly captured the affect that Lestat ( among other vampires ) had to the public , especially young girls . The movie also did a fairly good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history that the vampires took pride in . The scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying.The acting in QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate , if disappointing . Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have a surprising chemistry , though it only shows when the acting is at its best ( not very often ) . The characters are nothing compared to the ones established in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE . It also lacks the emotional intelligence of THE FEAST OF ALL SAINTS , which is a shame because Rice 's Queen of the Damned book had that , and more.This movie doesn 't give all that it appears to be . The effects are dull and very disappointing . The extravagance needed in many scenes is not given , and the dialog is tiring . The settings for many scenes are not how I pictured them in the book , and I think that many of them weren 't even taken from the story . There are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the movie , but it wraps itself up fairly neatly , giving the viewer a full story ( if they had not read the book ) .Somethings that I feel the movie needed include a good original score ( Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein ) , instead of the mix of rock music ; though I had no problem with some of the songs . Another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction . The scenery was boring as well as unclear , which is important in a story that moves around quite frequently.Overall , QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was an unevenly disappointing yet somewhat satisfying adaption of the important novel . With a few simple changes , it may have been a very successful piece of film work . I 'd recommend this movie for people who has seen INTERVIEW or have read the books , so that they can make their own opinion on the adaption . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film speaks a universal language ; one can relate it to the self , community , society or the wider world . It has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction / ownership . The portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us which must be recognised as being the repeating cycle of destruction , the opposing force of innovation , creativity and growth . The factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled . The Idea , is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into one 's internal voice / conscience through the looking , it makes one feel as opposed to just watch . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Brilliant acting helps too . Coop gives one of his most convincing performances as the reticent hayseed-turned-fearless bootlegger ( the sort of character progression he was to repeat in other roles such as Sergeant York ) . Miss Sidney ( pictured center ) in her first major role is also an eye-opener . The principals receive great support from Paul Lukas , Wynne Gibson and Stanley Fields as the heavies , and even from Robert Homans ' hard-as-nails detective .

" This isn 't as violent as I was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective.There are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who 's side a particular character is on.The plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the Triad gang it follows.The violence when it comes is brutal , no guns or martial art scenes with special effects , this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organisation.The ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I first saw Love in Limbo playing late on free to air TV about five years ago , and since then it 's a movie I 'll always remember warmly as one of those films you see and are forever influenced by.For the uninitiated , Australian film has a long history of making off-beat comedies about lovable losers , and Love in Limbo is a sterling example of this . Whilst Russel Crowe is the only name actor in it ( although these days he 's all a movie needs ) , the rest of the Aussie cast is good- he still steals the show as a nervous , nerdy , virgin loser though.The general premise is a lot like American Pie . A group of friends wanting to get laid and become men . As you 'd expect , the entire movie focusses on this ( with a sub-plot about the lead 's mother and various other incidents ) , and is full of humorous situations that push it towards the inevitably sweet ending.If you enjoyed American Pie , don 't expect this to be the same- but expect the same conventions to make appearances . Love in Limbo isn 't a gross out romantic comedy- but it definitely has its share of laughs , fist pumping moments when the good guy wins , and the situations every guy , Australian or otherwise , can relate to.See it if you liked : American Pie , Almost Famous . Strengths : Good Aussie cast , easy to relate to , good perve value . Weaknesses : Predictable at points . My Rating : 8 out of 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am normally not compelled to write a review for a film , but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair , so I feel it necessary to share my point of view . " " Krisana " " ( or as it was titled at the theater I saw it , " " Fallen " " ) follows Matiss , a lonely Latvian archivist , as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didn 't try to stop from jumping off a bridge , as well as her reasons for doing so . That 's the plot in a nutshell , but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act . As a detective who investigates the incident tells him , we usually don 't bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die.Comparisons to Michaelango Antonioni and his " " Blowup " " will most likely abound in any review you read about " " Krisana . " " The influence of Antonioni 's philosophical and austere style and the story of " " Blowup " " are clear and , in fact , writer / director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which Matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge , or at least who he thinks did.The only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the " " college film class " " look and sound of the film . He or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist Latvian film most likely faces , but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of Matiss . The background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a Fellini film , whether or not that was Kelemen 's intention . The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money , but this constraint is used to the film 's advantage . " " Krisana " " succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self-serious . It could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story , but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt . If you are more concerned with plot , this film and its ending may frustrate you . Otherwise , take the time to be engaged by it . It is well-worth seeking out . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Watching this hilariously retro but very entertaining career girl tale , I was floored by Joan Crawford 's first appearance .

As they walk down the street , you can see part of a sign in back of them for the Stonewall Bar -- scene of the epochal " " riots " " that are considered the trigger for the modern gay rights movement.Speaking of Baker and taxis , I had to laugh when she gets into one and tells the cabbie , " " 56th and Sutton Place , please -- and be careful of the bumps .

" I had never paid much attention to this flick until I learned that Paddy Chayefsky - author of the brilliant " " Network " " - was the scriptwriter . His work there had instructed me as to his genius , so when ' Hospital ' appeared on TMC , I was anxious to see it . I was not disappointed . Looking at both this film and " " Network " " it would seem that his big theme is the absurdity , inanity , and sheer viciousness of large human enterprises ( e.g. , hospitals , networks ) against the sanctity of individual experience and the human spirit , and all of it delivered with a knife-edge sense of utterly black humor . " " Hospital " " is as black of a comedy as " " Network " " is , and the excellent cast , led by the incomparable Scott , does his work full justice .

" Mikhail Kalatozov 's The Cranes are flying is a superb film . Winner of the golden palm at Cannes Film Festival , it has an excellent cinematography and performance by Tatyana Samojlova , the only Russian actor ever to win an award in Cannes for a performance . She plays Veronika , a teenager in love with her boyfriend , happy and without preoccupations , with plans of getting married . Her life will get upside down when World War II strikes and her boyfriend volunteers to the army . The film depicts the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people that stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight , waiting for a letter or other information . It is a portrayal of lost innocence . Samojlova does a magnificent job , and her character transformation will break your heart . The camera movement is fast with a lot of close-ups , it is a dancing camera . The first scene in the stairs is fantastic , but it isn 't the only one , there is later a scene when Veronika attempts committing suicide , and another , in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history , the bombing of Veronika 's house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire , to find her apartment completely destroyed .

" I gave this show a chance because of Jaleel White , not for his Urkel character , but mainly for the Sonic the Hedgehog voice XD So anyway , like I said , I gave it a chance , and I was very fond of it . I never cared for the Urkel character , so I was pleased to see Mr. White in a role other than the ever-so-annoying nerd . And his Calvin J. Fraiser ( first called Calvin , but come the second episode , everyone started calling him " " J " " ) was very entertaining and interesting.I think my favorite episode was when J was dating the ex-Cowboys cheerleader with the snobby kid . ( " " Don 't you talk that way ' bout my momma ! " " " " This is grown-up talk , you stay down there ! " " ) The only beef I have is that the show was suppose to have 3 main characters , but Mr. White 's character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two ( who are married ) always had the back stories ... It isn 't exactly a good thing when a story about those two possibly being pregnant takes backseat to J. having to babysit his girlfriend 's dog ..... Other than that , I really wish this show could have lasted a little longer .

There are 3 girls : English , Belgian and Spanish , as well as three boys : German , Danish and Italian . Our French guy will also get there . A year is a very long time .

He comes out of the idea that young people are everywhere just the same . They like jokes . They like to make irresponsible relationships . But they don 't neglect their aspirations . The most interesting is the sum of experience of this little community . They live together in the fire of everyday tasks fighting with the surrounding reality . They are full of unusual ideas for life . Young Europeans come back to their countries to take up a life of an adult on their own . They are Europe 's hope to fight the many problems of the Union . For example , the terrifying administration system . In the end they proof that not only can they communicate and make friends despite the many differences . But they also now how to live the full of life . And they won 't allow taking that full of life away from them . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Director Douglas Sirk once said ' there 's a very short distance between high art and trash , and trash that contains craziness is by this very quality nearer to art ' . This statement defines his cinema perfectly , a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations , adventure and war films , westerns and of course , his famous melodramas.Sirk 's melodramas were , as the very word signifies , dramas with music . The music sets the tone for his masterful style , and every stroke of his brush ( Sirk was also a painter ) leaves a powerful image on the screen-turned-canvas . But this ain 't life but its representation , an imitation of life . Sirk never tried to show reality , on the contrary . None of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by Hollywood ( most notably Technicolor ) to distinguish the artificial from the real thing . Let 's remember that his golden period coincides with the time when Hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama ( Blackboard jungle , Rebel without a cause ) . Sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else.Another of Sirk 's statements summarizes this : ' You can 't reach , or touch , the real . You just see reflections . If you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass ' . I defy anybody that has seen Written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen . One ends up giving up.Therefore , we are in a hall full of mirrors where there 's no difference between real and its false copy . Nobody can say that the Hadley are real people . That town ain 't real either , with those hideous oil pumps all over the place . So in this realm the acting is affected , the decore is fake , the trick is visible . Everything is pushed a little bit off the limit ( the sexual connotations of Dorothy Malone with the oil tower , for example ) . Sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time . ' The angles are the director 's thoughts ; the lighting is his philosophy ' . In Written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows . The Hadleys house , with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way . A house that resembles a mausoleum , that no party can cheer up . As tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night , Sirk 's photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters , and so are the colours of the clothes they wear . Drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director 's craft.Sirk considered himself a ' story bender ' , because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose . Written on the wind is a good example . It wouldn 't work in any other hands.The other director that was using similar strategies was Frank Tashlin , who was for 50 's comedy the same that Sirk was for melodrama . Their films are full of the machinery of american life -advertising , TV sets , jukeboxes , washing machines , sport cars , vacuum cleaners- to depict its emptiness and decay . I 'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences . The game was played by both sides , so it was camp . Now we regard them as ' cult ' or ' bizarre ' , because we are not those spectators anymore . That is why Todd Haynes 's homage ' Far from heaven ' turns into a pastiche , because it reproduces Sirk 's work nowadays as if nothing happened in between . Then Sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that Julianne Moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film.Sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly . There were always immovable characters ( Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall here ) against which he could assemble a series of split ones . His balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters , because these are the ones Sirk is interested in too . When Robert Stack flies the plane and ' tempts ' Lauren Bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them ( obvious Faustian echoes ) we are strangely fascinated with him too , as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with Mitch alone by the river.In the Sirk 's universe the studio often-imposed ' happy ends ' have no negative impact . In fact they worked just great . Sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the Deux ex machinea of his day . Thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback , so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the Hadley feud.It was pointed out the many similarities between Written on the Wind with the Godfather saga . I absolutely agree and I 'm sure the parallel is not incidental . Both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family . The temperamental son portrayed by Robert Stack has an amazing physical resemblance with Jimmy Caan 's Sonny Corleone . The action of fighting her sister 's male friend is symmetrical . The non-son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films , as the fact that both families carry the names of their town . Even details as the gate that gives access to the property , and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves , suggest that Coppola had Written on the Wind in mind while setting his masterwork . Because both films deal with the subject of Power : the acquisition of power , its manipulation and legacy ( even Kyle Hadley 's sterility , the event that hastens the turmoil , is an issue easily tied to the central theme of Power , in this case , a weakness in sexual power ) . The other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is Citizen Kane . One wouldn 't think at first of similarities between Welles and Sirk 's films but there are a good many , starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family 's fortune and ending in the fact that Mitch Wayne ( Rock Hudson ) , as Charles Foster Kane , was adopted by a tutor , having his own father alive . Amazingly , the same actor ( Harry Shannon ) perform both Wayne and Kane 's fathers . This detail is cannot be a coincidence.Written on the Wind is a masterpiece in every aspect , in execution and vision , in style and technique , a highlight in the career of this wonderful director . Some say that this is his best film . In my opinion , ' Magnificent obsession ' , ' All that heaven allows ' , ' There 's always tomorrow ' and ' Imitation of life ' are just as good . And for those who put Sirk in the level of Dallas or Dinasty I wish them no happy end . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What do you get when you have a tenacious , seasoned French police inspector by the name of Maurice Martineau is called to solve a murder case ? Well , simply a very entertaining , fun film . The re-mastered black-and-white film " " Quai des Orfevres " " delivers the goods despite romance , jealousy and marriage that seem to just get in the way towards the truth of ' who done it ? ' Inch by inch , technique by technique as seasoned by experience and intuition , the patience of this master Inspector etches into the truth -- but of course , with the help of a bag full of dirty police interrogation tricks.Martineau is the centerpiece of this film . The use by director Henri-Georges Clouzot of raucous background music to intensify the drama in grand film noir style is a wonderful wrapper around the visual experience.Martineau eventually solves the mystery and arrests the culprit . Hey , he is good ! ! But alas , Martineau , too , can keep a dark secret in his past . Who is that boy that is perhaps not his son ? Some things can never get solved -- even beyond the closing credits . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Rod Serling was , of course , a genius and his wonderful , playful , creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development . There are no such shows now , but rather " " Housewife " " sluts ala Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher , or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech screens.Jack Elam edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual craziness that I can 't help but think that Rod Serling was tailoring that long ago week 's show around Elam , even though he was an ancillary to the flow of the story . This episode ends with a twist , as usual , but shock and humor are mixed with especially " " Serlingesque " " dexterity.Rex Lewis Field , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Who would think Andy Griffith 's " " Helen Crump " " ( Aneta Corsaut ) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past ? But that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie , which might best be described as Rebel Without A Cause meets God Knows What From Outer Space . The Rebel is Steven McQueen ( who would shortly decide that " " Steve " " sounded less prissy ) , a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting ; the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut . It was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodders , but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous , man-eating What Is It that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor--and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left . But will the grown ups believe them ? Of course not , what do they know , they 're just kids ! The movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best . The actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously , with many a soulful look into each other eyes , and the " " adult " " supporting cast probably says " " Kids ! " " very third sentence or so . But the real pleasure of the film its creature , which is well imagined , well-executed , and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense . And although clearly on the cheap side ( check out those miniature sets , guys ! ) , THE BLOB is actually a fairly well-made film--and there 's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure . The 40-plus crowd ( myself included ) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia , but that won 't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-bread 1950s sensibility , and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophisticated " " grown ups only " " get together .

" I sought this film out because I 'm a new Frain fan and wanted to see more of his work . First of all , his Irish accent is great . He 's got a keen ear for dialects , it seems . His acting was marvelous , as usual . James Frain aside , I thought the film was very well done . It showed the conflict in Northern Ireland as the * mess * it really is . Both sides are guilty of grave injustices , and the men drawn into the conflict usually have very little to say about their circumstances.Also , it is interesting to realise that not every man ( or woman ) that is supposedly fighting for his country , is really doing * just * that . For example , when Kenny ( James Frain ) asks Ginger ( Ian Hart ) why he does " " it " , " Ginger can 't come up with a morally acceptable answer . Why ? Because Ginger isn 't in it for the noble cause of protecting his country or the rights of his fellow Protestants ... Ginger is in it for the fun of killing . He 's full of blood-lust and it 's the perfect job for a guy like him . In a struggle like this there are guys like Liam ( John Lynch ) who just want to live their daily lives and enjoy their families ... guys that see all of the fighting just begats more fighting . There are guys like Kenny that are born leaders full of charisma , and they add fuel to the flames , rather they mean to or not . Also , Kenny genuinely believes in the " " cause " . " He believes what he is doing will make a difference in the future ... which is a bit odd ' cause his character seems too intelligent for it all . But , like a lot of other seemingly intelligent men , he is sucked into a gang lifestyle not even realizing it ... ' til it 's too late . Then there is Ginger , a pure psycho who isn 't in the fighting for any other reason but for the sheer thrill of it , which in a gangland type war makes him a valued asset , some might argue . However , now , in this film , Ginger has out lasted his worth , and has become a very dangerous loose cannon.Everything comes to a boiling point , and predictably , the ending is a tragic one . What makes this film worthy is that is shows both sides of this ages old conflict . Being American , I can 't begin to fully understand what all struggle is about . But , I do know there has to be a better way.All in all , a well acted , touching ... but troubling film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I had a great time watching Femina Ridens a couple of mornings back , somewhat hungover . For most of the film its pretty much a two hander , showing the games and weird relationship of crazy doctor Philipe Leroy and stunning Dagmar Lassander . I 'd seen her before in a couple of Fulci films dying gruesome deaths , but here she is young hip and beautiful . The film is pretty predictable and certainly mild on the exploitation front , but entertaining throughout owing too its marvellous colourful kitsch feel . The set design , music , lighting and cinematography are all classic late sixties Italian style , a surreal feast for the eyes and ears and though the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to foresee there are more than enough unusual events and memorably bizarre sights and sounds to keep things interesting throughout . Both leads are pretty good , and it bears repeating that Dagmar Lassander is really , really fine . The music , by Stelvo Cipriani is gnarly too , perfectly suited to the images . Director Pierro Schivazappa has come up with quite a cracker here , but its not perfect . Though very alluring , there 's little substance here and the exploitation elements are about as mild as can be . I guess this gives it a sort of charm and innocence but I can 't help thinking that the subject matter could have done with more sleaze , more threat , that sorta thing , especially since its pretty simple to figure whats going to happen . This is I suspect a bit pointless for stronger exploitation fans and certainly not for people wanting sex or much nudity . Its more of a light , fun pop art affair , lovable but insubstantial , like bubble bath . Recommended mainly for those fond of the 60 's , Dagmar Lassander , or sweet set designs . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Telling the story wouldn 't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens 철 , spelled almost like " " boon챕 aww " " is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people , including myself.Children 's Island is the title , and what an island . In the book , Raine , the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible . And he 's keen on breaking new records himself . In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is , as most Swedish films and books of the time , deep , consciously provocative and awe inspiring . Bergman was beginning his final film and Cries and Whispers was barely out. expectations for any Swedish film were pretty high . They taught us then that great theatre , great actors , superb writers and gifted directors made a veritable team of perfection in cinema.All this said , Barnens 횜 is a story of discovery . It is , too , a story of alienation : cities are alienating and living in one of them make us aliens to most of its residents . It is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny . It is a film of overwhelming hope and desperation . Of feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and insulation from a world that couldn 't care less ... This approach , in itself , is a pretty difficult way to weave a convincing narrative . Here , the masterful guidance of Kay Pollak on Ola Olsson 's script of P C Jersilds novel , turns it not only in a possibility , but in one of those master pieces of cinema.I may disagree a bit with someone who said that this work was all but forgotten . It is not . Even as I write this in 2009 , discussions on P C Jersild 's story are conducted all over the world , and the film shown at many film schools and small theatres.Why ? Waxing philosophical on all of it would be difficult and many have already done it scholarly through writing and lectures . The reason why Barnens 횜 was and IS a special story is the cosy feeling you get from the start when you discover that everything is told through the eyes of a small child . And that 's where it ends , too . Maybe it 's a clinical view , as someone else pointed out . But deeply disturbing , moving and satisfying . The concept is deep : as long as we have no pubic hair , we still can live one more day as an angel . Afterwards , we 'll become what Raine reflects as the colophon of his experiences : " " Men are Pigs " . " He finds his fears when he 's fearless . He finds love when the world is crumbling around him . He discovers a reason not to behave like the grown-ups because he refrains from committing crimes . He let go his inner purity and confidence in others without reservation , just to learn how rotten the soul of a man can be.Where love is expected , he finds hatred . Where compassion is needed , he finds suspicion and cold hearts . It 's a film of metaphors . A film to think and to raise questions that are hard to ask but harder to answer.In the end , the satisfaction of witnessing such a superb work ( that really upped the ante for any other Swedish film after ) is a ride of joy and hope . Be aware that it is a film full with the dark side of our nature . But , alas ! , a film of hope and deep joy . Reine will still be an Island in Stockholm , but there is the big hope of living today in full , even when we found our first signs of sexual maturity show . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy , first on ' The Daily Show ' , and then in various supporting roles . In Virgin , Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths . Carell plays Andy Stitzer , a middle aged man living a quiet , lonely life . Andy is a little odd , but in an awkward nice guy sort of way . One night , while socializing with his co-workers for the first time , Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin . His co-workers , David ( Paul Rudd ) , Jay ( Romany Malco ) , and Cal ( Seth Rogen ) initially tease Andy about his situation . But it 's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is , and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity . And so begins Andy 's quest into adulthood . Andy is the quintessential innocent , and the bulk of the humor derives from his naivet챕 to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film . Some of the humor is crude gross out stuff , but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy . In addition , I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life . I 'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama ; it 's a rolling in your seats comedy . Still , every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters . A good comparison would be ' The Wedding Crashers ' from earlier this summer . Virgin has a similar humor , but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes . I particularly loved the ending of the film , which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick . Without giving anything away , it reminded me of ' Something About Mary ' . Very light and fun ; it leaves you laughing and smiling , which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy . I would highly recommend . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The story of the boy thief of Bagdad ( as it was once spelled ) has attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924 , who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first , silent , rendering of " " Thief of Bagdad , " " to less imposing , more recent attempts . The best , however , remains 1940 's version which for its time was a startling , magical panoply of top quality special effects . Those effects still work their charm.No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief , Abu , John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch , Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier , Jaffar , played by a sinister Conrad Veidt . The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent , he and the boy , Abu , suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates . Ahmad is rendered blind and Abu becomes a lovable mutt . Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl : Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard . ( Howard , incidentally , did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film . Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry . ) Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting . Justin 's Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses . Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he 's very good . For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there 's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind . Still , I don 't think anyone under eight ought to see " " Thief of Bagdad . " " This film makes periodic appearances on TV but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present . It was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them . " " Thief of Bagdad " " is a pre-war Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases . This is one of the best of its kind.9 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In A Minute To Pray , A Second To Die , Clay McCord ( Alex Cord ) is an unhappy outlaw with a ten thousand dollar bounty on his head and degenerative epilepsy.Realizing his days as an outlaw are numbered , he wants desperately ( though somewhat reluctantly ) to take advantage of an amnesty being granted by rough and tumble territorial governor Robert Ryan , ( excellent performance ) who badly wants McCord to renounce his ways and accept the amnesty as an example to others while in the bandit hub of Escondito , outlaw Mario Brega plans to kill McCord to stop that from happening.Also starring Arthur Kennedy , Aldo Sambrell and a slew of other familiar European faces , this is co-written and produced by ( American ) spaghetti western pioneer Albert Band , also responsible for the pre-Leone film Gunfight At Red Sands.Though the solution to the main character 's " " epilepsy " " is lifted straight out of Howard Hawks ' El Dorado , the script is solid , pretty fresh and unpretentious . This has a great balance of action and story and Alex Cord is great in it . He really should have been a bigger star.In defense of the shorter ( well dubbed ) English version : personally I 'm past that age where the longer version is always the better version and the ending where McCord is ironically gunned down by grimy bounty hunters after his pardon , is needlessly nihilistic and completely destroys the film 's message about hope and redemption.Call me old-fashioned , but I rooted for McCord and felt he earned that happy ending ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" WARNING : PLOT SPOILERThe always-abnormal movies of David Cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste . Fans of his earlier films will probably like ' eXistenZ ' , but it definitely isn 't one for the squeamish . All of the usual elements are here . A game pod made out of skin ( hooked into your back ) , buckets of blood , a gun made out of bones , and a manic mechanic to name but a few . The result is good in parts , bad in parts , and just plain weird in others . But one thing the film has is undeniable originality . Despite the excessive use of혚 weirdness it does prove a point- virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people . In the movie , a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was ' annoying ' ( assuming that she was still in the game ) . But it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this stunningly life-like game . ' eXistenZ ' leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways . Despite some extra gadgets and gook , it was simply your classic ' it was all a dream혚 or was it ' twist . It is a smart surprise and answers a few questions , but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing . At only 97 minutes it could have went on a bit longer too . In a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way . Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while . But her character doesn 't have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character . Jude Law on the other hand ( equipped with a curious American accent ) is good as your average Joe sucked into this abnormal world . We see the film through his perspective . ' eXistenZ ' is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember . There 's tonnes of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of David Lynch ( what next ? - being consumed by a question mark ? ! ? ! ? ! ) .

" This has to be one of my favourite flicks , unlike the weak ' Elvira 's Haunted Hills ' ... anyway I love the way the movie is a goth / com ' Wizard of Oz ' story ... Elvira is a goth Dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a Good Witch ( elviras Aunt Morgana ) ... she inherits a " " Ruby " " ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the Bad Warlock ( Her uncle ) ... She befriends four Characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow . There is a show down with her uncle ( the wicked witch of the West ) where Elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him . In the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination Las Vegas ( Dorothy 's home in Kansas ) .There are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie ... she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters . Elvira : " " Youe must be aunt Em , and you must be uncle Remus .... There 's no place like home , there 's no place like home ! " " Bad uncle Vinny : " " I 'll get you my pretty , and your little dog too ! " " There is a sign that Elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of Kansas.But aside from this , the fact that one of the sequences she " " ripped off , um ... I mean was inspired by FlashDance " " is pure genius ... and if you don 't roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her " " very 80 's " " Las Vegas show then you haven 't got a camp bone in your body ... This movie is a Cult / Camp Classic , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I avoided watching this film for the longest time . Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped , over-blown , overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz , and I wanted nothing to do with it . I never watched it in the theatre . I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it . Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest . One of the girls spoke about this movie . " " It was so great , " " she said . " " You really felt like you were on the ship . " " " " Nonsense , " " I thought . I shared my feelings with my fellow judges . One looked at me and said , " " you might be right , but if she liked the movie that much maybe she 'll want to learn more about the real Titanic . The movie must have done something right to get her so interested . " " " " Well , maybe , " " thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV . " " OK , " " I thought , " " I 'll give it a look see . " " I didn 't want to like it - and I didn 't . I loved it ! What a great movie.Where to start ? First - the directing . My high school public speaking contestant was right . James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost " " you are there " " type of atmosphere . The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world . The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads ; then the rising sense of panic . You don 't just watch it ; you really do feel it . Then - the performances . The lead performances from Kate Winslet ( as Rose ) and Leonardo DiCaprio ( as Jack ) are excellent - Winslet 's being the superior , I thought , but both were good . They had their rich girl / poor boy characters down to a perfect " " t " " I thought . In my opinion , though , stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose 's mother . She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat , and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack . Then - the details . I 'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic , but I have a reasonable general knowledge , and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance . Very impressive , indeed . Then - the song . Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion 's performance of " " My Heart Goes On . " " Problems . Well , the romance was perhaps too contrived , in the sense that I just don 't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class . ( I know he was invited the first time ; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he 's been there for a while . ) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed , I thought , when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats . A minor quibble , though . This is truly an excellent movie . My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre , where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There has never been anything like it , that 's for sure . This episodic , seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole , and as such it is not a movie about Groovin ' Gary , Utah cross-dressing sensation . It is very self-consciously a film about how the filmmaker REACTS to Groovin ' Gary . For Harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance . He 's trying to atone for his sins - yes , Gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired - through correction , commentary , and convention , reclaiming such Hollywood-narrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending ( two different ones , with a telling adjustment in the Glover version ) and turning them to his own very personal uses . So while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference , the structure ensures that it is also a movie about MOVIES - but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity . There is just so much going on ; in telling and re-telling this story Harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row , and he doesn 't miss the opportunity to make something of it . Immensely moving , and as profound as camp ever gets . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I don 't doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Best Actor Oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the Mutiny on the Bounty leads of Clark Gable , Charles Laughton , and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race . But The Informer is still a fine film because John Ford wouldn 't have gotten his first Best Director Oscar if it wasn 't . No split involved in his award.The movie and the story by Liam O 'Flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army . He was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in . He 's down to his last pence and if he can 't get back in , wants enough for passage to America . There 's a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford . In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan constabulary and informs on McPhillip.The IRA is pretty anxious to find out who ratted McPhillip out and they 're pretty certain it was McLaglen . He hasn 't the wit to really cover his own tracks . He does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek . He also picks up a hanger-on played by J.M. Kerrigan.The whole action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning . Of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows , making it possibly the first noir thriller . Had it been done post World War II The Informer would have ranked as a great noir classic , like Odd Man Out or the The Third Man which it bares a lot of resemblance to.John Ford knew this world very well . He took some time off during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA . His real name before having it anglicized was Sean O 'Fiernan.Preston Foster plays the IRA commandant Dan Gallagher . In the book Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has him here . My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest . He makes it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informer because the Black and Tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril.The IRA trial scene is the highlight of the film . When Foster asks Donald Meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court , Meek ain 't in a position to say no . The King 's justice and writ does not run here . It graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary , the British are indeed losing their grip on the population.Of course The Informer a rather grim story has its John Ford touches , but rather fewer than you would expect . Even as McLaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree , the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing.The Informer is a tale well told about Ireland in a grim and dismal time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . I loved it then and still do . The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted " " naturally " " and you " " felt " " for them in the respective roles . A " " glossy " " film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today 's world but now the sexes are on the same level , women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past . The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January , 2005 . Pity scenes were cut prior to release - even at two hours you want more ! I have registered with Amazon for the DVD ( they do now have a special page ) . To view this film in CinemaScope after forty six years of pan and scan will be great . Twentieth Century Fox , please look further into your catalogers of fifties CinemaScope productions for DVD - there IS a large market out there .

" If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war , you need to see " " Letyat zhuravli " " ( called " " The Cranes are Flying " " in English ) . It tells the story of Veronika ( Tatiana Samoylova ) and Boris ( Aleksey Batalov ) , who are in love on the verge of WWII . They are walking along the waterfront , watching the cranes fly by , when the war starts . Boris is promptly sent off to war . Veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son , whom she does not love . Boris , meanwhile , continues trotting through the countryside , fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war , until he he runs out of energy . When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news , she refuses to accept it , until Boris ' body arrives home on one of the trains . Simultaneously , the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and the Allied Powers have won the war ; the Soviet Union lost 27 million citizens , but it 's the start of a new era.This movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield , but also how it affected the civilian population .

" The plot line is an expose of the under belly of American politics . While the theme seems common , what " " makes " " the movie is the unconventional way the story is told.The characters are played with conviction . You feel the innocence of the lead , and his innocence lost . The politician is the prince of double-talk , a real snake.The camera work is impressive . It affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue . Ditto for the music.The story uses a parable-style with vingettes where the message is filled with double-entendres . A very canny strategy by the writer / director . The tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes.The movie was like a good mystery book . Something was " " afoot " " ; you knew it was bad ; you didn 't know exactly what it could be - you had your suspicions ; and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadn 't noticed you were holding in .

" After a slow beginning , BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny film that had something positive to say . It wasn 't one of Jim Carrey 's best performances , but he was still OK . Morgan Freeman was just right as God . Jennifer Aniston had some good moments . I miss Steve Correll on " " THE DAILY SHOW ! " " I like director Tom Shadyac 's choices of movies . He also did LIAR LIAR , PATCH ADAMS , and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR . In all three of those and in Bruce Almighty , he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him . A director who knows comedy , can get the talent he gets , and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find.My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references . I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie . My guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references , but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people . That 's too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity.My Grade : 7 out of 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I cannot for the life of me understand why the rating here for this movie is so low . This was one of the most beautiful films I have seen this year . It really struck a chord with me . I had been anticipating this film for several months and I thought to myself , there 's no way it can possibly live up to the expectations I had for it ... seeing as how I built it up in my head as much as I did . Well needless to say , not only did it meet my expectations but it far surpassed them . Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were excellent in every way . Their acting superb by far . They were both in their element and completely natural for the roles . The locales were absolutely gorgeous . Every shot filmed was perfectly captured and fit the mood and atmosphere beautifully . I found this film very touching and took it very close to heart . I would even contemplate saying this could be one of my all time favorites . At the very least , certainly I could see it again and again.I swear I couldn 't find one fault in this film . It 's hard to say that about any film . I would highly recommend this one .

" I passed this one on the shelf a few times , looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes ( with tiny names ) on the front and wondering if I was missing something . The other night it was on one of the movie channels , and I tuned in . I missed nothing.I must admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes . Perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that . Given the slow , plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 , I seriously doubt it.The lead character starts the movie in classic " " I don 't know how to start my movie " " style , with a long , tiresome monologue about how he doesn 't want to get sued . It 's not funny . It 's not even remotely funny . Others have commented on the " " San Franclisco " " bit ; ok , a small chuckle the first time he says it . Then he grinds it into the ground , smiling at the camera like it 's the funniest thing ever written . Get over yourself . In fact , I think the talking to the camera bit was the reason I instantly disliked the film . Don 't assume familiarity with your audience . Familiarity is _ earned _ , much like respect.From there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp . I didn 't realize he 's Jewish ; it 's a discredit to Jewish comedians to call this " " Jewish humor " . " It 's just unfunny humor . Just because you 're Jewish doesn 't mean you have a knack for the comedy . A WASP , Spalding Gray , does a better job of self-analytical humor than this guy , so obviously it 's not about ethnicity.If one of the bits I had seen had worked , I might have stuck around . But some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with , then listing them for five long minutes , doesn 't make a great movie.This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of " " Office Space " .

" Utopia , made in 1950 in France , was the last film Laurel and Hardy produced . With the bad reputation the duo have for their post 1930 's productions I was expecting this film to be awful . Although admittedly it isn 't up to the standard of their " " vintage " " comedies I was pleasantly surprised . It 's watchable , and in parts genuinely funny ! And certainly the plot is of the same standard as you 'd expect . Some gags are derivative from their earlier work , but when you consider this film was their first for five years after their last Hollywood produced film , " " The Bullfighters " , " the routines are executed confidently as you 'd expect from these professionals . Some scenes are not up to much , but the value of this film is that some scenes are funny , and as such , absolutely priceless . I particularly enjoyed the bedtime scene.I felt sad at the end of the film . Our heros are left on their own desert island . It 's such a metaphor for the real life truth . Hollywood and audiences of the time had consigned the stars to a desert island of memories , and that was to become last image they portrayed in film . Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later . Stan turned down an offer to appear in " " It 's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World " " in 1963 . What a shame that was - a colour film , only two years before he passed . However , his health probably wasn 't up to much.These boys are probably the greatest comedy performers of all time , and although the movie is far from their true potential , it 's still an honour to watch them appear in film for the last time , and touching on the echos of their towering talent . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Just saw ' The League of Gentlemen : Apocalypse ' at a special screening in Manchester , with Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith of the League in attendance.At the back was Peter Kay ( who has a brief cameo in the film ) affectionately heckling at the back during the Q & A session after the film.The film was complicated ( in a good way ) and very very funny . It follows Geoff Tipps , Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp as they try and save fictional Rosyton Vasey from the disinterest of their creators.The League play a wide range of their characters and themselves ( or character based on themselves ) and are ably supported by the cream of British character and comedy actors such as Bernard Hill , Victoria Wood and David Warner.Warner is a particular stand out reminding me of his smooth and cutting turn in ' Time Bandits ' .The film swims in and out of various realities and allows some of the denizen 's of Rosyton Vasey some space to grow beyond their usual limits of their comedy shtick.Steve Pemberton 's Herr Lipp has a great Bretchian moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life which brings a lump to the throat at an unexpected moment and surprises you with its tender affection for the characters.This echoes something Mark and Reece said in the Q & A afterwards , that the plot of the league being tired of their famous characters is spurious and that the whole film is really a love letter to them.For a format that started as a radio character-based sketch show , these guys have really evolved the idea so far as to sustain a movie which takes you on a journey through fiction , ' reality ' , comedy , tragedy and a pleasing journey for two of the less obvious characters to carry a long form story from their 70 odd existing creations.The fans of the show will love it . It pays off dedication and attention to detail in spades , the uninitiated may be a little lost , but the joy of the LoG was always the ability to almost instantly tune into their acutely observed characters and take the stylistic leap into farce and expressionistic movie homage.There are homages a plenty in this one including ' The Shining ' and ' La Belle et la Bete ' , to name but two I spotted and they ably demonstrate their love for cinema and history with a segment in 1690 's England that makes perfect sense when you 're engaged with the movie.What can I say , I marvelled , boggled , emoted and snickered throughout and they have definitely pulled off what many have failed at . A successful British TV comedy to cinema translation.If you 've watched and enjoyed ' The League of Gentlemen ' in the past , go see it ; you will enjoy.If you haven 't , rent / buy a DVD and then go see it.Well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous Q & A. , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Good show , really good acting , and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting , unpredictable way , especially since , essentially , it 's two people in a room . It doesn 't race through like many modern films , but doesn 't drag , either . Bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the " " now " " of her character , which is still involved and not going back on her ' career ' choices - so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep , self-examination of her soul ... Brundage has the delicate balance of weight , innocence , meekness , and class to pull off ' Buddy ' very well . A bit grainy on the film quality , but it fits the tone of the story . Could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things , but definitely worth watching . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" So what constitutes a real independent film ? In a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge , I 'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy.Which is why we should be glad that films like " " Hatred of a Minute " " exist . Across the board , this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template ( indie horror film ) . Love it or hate it , " " Hatred " " isn 't afraid of being what it is , and in watching this film , you get the real sense that Kallio ( the director ) didn 't just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place , he 's in this to tell stories . Good ones . You may find this film in the horror film section of your video store , but don 't be fooled , this story is also about love , about good people pushed over the edge , and that oh-so-distant light at the end of the tunnel.If you expect smut , or an Evil Dead ripoff , stay away from this film . But if you dig the finer points of the horror / suspense genres , check this film out.Yes. Bruce Campbell did produce this movie , and I 'm sure he 's proud to tell anyone that it 's not " " Evil Dead " . " Bruce has never tried to bank on his " " ash " " image , and it 's obvious that he didn 't get involved with " " Hatred " " so that it could do so either.My advice , though , to all Dead-ites rabidly devouring anything issued by Mr. Campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you.The acting is well done , although nothing about this film is oscar caliber ( perhaps intentionally ) , it 's good to see compassionate performances in a horror film . So often , actors in films such as these don 't even seem to try , with " " Hatred " , " it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously , never resorting to typical horror-film campiness.Technically , " " Hatred " " is about as competent as indie film gets . The editing is fast paced , the cinematography is good given the budget , and " " Hatred " " keeps a quick pace , without any bog-down points or bad anti-climaxes.All in all , Hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi-million dollar fake indies , but personally , I don 't see a problem with that . It 's a film by folks who actually care about the medium . People who reached into thier broke ass pockets , pulled out thier nickles and dimes , threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie.Check this one out . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" A film with very little positive to say for it.Firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama.Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again . I lost count of how many times I had seen " " that " " field at night or that bit of cracked earth.It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don 't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused . So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it 's fine . We find Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre . Beth has a key to a warehouse of books ? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie , much later , in fact too late.And on the point of the acre . Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary 혯 and also if they 're meant to be an acre big then make them so.There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as Beth ( the best performer in the piece , followed by Jefferson 혯 the cop ) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on " " medication " . " With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child ( did he crawl out of the window ? He 's six months old ) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene .

To his credit the " " opponent " " nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously ( Luzhin has taken a flyer out a window--sad , but so releasing to him ) by way of the unstable genius ' widow ( Emily Watson . ) In death , then , because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master , Luzhin 's defence ( which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity ) is allowed to be played . The Italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant . Talk about a dramatic " " end game ! " " , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" To get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track , not only the music , but the way all sounds help to weave the imagery . How beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of Gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity ! Note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside Giovanna 's marriage . Don 't expect to find much here of the political life of Italy in 1943 . That 's not what this is about . On the other hand , if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds , you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo-realism . By the end of the film we there are moments Antonioni-like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places . This is one of my favorite Visconti films . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was expecting this to be just like the others , tries to be scary- ends up looking silly . Somewhere along the line the writers must have realised this and so took the film in a totally different direction basically ignoring the other films . This feels like a different film rather than the fourth entry in the Child 's Play series . The new idea works making this the best in the series by far . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I first saw this movie I was with my dad . He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites . After watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites . A River Runs Through It is about two brothers who each take a different path in life . Norman Maclean ( Craig Sheffer ) is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education . Paul Maclean ( Brad Pitt ) is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles . The movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path.There is no downside to this movie . You will be entertained the whole way through . The acting , directing , and script is all perfect . The two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score . Both of which entrap you in the world Robert Redford creates for you . This is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic . It sure is in my book . If you haven 't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a film that I love above all others . I try to revisit the main film locations in Oakworth and Oxenhope whenever I can , which help to re-establish those magical qualities that this film seems to embody so uniquely - recalling a gentler and more mannered age , with its unspoken assertions that people really do matter , that family life is not just another disposable , and that life really is worth living ( though sometimes , we may doubt that ) . In short , a film that soon brings tears to my eyes , helped perhaps by the deeply evocative music - some tunes are jaunty ( like the Perks ' tune , played on a trombone , sometimes with spoons ) , the stirring melody when the family first set off for Yorkshire not knowing what lies ahead , and the haunting little tune played on a solo clarinet ( or is it an oboe ? ) that precedes sudden child-felt changes in fortune.This is as much a film for adults as for children , appealing to the eternal child in us all - a key that effortlessly reactivates those deep and apparently long-lost values and feelings buried inside us , which are normally swept aside by the demands of modern everyday life . This is a film about basic human goodness and decency in which we the viewers are left to make of it what we will , and there are welcome touches of humour sometimes added for good measure , such as the arrival of the aunt or , on a more earthy level , the bedroom scene on Perks ' birthday - " " All right Bert - as it 's your birthday ! " " I must know every scene , every line of this film , and yet so great is the magic that each time I watch , it is like I am opening a box of delights for the first time , savouring each moment - sometimes humorous , sometimes .... well , very different . As Peter says in the film : " " it 's perfect - more perfect than you know " . " And so it is ! ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read . A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read . " " -Mark Twain 'Classic ' seems to be the word used to describe " " Scarface " , " Brian DePalma 's 1983 film about opulence , self surrender , greed , and danger among Florida 's drug ring . People and critics ( and rappers for that matter ) deem this film ' an epic gangster classic ' or ' eptiome of gangster films . ' When it is anything but . It is praised for all the wrong reasons . Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over , but not all the praise it gets from audiences today , and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.First off , the film is about a Cuban refugee , with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness . Simple ? Yes . But the layers of De Palma 's directing genius , and the great story written by Oliver Stone ( yes I know , he actually wrote a real good one here ) play into all of it . The characters are all looking for an escape , as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all . Each character has something to offer , that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film . They are entwined in a world of mystique and money , but all that has a price , as they all learn . Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life , when in true dramatic irony , they are actually getting worse . ' Tragedy ' would be a better word to describe this movie . All those who praise the film for it 's drug usage , it 's violence , it 's dialog , totally missed the point . There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves . And that is why the film works so well . The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film , not to look cool or attract viewers . Brian De Palma doesn 't make movies for cult gangsters , or brainless action fans.Next on , the film is an adult drama . It is not a ' gangster film ' . It has it 's share of action , but the action is plotted very carefully , so it has a point . It 's not like " " Aliens " " - an example of a big dumb action film , and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people . Ridiculous . Hogwash . If this film is about that , then it is about how bad it is . Not a promotion of it . This being said , the film is indeed a great film . It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story . It has a very dramatic score ( in true Giorgio Moroder style ) , which simply could give you chills , or bring you to tears . The film is rather lengthy , but it is a story , and each moment counts . The acting is terrific . Al Pacino - enough said . He can do any role that he puts his mind to , and this was no exception . Pretty boy Steven Bauer , as Manny . I didn 't think much of him in other films he did , but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma 's direction . Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira . Popping ' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in " " Grease 2 " " she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye . But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony 's sister Gina , who when she smiles , or cries , we see her soul and her fresh way of living , and watch it deteriorate ; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa , a drug lord , who runs deeper than a river , and Shenar portrays him as so ; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina 's torn mother . These three dig the film as deep as it can go . This reviewer learned one main thing when watching " " Scarface " " for the first time . Always go into a film unsuspecting . All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see . Only knowing De Palma ( like I do ) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds . So ignore the rap crap , ignore the mindless violence supporters , and fix yourself a glass of Bailey 's on the rocks , and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film , the real " " Scarface . " " , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was the first " " Walking Tall " " movie I saw , I think in a $ 2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd . , so I didn 't have any reference to the first installment done by Joe Don Baker . I remember being shocked at the corrupted system of McNairy County and the brutality of the " " redneck gangs " . " I was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he 's not going to let it slide , and went out to do something about it . Courageous ? I thought so - to a point where it sent shivers up my spine.I think this movie is a great story about American courage to stand up and do something about a system that 's only serving its own interest . I was pretty blown away about it , and think this is still one of the best movie of the hero / anti-hero genre , which one might laugh but includes recent movies like the " " The Punisher " , " but even more so because it 's a true story . The recent remake starring the " " Rock " " just doesn 't do any justice to the real fire in the story of Buford Pusser.A " " classic " " that I 'm sure will resurface again in the future . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched this movie when I was almost quite a kid , and , naturally , was moved to tears by this story of a fox family . The fantastic scenery at Hokkaid척 , the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists .

" Sure , this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clich챕s , but it 's entertaining , and that 's what I watch movies for . To be entertained . Natasha Henstridge is stunning , even with the short hair . Her smile is radiant and her beauty can 't be disguised . As for Michael Vartan , I 'm sure the women love him . The two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film . I don 't understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them . I guess we see what we want to see.Olivia d 'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun to watch , even if d 'Abo 's British accent did creep into her supposed Bronx speech . To tell you the truth I hadn 't really noticed it until I read these comments , but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American to me , but she was ideal for her role with that one exception . It 's a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others , but who find their soul mates in one another . It may be an unlikely story , but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries ? It is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube . That 's why we watch them , to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen . I thought these actors did a good job of it , but hey , I 'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily . Don 't get me wrong though , it has to be a sentimental scene , and this movie had plenty of those.I give it 9 / 10 only because I 'm saving my 10 / 10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that I know will come along some day . If you see it advertised as coming up on the Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies , or whatever , make a note to watch it . I think you 'll like it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was not expecting much from this movie , but was very pleasantly surprised , as it is light and funny and very well observed . The central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug-centred trip to Wales . The humour was gentle and subtle , as indeed were the three characters ( witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper ) . The atmospherics of rural Wales were captured perfectly , and the soundtrack was very well chosen . Cleverly and carefully scripted , with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture - I felt I was there with them . Very light in touch and full of fun - not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs . A delight on all fronts , and difficult to criticise , though I thought the last two scenes were a bit lame - the film should have ended when they left Wales . But overall , an unexpected treasure of a film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is probably one of the best French movies I had seen in a very long time ! This " " pastiche " " or parody of spy movies is very well made and is going to make you laugh from the beginning to the end . Some references to today 's world are very subtle . The whole Maroccan context of the movie is to be understood in light of today 's French culture / environment . That said , all the jokes and - seemingly - shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context , are permitted and accepted because this is a parody . I was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that I should go too and assured me that I was going to have a great time , and indeed I had ! If you liked the old 007 movies with Sean Connery and also like movies like Airplane or Hot Shots , you will be delighted . I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the US ...

There 's never a moment when you think oh , I 'm watching a movie and she 's an actress . She 's too damn real for words.In fact there 's 2 scenes that I 'm still giggling over , and I won 't give them away , but in one she 's in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how " " awesome " " it is . ( I almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing ! ! ! ) In another she talks about a teenagers definition of " " sex " " versus an adults , and if it isn 't the truest dialog I 've heard in a movie in a long time , I don 't know what is . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A heroic young trail scout leads a large party of pioneers along THE BIG TRAIL to the West , with Indian attacks , natural disasters & romantic complications all part of the adventure.As sweeping & magnificent as its story , Raoul Walsh 's THE BIG TRAIL is a wonderful film , as entertaining as it was more than seven decades ago . With very good acting and excellent production values , it lives up to its reputation as the talkies ' first epic Western.John Wayne , pulled from obscurity for his first important movie role , looks impossibly young , but he immediately impresses with the natural charm & masculine authority he brings to the hero 's role ; he quietly dominates the film with the attributes which would someday make him a huge star . Marguerite Churchill is fetching as a lovely Southern belle who slowly warms to the Duke 's attentions . Dialect comic El Brendel is great fun as a Swedish immigrant beset with mule & mother-in-law woes ; his appearance in a scene signals laughs for the viewer.Looking & sounding like a human grizzly bear , Tyrone Power Sr. , vast & repulsive , makes a wonderful villain . Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated bad guy . ( His famous physical similarity to John Gilbert is very apparent here . ) Silent movie character actor Tully Marshall is impressive as a wily old mountain man who helps guide the wagon train . Corpulent Russ Powell , as a friendly fur trapper , puts his vocal talent for making nonsense noises to good use . Sharp-eyed movie mavens will spot Ward Bond as one of the Missouri settlers.What will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was filmed in an early wide screen process , called Grandeur . More than living up to its name , the picture looks marvelous , with Walsh showing a mastery of the new technology . He fills the screen , every portion of it , with action . Notice during the crowd scenes , how everyone is busy doing real work , which adds so much to the verisimilitude of these sequences . Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen . In addition , the film is blessedly free of the rear projection photography which blights so many older films . It should also be stressed that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a little primitive ; talkies were still in their cradle . That Walsh was able to use a microphone at all , with most of the scenes shot out of doors , is more kudos for him.THE BIG TRAIL was not a box office success . In 1930 , William Haines ' comedies were the big money makers and the public was looking for fare other than intelligent Westerns . Most of the cast slipped into obscurity , including Wayne . It would not be until 1939 , when John Ford rescued him in STAGECOACH , that John Wayne 's legend would begin in earnest . And despite its grand & sweeping vistas , it would be another 25 years before wide screen caught on with Hollywood , largely as an answer to the economic threat from television . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you " " get it " , " it 's magnificent.If you don 't , it 's decent.Please understand that " " getting it " " does not necessarily mean you 've gone through a school shooting . There is so much more to this movie that , at times , the school shooting becomes insignificant.Above all , it 's a movie about acceptance , both superficially--of a traumatic event , but also of people who are different for whatever reason.It 's also a movie about unendurable pain , and how different people endure it . In this case , the contrast between Alicia 's rage and Deanna 's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat . Thankfully , the audience is given credit for being human beings ; our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy , implausibly moralistic ending.Above and beyond that , I try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that . Yet I must admit , I cried like a lost little baby during this movie . There were certain things about it that hit * very * close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed . But that is not necessarily a bad thing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A couple ( Janet and Richard ) go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp . After camping and enjoying nature , the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house . Soon , a pair of escaped convicts show up and , after much delaying of the inevitable , they proceed to rape Janet and lock Richard in a birdcage.This LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT-like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made . It 's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers . Moreover , I found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it 's perverse tone . I love CAGED TERROR . The music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty . I found the film to be quite creepy.The flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film , which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering . While I didn 't mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question , I do think that it will both most people . The acting isn 't too good nor is the dialogue , at least in the early scenes . This film takes a little more patience than usual , and it 's really not for everyone.In short , this was a good film . Not the greatest horror film I 've ever seen , but it is certainly a lot of fun . It 's not exactly the easiest film to find . It 's possible to find it in the USED section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough . It 's not for everyone , but if you 're a fan of trash cinema then it 's definitely worth checking out . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What a lovely heart warming television movie . The story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope .

" After the success of " " Muppet Babies " " Warner Brothers chalked up " " Tiny Toons " . " But instead of making Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck and all the rest of the Looney Toon gang kids , they created new animal characters who were kids with their own distinct personalities but personalities that nonetheless mirrored their predecessors . The leads included Buster & Babs Bunny ( no relation , which became their running gag or catch phrase ) , Plucky Duck , Hampton Pig , Dizzy Devil , Shirley ' the ' Loon , Elmira , Montana Max , Furball , Sweety , the rats and assorted animals of Perfecto Prep , and the original Looney Toons cast themselves . The " " Tiny Toons " " lived in Acme Acres and attended Acme Looniversity , where the Looney Toon gang worked as teachers who served as mentors to the younger generation the ins and out of comedy.During the show 's run , various pot shots were taken at the Bush SR. administration , pop culture , and coupled with various other gags and spoofs.Buster & Babs , arguably the show 's main characters , as mentioned above , were similar to Bugs Bunny in some respects , but they also had their own differing personality ticks and comic styles , namely , Babs ' tendency to impersonate anyone and everyone , while Buster , capable of being a great goof himself , usually played straight man ( or straight rabbit ) to Babs ' antics . Plucky Duck was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck ( not screwball Daffy but egomaniac Daffy ) , with nearly as big an ego as Daffy and just as much of an obsession with upstaging the Buster & Babs as Daffy had with upstaging Bugs , though he usually fell flat on his face in his attempts , yet he remained strangely endearing through out . Hampton was an even more shy version of Porky Pig , and he had the thankless job of playing Porky to Plucky 's Daffy . Shirley , the blond duck gal , was a new age valley girl type whom Plucky would go in and out of phases of mocking or vying for her affections . Dizzy was the purple version of the Tasmanian Devil . Furball was the silent Sylvester and Sweety was the pink Tweetie bird . There was also the purple female skunk who longed for a boyfriend and the pint sized versions of Wile Coyote and the Road Runner . Evil was defined in the form of Montana Max , a rich kid who was always out to make a buck or make people 's lives miserable . There was also Elmira , a deranged animal lover whom everyone feared . And then there was Godo Dodo , an odd thing-a-ma-gig creature who had no clearly designated species except that he was from " " Wacky Land " " or something like that.Pop culture references included Batman ( quite frequently actually ) , Michael Jackson , Vanilla Ice , Dances With Wolves , Indiana Jones , Star Trek , Supergirl , fast food joints , the Ten Commandments , the Twilight Zones , Saturday Night Live and even the Simpsons , among others.Not only funny , but it also managed to be warm and touching , something it 's successor " " Animaniacs " " never quite attained .

" I consider myself a casual fan of Dario Argento . For every really good flick by him ( such as " " Deep Red " " and " " Tenebre " " ) , there seems to be one that 's equally uninspired ( his output since " " Opera " " has tended to disappoint ) . Still , there 's no denying that when he 's at his best , there are few horror directors who can top him . I consider " " Opera " " to be Argento 's finest work.This is definitely the film where all of his trademarks are present . There 's no well-developed characters and the plot makes very little sense once you begin to scrutinize it . Still , think of Argento as an European equivalent of Brian DePalma - the style is all that matters here , so much it becomes the substance . Typical to Argento , there 's some beautifully filmed murder sequences . Those unfamiliar with the man 's work may perceive that as a sadistic remark ( and it may be , considering the often time misogyny of them ) , but its really true . Argento stages murder with an intricacy to eye-popping visual detail . He truly makes graphic violence an art form . Plus , his direction and the look of his films is impeccable.Fortunately , " " Opera " " is one of his most frightening products . Argento is the only director whom I feel booming rock music works well for horror sequences ( when others attempt to pull it off , it comes across as cheesy ) . The acting varies , with Cristina Marsillach playing a beautiful and reasonably sympathetic but never particularly animate young opera performer . The rest of the actors are workmanlike and get the job done , but again , with Argento , the acting is never the point . Its the beautiful colors , the terrifying violence , and the overall fever dream / nightmare atmosphere . ( 9 / 10 ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I first saw Rob Roy twelve years ago . With little money for entertainment , I rented it for my fianc챕 and I to watch on a bone chilling winter 's night . The movie I had wanted was gone , so I rented this instead , not expecting much , and was very much surprised with how good it was . I just recently watched it again , and loved it every bit as much as the first time . For those unfamiliar with the story , it 's about Scottish outlaw Robert Roy MacGregor , a cattleman and folk hero . From the little I know about the man and his story , liberties have been taken with the facts , but it 's a movie , not a textbook , and so the filmmakers can be excused . Basically , the plot of the movie is that Rob Roy borrows money from the Marquis of Montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from . But , his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest . Our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the Marquis , and Mary , his wife , suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of Archibald Cunningham , a smarmy Englishman with no soul . Atrocities ensue , until , in an immensely satisfying conclusion , Rob carves Archibald up like a Christmas turkey . There are many great performances in this movie , but allow me to touch specifically on a few . Liam Neeson , as usual , is fantastic , a sexy beast you can 't take your eyes off of . Honestly , this man is like ice cream : even when he 's bad he 's good . His Rob Roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him , in the best way he knows how . Jessica Lange , as Mary , gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering , dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure . You just know she doesn 't take any b.s from Rob , or anyone else for that matter . Tim Roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil Archibald , yet somehow , it works . All the posturing and preening , combined with some wicked dialogue , result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory . Combine all of this , and the stellar work by other supporting players , with the luscious scenery of Scotland , and you have what amounts to one really , really cool movie . If you haven 't seen this , I highly recommend that you do . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I loved this film , at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but I quickly got into it . There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and I really admire the work done in cutting it down . If you 're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here , ( and some real tossers ) . Technically I liked it a lot too , they must have used a new de-interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but I wasn 't annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers . ( Open Water drove me nuts , mostly because there are cheap , progressive cameras available now and I see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema ) . Sorry that 's my own little rant . I definitely recommend this film if you 've ever been involved with the music scene , it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious , I might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it 's a classic piece . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of Hitchcock 's lesser known films , because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden Hitchcock gem or a true Hitchcock great or some other generic if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc . So , that being said , I would just like to say that if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc.Now , that may be overshooting a little bit , The Ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above , but compared to the other films that Hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s , I really think that The Ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them . As an almost brand new director , there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why Hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career.Granted , the film does start with , among other things , the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer ( and I use idiot in the definitive manner , the way Stephen King so often does ) having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people . I suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then , but I think it is one of the most off-putting sequences in any Hitchcock film I 've seen.The main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round , but when he meets his match , it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife 's finger . So begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman , who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly . ( spoilers ) There is , for example , a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and , just before going into the building , she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss . This kiss is never explained , and there is also the fact that , even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband , or at least ultimately chooses him , they look into each other 's eyes but do not actually kiss.The film is certainly beautifully photographed , even more so than several films that Hitch released in subsequent years . There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as One Round Jack 's trainer who , in his stone faced expressionism , reminds me quite often of the brilliant Buster Keaton . Hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous , but this is a great sample of his early work . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" You know , Robin Williams , God bless him , is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade ( with perhaps the exception of " " Death To Smoochy " , " which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic ) . The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic , especially " " Insomnia " " and " " One Hour Photo " . " " " The Night Listener " , " despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release , is among his best work , period.This is a very chilling story , even though it doesn 't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter . The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed . In high school , I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson , who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result . I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist . When I saw this movie , the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic " " caretaker " . " Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like " " Little Miss Sunshine " . " There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me . It takes a good actress to play that sort of role , and it 's this understated ( yet well reviewed ) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award ( as of 2008 ) . It 's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this , and it 's scary too.This is a good , dark film that I highly recommend . Be prepared to be unsettled , though , because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I can 't praise this film enough . It had a lot of that hand-held , first-person shaking camera which I love ( and some hate , because it makes them sick ) , like REC , Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project.It is a long movie for its kind , but I didn 't even notice because the film was so interesting . By just showing the footage from a paranormal reporter 's work the movie keeps up the pace , making it a real-time experience for the viewer.While I would never call this film the " " scariest horror ever made " , " I 'd have to say it 's certainly one of the best I 've seen . The fear factor here is constructed by details in the images , camera glitches , events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie . The horror is more in what is not shown , but left to our imaginations . The ending is perfect , and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards . A second viewing is highly recommended , though.Watch this one alone in the dark , don 't expect anything and you 'll have fun . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Recently released on British DVD , this is a good movie ( as long as you have an attention span and IQ of more than a fruit fly ) . Not as depressing as it could have been , this is kitchen-sink at its most dirty . Terrance Stamp is great in it , the music is sweet , Carol White is very believeable as the single mum tart who can 't stop loving criminals.My favourite scene is where Carol and her friend who works in the pub with her ( the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye ) sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk past.The only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of Carol 's first husband , but if you can get past that , you 're OK . And Donovan provides some of the most languid , mellow , bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" With Ralph Bakshi most of his films appear to be like two-edged swords . You 'll get something awesome out of it but only if you put up with the silly and the unnecessarily cheezy . The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story which perhaps didn 't always shine in the animation department.Fire and Ice is a great achievement from Bakshi from an animation point of view . The rotoscoping is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look to it . You still get some of the dull still-cells and slightly blurred background paintings but on the over-all the look has definitely gotten better since Bakshi 's last fantasy epic . The animation has almost a realistic-naturalistic style to it , and unlike in LOTR where this style was often at odds with the actual content , here it enhances the film 's unique atmosphere.Unfortunately the film fails to create a meaningful story out of its simple setting and in fact most of the characters ' motivations are pretty blurred . Lorn and Tigra are easy cases but even the main villain Necron was difficult to follow not to mention That Guy with Furry Face Mask ( also known as just ' That Guy ' ) . Even though most of the voice actor 's were appropriate , there are some odd quirks in the audio-department and Tigra especially sounds really terrible whenever she 's screaming.However , I believe the film 's inherent entertainment value outweighs its unnecessarily silly execution of the plot-line . The scant clad of the characters is something you 'll never get over but it helps you remind yourself that perhaps this film isn 't even intended to be taken too seriously . It 's still a hella cool and really funny . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Visconti 's first feature , Ossessione is an adaptation of James M. Cain 's The Postman Always Rings Twice . Now , I 'm not familiar with that book or the other film versions , but I am a big fan of Cain 's Double Indemnity ( much more so than I am a fan of Billy Wilder 's film version of it , in fact ) . The two novellas seem like they must be very similar . Both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her . Giovanna , the woman in this Italian version , played very well by Clara Calamai , is not evil incarnate like the wife in Double Indemnity , but she seems very spoiled . Her husband ( a great performance by Juan de Landa ) is a bit cruel to her , but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him . He 's older than her and unattractive , so she 's rather fickle . When Gino shows up , a young , muscular man , it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed . She sweats she wants to be with him forever , but she 's stuck with her husband . They break up at first , but when they meet again , they ( apparently , although this is intentionally vague ) plan to murder the husband . They are successful , and they move back to the woman 's home town to run the bar that her husband owned . Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea . He wants Giovanna , but the one thing that he certainly doesn 't want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life . Their relationship quickly crumbles . Ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters . It 's always fascinating , but it does go on a bit too long . At two hours and twenty-two minutes , I can 't , for the life of me , figure out how it took that long ! This is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that Visconti was inventing within this film . It was , after all , the first film that won that label . We see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life , without any hurrying to the next plot point . I 've seen many of Visconti 's films , and the only one I like better than this one is Rocco and His Brothers ( 1960 ) . His direction is as great as it ever was , with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect . I also feel the need to point out the film 's best performance , by Dhia Christiani as a young ( exotic ) dancer and part-time prostitute named Anita whom Gino meets after he begins to try to break away from Giovanna . She 's only in the film for maybe five or six minutes , and she has only a few lines . It 's shocking how much Visconti and Christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time . She 's absolutely heartbreaking . 9 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Radio was not a 24 hour 7days a week happening when I grew up in the 1930s England , so Children 's Hour was a treat for me when we had batteries and an accumulator to spare for the power . The few programmes I heard therefore made a great impression on my young mind , and the 3 that I recall still are " " Toytown " , " one about all the animals at the Zoo , and --- Grey Owl , talking about the animals he knew , which he called his " " brothers " . " It was only in recently that I learnt that Grey Owl wasn 't a genuine " " Indian " , " but the tribute paid by the Sioux Chief makes great sense to me " " A man becomes what he dreams " . " Would that we could all dream as world changing and beneficial as Archie Grey Owl Belaney . Would that a new Grey Owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made . Amitabh as a country bumpkin , Arjun Singh , is hilarious . The best thing is the laughter never stops . The plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end . There are villains ( Ranjit ) and there are brothers ( Sashi Kapoor ) and there are vixens ( Parveen Babhi ) and there are lovers ( Smita Patil ) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure . But this movie is about Amitabh and thats all you remember at then end.Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious . Later in the movie he turns into the Angry Young Man he is famous for but the humour stays . Memorable parts include his walking , talking and speaking english , the song ( pad gungaroo re bhand , meera nachi thi ) and everything with his dadoo.All in all I was rolling with laughter throughout the movie . If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at his absolute best - this is it . It will easily give it a 10 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again . Michael Keaton is put in charge of wooing a Japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of Hadleyville . What happens after that is one hilarious moment after another . The two cultures clash and it is up to Keaton to hold things together . Look for great performances from Keaton , Gedde Watanabe , George Wendt , Mimi Rogers , John Turturro , Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo . All are perfectly cast . Don 't be fooled by the low number rating . This is a 7.5 in my book . It is interesting to note that the town name of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon . Yes , there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I love the Thackeray novel on which this film is based . And while this modern version of Becky Sharp 's story is a B film , the casting of Loy , in her first top-billed role , is rather fascinating.Before Loy became MGM 's reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles , she was an actress . VANITY FAIR was Loy 's follow-up film to EMMA , in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper ( Marie Dressler ) .Loy 's Becky is much nastier than Miriam Hopkins ' version 3 years later in BECKY SHARP . Loy 's Becky is very much a pre-Code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways . It 's the type of character that Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could easily have played , but Becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set . That 's what makes her fallen character so tragic.In counterpoint to Loy 's grasping Becky is the goody goody Amelia ( Barbara Kent ) who is just not an interesting character . Mary Forbes is icily good as Mrs. Sedley . Most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah : Conway Tearle as Rawdon ; Walter Byron as Osborne ; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin . Others are nearly Dickensian is their quirkiness : Billy Bevan as Joseph ; Lionel Belmore as Crawley ; Montagu Love as the Marquis ; Lilyan Irene as Polly the maid ; Elspeth Dudgeon as the housekeeper.Loy is front and center throughout . While the ending is rather shocking , she has several excellent scenes , such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman 's winning roulette bet . The more Loy 's Becky descends morally , the more beautiful she gets until she is finally " " caught . " " Bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by Loy in a film that should be seen . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " The Plainsman " " represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its most inaccurate and un-factual . It sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok ( Gary Cooper ) , Buffalo Bill Cody ( James Ellison ) , Calamity Jane ( Jean Arthur ) , George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact , even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place . Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth , but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship . The film is an attempt to buttress Custer 's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people , who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends . Truly , this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment , but a pretty campy relic by today 's standards.TRANSFER : Considering the vintage of the film , this is a moderately appealing transfer , with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks . There 's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments . All in all , the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent , but it is never all bad or all good 혯 just a bit better than middle of the road . Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract . The audio is mono but nicely balanced.EXTRAS : Forget it . It 's Universal ! BOTTOM LINE : As pseudo-history painted on celluloid , this western is compelling and fun . Just take its characters and story with a grain of salt 혯 in some cases 혯 a whole box seems more appropriate ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" At first I wasn 't sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so I looked it up on IMDb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so I thought I would give it a try expecting a movie like Elephant.Once I got past the fact that I am supposed to dislike the Alicia character played excellently by Busy Phillips , I realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between Alicia and Deanna . Alicia is so mean to Deanna played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting . They share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses.I 've just got to say how much I loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it . I couldn 't even get through Elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the Columbine tragedy . This movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic . Busy Phillips acting is OFF the CHAIN ! ! ! That is a good thing and I would love to see her progress into some more mature roles . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I got this as part of a competition prize . I watched it , not really expecting much from an obviously low budget production . I laughed myself sick ! There are obvious references to other films in the horror genre - Texas Chain Saw Massacre , Friday 13th etc . All the standard clich챕s were there - long drive through partially arid and somehow menacing countryside , inbred red-necks , mysterious vehicles tracking you - throw in some really good humorous scenes ( siphoning petrol from the camper-van ) and dialogue ( " " f * * * * * g virgin ? That 's got to be an oxymoron .. " " and you have one of the best spoof horror films for years .

" Allow yourself to be transported to a different , old school kind of storytelling . Scoop is classic Woody Allen.Allen 's latest muse , Scarlett Johansson ( who also appeared in last year 's Match Point , also by Allen ) , is surprisingly able to tone down her sultry sex kitten appeal and transform into a normal looking student-type with the aid of nerdish glasses and outfits but still fails to make the audience believe how Hugh Jackman 's lordly character can be so smitten by her , given the royal 's background ( don 't worry , no spoilers here ) . There are no grand transformations for Johansson 's character here , as she consistently plays the same character throughout despite the script saying otherwise . You even forgive her character 's apparent lack of logic , continuing an affair with a suspected serial killer , simply because he is His Royal Hotness Jackman , who is refreshing to see sans the Wolverine duds.If anything , consistency is what the 70-year old Allen is all about . He continues to tell his stories on celluloid in the same way he always has ; as if he 's never been exposed to modern film-making , which is probably what makes his quiet , simple films appealing . They never seem to aim for a specific market ; as if Allen makes movies to his taste alone , whether the public likes it or not . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well I don 't personally like rap , but I still found Fear of a Black Hat hilarious . I 'm sure I didn 't get some inside jokes , but some I knew , and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after I 'd stopped laughing . I 'm a big fan of Spinal tap , so naturally I had to check this out . It was deriviative from This Is Spinal Tap , sometimes blatantly , but this film still stood on it 's own as an original , intelligent , and funny satire .

" Although Kurt Russell was and is probably the closest person to look like Elvis in show-business , so many things were false in this film . First of all , the makers claimed Elvis opened his famous live shows in ' 69 after a 9 year hault for films by wearing a white jump-suit made in 1972 . Also they claimed he sang ' burning love ' which he first sung in 1972 and ' the wonder of you ' which he first recorded in 1970 .

Of course , the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive . But it still is captivating and interesting .

" In the hands of lesser actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan this film could have become silly and trite . But , with these two experienced thespians leading the way , I found " " Silent Fury " " to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery . When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married , and that he was best man at that wedding , one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work . As Colbert , Ryan , and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage , they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed . Although it 's not very difficult to figure out just who the main " " baddie " " is , it 's still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story increases .

" I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting " " guess who " " game . The movie , however , needs more Robin in it . He appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest . I always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new Robin character , let alone Knightwing . This movie just continues that bad tradition . The movie spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance which wouldn 't be so bad in one movie if the romance wasn 't so unbelievable .

" This is unlike any other movie , the closest thing I can compare it to is a Woody Allen film ... But where as Woody Allen is constantly fathoming human foibles Bret Carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse . In the Case of Lou , it is the root cause of his stuttering , which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs.There are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and I believe they all deserve a chance for redemption , although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place , so maybe we shouldn 't fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or Breasts.This is an indie film shot on a long shoestring , but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film . I feel like its a quirky Gem for the self-help market . I really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next , i could imagine a career along the lines of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks , although usually when a guy like this breaks through , he goes off and makes " " X MEN " " and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they .... X Men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly : ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre , which is my favorite genre of them all , so when I saw it was Free on Demand , I had to watch it ! It stars Caroline Munro , from both Dr. Phibes films ( she was his wife that died ! ) , Dracula A.D. 1972 , The Golden Voyage of Sinbad , Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter , The Spy Who Loved Me , Maniac , and Faceless.Brought to you by the people behind Don 't Open Til Christmas and Pieces , Heres my thoughts on this ... It opens on April Fools Day , where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower , and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet ( all while hes naked ! ) . The coach puts a stop to it , but both parties swear revenge . But , the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive.Cut to the future , and its th High School reunion , or so they think ( bwahahha ? ) . The only ones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid , and its April Fools Day ( or really , the day before April Fools , but the fun starts at midnight ) , yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall . Then they finally break into the school and it starts storming.Inside they find food / drink and a little shrine for each of them , each of their lockers and belongings , along with Marty 's ( the nerds ) locker and yearbook . They also find the old black janitor / caretaker who spends his time saying " " Oooh yesser ! Yesser ! I don 't want no trouble , sir ! " " and then is killed instantly . Pretty pointless character , but hes still my favorite.The movie takes a page out of Alien 's book , in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see ! Thats when everyone realizes that they 're there to die , and they start freaking out , except for Shirley , who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this . Of course , it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off ( very cool , mind you ) The rest of the night goes as usual , sex , drugs , and Marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask .. Whats their plan ? " " All we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon . Marty wont kill us during mid-day ! " . " Seriously , thats what he said . Apparently you can only kill at nighttime . But will they survive through the night ? Who will live and who will die ? And why are all the bodies disappearing ? Rent , buy , or steal this great movie to find out ! The movie is actually very good , filled with clich챕s ( car wont start , DAMMIT ! ) and just plain slasher fun . Not to mention they all have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan . I recommend it to all of you ! And , not to mention , it has a Spin Off ! 1989 's Cutting Class is a spin-off from this slasher gem , and that movie starts the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell.Favorite scene : 2 people having sex , the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn 't . " " Talk dirty to me , Frank ! ! " " she screams " " Uh ... tits ! " " " " DIRTIER ! " " " " Uh ... tits . F * ck. tits . Boobs . F * ck . " .

" MPAA Rating PG-13My Rating : 10 and upMy * Rating 9.5 / 10William H. Macy delivers a stunning performance as the role of Mr. Neuman . He makes you feel sympathetic and scared for him simultaniously . The story starts out as a comedy and slowly but steadily becomes almost like a horror film with twists and turns that Macy effortly masters . I couldn 't take my eyes off this film even after it ended , and I couldn 't beleive it ended when it did . A MUST TO SEE.THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER BY SOMEAfter you watch the film , look at the plot this way : The Neumans are the United States as a whole , and the charactor Meat Loaf Aday plays is the people in the United States who are anti-Semetic.This was a very enjoyable film and would reccomend to anyone I saw in the street . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Spoilers ! Classic 70 's sex trash ! The Swedish gal ( Helga ) was what made this movie so great . She was beautiful , but what really got to me was how sexual she was . She exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film . Her best scenes were when she was , er , stimulating herself . Whenever she was on screen , I became transfixed.Also , the Doctor Julia ( sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film ) was very interesting visually . Although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than Julia , she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes ( especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt ) also grabbed my attention unmercilessly . You also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid ; I don 't know if I 've ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time .

" Alex Benedict ( John Cassavetes ) is an orchestra conductor having an secret affair with his pianist . When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he doesn 't leave his wife , he sees he has no choice but to murder her and make it look as if she had committed suicide . Too bad for him our rumpled detective , Lt. Columbo ( Peter Falk ) , is on the case.Stephen Bochco has written another razor-sharp episode for the series , following marvelous detail with marvelous detail . We watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty-five minutes , and we 're completely engrossed . Then when Columbo appears on the scene , it gets even better.We first see Columbo after the murder ( as per usual ) . This time he 's at the vet with his new dog . Scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest ones in the show ( think Columbo 's discomfort over the nude model in " " Suitable for Framing " " ) . Columbo is hilarious when he 's dithering or bumbling deliberately in order to trip up his quarry ; but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he 's with non-suspects . Bochco , by contrast , shows Columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of low-key scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story . ( And I 'm grateful he didn 't strain for a punchline to Columbo 's quest to give the dog a name . As far as we learn , the dog remains nameless . ) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode , and Peter Falk makes the most of them . He 's particularly good in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill herself , much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist . And he 's even better in his scenes playing cat-and-mouse with Cassavetes . That these two long-time friends and collaborators would play off each other brilliantly is to be expected ; and that 's what we get . Notice how Alex Benedict can 't help but admire the deceptively dimwitted Columbo , even as the brilliant detective is tightening the noose around his neck.Bochco makes the most of every situation in his script . When Columbo goes to question Benedict 's snooty mechanic , of course 혯 of course ! 혯 he asks the man to look at his own beat-up heap . And when Benedict finds Columbo at the Hollywood Bowl before rehearsal , of course 혯 of course ! 혯 he 's on the piano playing " " Chopsticks . " " And what should our audacious lieutenant bring with him but the victim 's typewriter with the phony suicide note still in the roller.Columbo also has good scenes with a precocious little girl ( Dawn Frame ) and the lovely Blythe Danner , who plays Cassavetes 's wife . It 's nice to see Myrna Loy show up as Danner 's mother , though she does little with her minor role.The director Nicholas Colasanto ( who also acted , most notably as Coach in " " Cheers " " ) does a perfectly creditable job , though he follows the lead of nearly every other " " Columbo " " director by adding one or two silly flourishes . Scenes end by going out of focus and begin by coming into focus . Then there 's that bit where Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped at the scene of the crime 혯 and we see a zoom-in shot of it reflected in his sunglasses . There 's also one scene with Myrna Loy and group of old fogies that is atrociously performed by everyone except Cassavetes.These are quibbles , though . This is a splendidly entertaining episode , the kind that made me a " " Columbo " " fan . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad . My dad actually recorded it off the TV . I must have watched is over 20 times , before the relatively recent release on DVD.I of course bought and watched the DVD and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed . In the first version , which I still have on VHS , the mood of the film , thanks to the dialogue , was actually very dark . However the new version , featuring Van Der Beek et al , is more comic.To put it another way , it 's like watching the original US release of Akira with that dub , before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese.I 'm in no way complaining , the story and quality of animation are not detracted from , but it does raise the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film ..... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes , this cartoon is not for you . But if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation , come on in ! In this cartoon , Popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what looks like a Japanese fishing boat . The two Japanese fishermen trick Popeye into thinking that they want a peace treaty signed . But looks can be deceiving ; the fishing boat turns out to be a Japanese navy ship ! What follows is considered today to be morale-boosting propaganda.Be forewarned , the representations of the Japanese in the film are done in a mean-spirited fashion . Keep in mind , though , that there was a war going on at the time . But I strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the WWII era . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This groundbreaking film is truly a work of art . I went into the screening at the convention in Indiana with very low expectations , having already viewed 2 other film with " " gamer " " in the title ( both of which were so bad that by the end of the second one I had plucked out one of my own eyes with my drinking straw and a twisted paper clip I found between the seat cushions ) . But from the opening credits " " Dorkness " " had me . The temperate Northwest setting made a beautiful backdrop for the drama surrounding the frustrated game master , Lodge ( powerfully portrayed by Nathan Rice ) and his misfit band of friends who set aside the real-life dramas they face everyday to face fantastical dramas in the setting Lodge provides for them . After the first scene ( set in the fantasy world they inhabit ) They are violently thrust back into the world they so desperately try to escape . This drew so many comparisons to my own life that I was moved to tears . Rice 's acting is of such amazing caliber that I truly believed within the first 20 minutes of the film that he really was a twenty-something male suffering from frustration , male pattern baldness and an annoying group of " " friends " " that can 't seem to grasp concepts like right and wrong . Lodge 's friends are of some note here : Leo , the oldest and heaviest of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job , aside from lodge . Yet he seems to gravitate socially towards Gary , the youngest of the group . This seems only slightly odd at first until you realize that Gary is , in fact , a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects outside his " " fantasy " " world . This dichotomy serves , not to confuse , but to inform and uplift the audience about the importance of diversity in our society . My only complaint about this is that the actors who portray Leo ( Scott C. Brown ) and Gary ( christian Doyle ) seem to play the characters for laughs at times , as though they were informed they were acting in a comedy instead of a hard-hitting action / drama . Speaking of action , Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass , the third and most influential member of Lodge 's motley crew. the tension is always high when he is on screen , both when he is arguing passionately about his beliefs to Lodge or when displaying his fantastic Martial Arts skills as " " Silence " " his fantasy character . Or even when he turns around suddenly to face the audience and you reflexively duck in the audience so as not to get smacked by his fantastic chin . Lewis Lights up the screen no matter what he 's doing and I hope to see more of him in the future . Once the action begins in this movie , it just doesn 't quit. the drama and the action blend so seamlessly at times that you can 's tell whether your in the middle of a frenetic action sequence or a touching dramatic moment . Truly a thrill ride of Epic proportions , I would recommend " " The Gamers : Dorkness Rising " " as required viewing for anyone who loves film . It was almost worth losing an eye over . ~ Chip Deedlenick , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" James J. Corbett , heavyweight champion of the world from 1892 to 1897 , turned out to be Errol Flynn 's favorite role . Possibly because he didn 't have to wield a sword or be in a western . He grew tired of the swashbucklers and he said in his autobiography that he felt he was miscast in westerns and couldn 't understand why people liked him in them . It is an enjoyable film , but hardly does tell the real story of James J. Corbett.As portrayed Corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division , a man who used brains and speed more than brute strength to win . He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown . He was also a compulsive womanizer and in that was a lot like the man portraying him . Of course that was not shown on the screen . The character that Alexis Smith plays , the banker 's daughter who falls for him , has no basis in reality . Corbett was in fact married twice and was flagrantly unfaithful with both of his wives.Also though after he lost his title and after the events of this film are concluded he suffered a great personal tragedy . His father in a moment of depression , probably over finances because he lost heavily betting on his son to beat Bob Fitzsimmons , shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself . The murder / suicide hardly squares with the happy clan that Alan Hale presided over.One thing though that I did like about Gentleman Jim . Ward Bond got the career role of his life in playing John L. Sullivan . Director Raoul Walsh got a great performance out of Bond as the blustering , but lovable Sullivan . Even given some of Sullivan 's bad points that don 't make it to the screen like rabid racism , Bond 's portrayal is the quintessential John L. and the best thing about Gentleman Jim.Speaking of racism , one thing that should have been told was the fact that Sullivan while champion refused on grounds of race to meet Peter Jackson who was black and from Australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time . I say probably because as a challenger Corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds to a draw . That fight more than any other created a demand for a Sullivan-Corbett title match . Of course when Corbett was champion he refused to give Jackson a title shot . Maybe he didn 't want another 61 round marathon with someone who may have been better on that particular day.Gentleman Jim is not Jim Corbett 's story , it is a movie of Errol Flynn playing at being James J. Corbett . But Corbett had he been alive in 1942 no doubt would have loved the movie and loved Flynn 's portrayal of his life . It 's as he would have liked to have been remembered . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

OR YOU CAN , WHATEVER.They 're are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another ; Liars , Cheats , maybe even some words that can 't be uttered . But When Elm Street 6 : Freddy 's Dead shows everyone who thought the series got old , and wanted to stop seeing him , or people who wanted their hero ( or Villian ) just stops for his final breath , This film was it.This film starts with a parody of Wizard of Oz , Then you see a kid who is named only as John Doe , Who is the last child in Springwood , Ohio , leaves and gets out of Freddy territory . A woman who resides at a hospital / place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy , and at the same time , has a dream about a man , a water tower , and a promise of a secret floating in her mind , goes back to Springwood to figure out this frightening vision , and soon finds out that she is Freddy 's child , And we soon find out that Freddy can only leave Springwood if his daughter can be a sort of host for him . And beyond that , fright ensues . This film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know.This film has tons of humor , and cameo appearences , like Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold , Alice Cooper , Johnny Depp , and a very young Breckin Meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision of flowers and Iron Butterfly 's " " In-a-gadda-da-vida " , " then gets stuck in a super Mario parody of sorts .

" I go to the movies to be entertained . I was very entertained by the first film in this series : The DaVinci Code . It had plenty of twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested .

Angels and Demons is made pretty much with the exact same style as the previous film , but faster paced , which I liked . Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bit.What I really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious , they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable .

" Dirty Sanchez is the more extreme , British version of Jackass in which the four boys ( Pritchard , Dainton , Joycey and Pancho ) go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other . The reason this show is better than Jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny . There are 3 series of the show , the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives eg. there 's an episode on their love lives , jobs etc . The second series sends the boys to try out different occupations . The third follows their European tour . It seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series . In my opinion the third series is the best , but trust me when i say , if you have a week stomach DO NOT WATCH , as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I can 't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent . Who would they have chosen ? The shrill character actor , Charles Lane ?

" Katherine Heigl , Marley Shelton , Denise Richards , David Boreanaz . Even before I knew what this film was about , these names were enough to draw me in . Gorgeous , talented and popular , these are performers to look out for.Ok , where do I start . We already know what the film is about . Five beautiful girls being targeted by a ' romantic ' serial slasher , a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago . His trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards , maggot-infested chocolates and a bleeding nose . His weapon of choice : well , take a pick - axe , knife , electric powerdrill , bow and arrow , hot iron , etc . Ok , so basically it 's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality.Horror movies aren 't supposed to be Shakespeare , but I 'm not gonna go there . I love horror movies , but not all of them . This one , I adore . It 's up there with some of my other favorites . It 's funny , sexy and scary . The killer 's mask is childishly creepy , and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky . The acting is topnotch : Denise Richards , Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are a lot of fun . I really did wish to see much , much more of Katherine Heigl . I am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon . Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actress , and Jessica Cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in Urban Legend 2 . The smaller parts were also good ; Hedy Buress was a hoot ( ' bleedmedry.com ' ) and that younger version of Denise Richards looked frightfully like her.Highlights : Every death scene had a particular distinction to it . The creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue . The hottub scene , while ludicrous , was well done . And the audiovisual maze was sinister . The soundtrack is great , with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes.Lowpoint : I felt as though the killer wasn 't featured enough , we barely saw the mask , and it wasn 't featured at all during the climax . I also thought the climax was really unfocused , but fun nonetheless.The twist at the end wasn 't that big of a surprise , but I 'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole ' explaining killer ' routine.I don 't like to tell people which movies they should see , but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that I thought was really worth seeing , then Valentine would be it.My rating : 10 / 10 ( Bullseye ! ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs , American gun culture , divorce and marriage ; yet , it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each . Kathy Bates is " " Amazing " " Grace Beasley , and as a character actor of staggering range , she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos . With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max , her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England , the story is just intriguing enough to entertain . Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox , a closet gay singer murdered by a cross-bow killer in Chicago . His valet-lover Dirk Simpson , played by the stunning Rupert Everett , must overcome Victor 's siblings , including Lynn Redgrave , who want to turn their home into a tribute museum , and teams with Bates and her dwarf daughter-in-law , Maudy Beasley , to find the killer among the homeless of Chicago.The entire cast sing at various points in the pursuit , and are excellent , esp. the talented Price and Bates . This implausible storyline , both funny and bizarre , is one of the most off-center films .

" What an ambitious project Kenneth Branagh undertook here and how well it was realized ! This is the first filmed version of ' Hamlet ' to use the full text of Shakespeare 's play , but Branagh didn 't do it just because " " it was there . " " His intention , I believe , was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down , so to speak . In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves , a fair enough proposition and one that 's a bargain.The setting is a generic 19th century European one and this does more than work well , it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself . The production design and cinematography and both outstanding , which helps immensely when you 're watching a four-hour movie . Branagh 's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise . The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play . Since so much of ' Hamlet ' is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels , battles , etc . , this can be a daunting task . But everything Branagh tries to do seems to work.Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor / writer / directors , if not always the best , since he made his big splash with ' Henry V. ' One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times . In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again , but there is a method at work . Let 's face it , ' Hamlet ' is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before , he or she needs help even if they 've read the play . Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film , even if you don 't know the literal meaning of every arcane word . This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an Oscar nomination.There are so many other outstanding performances here they 're almost too numerous to mention , but some of them must be acknowledged . Derek Jacobi as Claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to Kate Winslet when it comes to handing out praise . Her portrayal of Ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling , made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time ! She looks to me like the finest young actress around . Other super performers in no particular order are Richard Briers , Nicholas Farrell , Michael Maloney , and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz , respectively . Honorable mention goes to Julie Christie , Charlton Heston , and Robin Williams , who manages to do his thing here successfully . Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works . The one cast member who doesn 't , inexplicably , is Jack Lemmon . In the very opening scene he appears , and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood , Lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor . You know this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh , since everything else about the movies screams out that it 's the work of a perfectionist.Not to be facetious when speaking of a four-hour movie , but it does seem just a tad too long . Some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit , if I may be so bold , and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome.Did I forget anything , other than Patrick Doyle 's score ? No doubt I did . I 'll just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of ' Hamlet , ' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort . " " Holes " " doesn 't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp . For the first time events are not explained in details . The flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer . I must admit that at first I was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie . But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story . Besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities . ( One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character , like learning to read won 't contribute to that ) .

" Frank Sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it 's hard to single one out as the best . If I had to name the best thing he ever did , though , it would be his performance as Frankie Machine , the heroin- addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved , just barely , by the love of a good woman ( played by an exceptionally babelicious Kim Novak ) . The " " cold-turkey " " scenes between Sinatra and Novak are terrifying and heartbreaking . The movie is very nearly perfect , in fact , from Saul Bass 's title graphics to the ground-breaking jazz score by Elmer Bernstein . It might not be the sort of thing anyone thinks of in regard to the 1950s , but it 's a must-see nevertheless . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an Austen novel . Although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular " " Pride and Prejudice , " " " " Emma " " is a lush and relatively faithful TV version of Austen 's novel -- especially considering its short length . The biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one , as the unnecessary snobbishness that Austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to Emma 's character in the rest of the book . I thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well-picked . Kate Beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in Gwyneth Paltrow 's ' 96 version . Samantha Morton 's wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the Harriet we know from the book . Mister Knightly 's role is carried out extremely well in my opinion ; both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much-neglected , sumptuous film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I can only be grateful when I see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters , good scripts and good acting .

" Once you sit down to see this film " " A Cannon for Cordoba " " you get the feeling it 's going to be a great . The reason ? The film begins with a rousing score by noted composer Elmer Bernstein who gave us such memorable themes as ' The Great Escape and the Magnificent Seven . ' Indeed , when you read the opening credits headlining the cast is none other than George Peppard as Capt. Rod Douglas , you know it 's going to have action and lot 's of it . Furthermore when you see actor John Russel playing General John J. Pershing , you know you 're in for a heroic saga . The story is taken from the annals of the Mexican revolution and involves the U.S. in a border town dispute with the Mexican bandits who cross the Rio Grande in the early 1900s . Among the most brazen of the rebel leaders is General Cordova ( Raf Vallone ) . With his army of Mexican revolutionaries , he attacks Pershing , kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces . Since the United States Army cannot enter Mexico legally , Capt. Douglas is sent on what is slated a suicide mission , without orders and without aid from Pershing . His mission is to retrieve the Cannons , destroy a rebel stronghold and bring Cordova back alive . Selecting the roughest , toughest , most experienced , certainly the most insolent men available , Douglas enters Mexico and attacks the nearly impregnable fortress . Dramatic action follows , as does lots of explosive excitement . If one is asks for criticism , I would say the choice of heavies . Vallone and John Larch are not very menacing . Not so with the men who side with Peppard . Pete Duel and Don Gordon ( Who is superb . ) Nevertheless , this movie is recommended as good viewing . * * * * , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Just watched this movie on DVD and thought the acting was very good , but the over all story left a lot to be desired . This movie has the same texture and look of Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy . Hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle ; on the underbelly of society , in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use , crime , violence , sex , and a total lack of self-respect for anyone or anything , including themselves.Val Kilmore is outstanding in his role of " " burnt-out " " former porn star John Holmes . The supporting cast is just as good . However , this is a bleak , dark , disturbing , and depressing film . The murder was brutal , but the daily lives of these people were brutal as well . Unless you have an interest in these murders or were a " " fan " " of John Holmes , this really isn 't a film to see . If you want to see a docu-drama on murder , Truman Capote 's 1960s In Cold Blood starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is much better . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The set design and lighting were out of this world , creating an atmosphere that you felt you were actually living in . V unusual for a comedy.Unfortunately I have only encountered one other person ( apart from the other reviewer here ) who ever knew that this programme existed . In fact I have to thank the IMDb for coming into existence and proving to me that I hadn 't in fact imagined the whole series in a drunken haze , which I was seriously starting to believe ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that I was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the UK . The style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it . All you have to do is read all the positive comments ( not a single negative that I can see ) to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination . I now understand from reading the comments it got CANCELLED that 's just so unbelievable . What a bunch of ' headless overpaid suited turkeys ' there must have been ( or just maybe still are ) running around to do that . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was an adorable movie . A real feel-good movie when you need one . The story is light ( this is no Gone With the Wind ) but sometimes , one needs this kind of plot . Funny and warm characters , fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / wardrobe.Parminder K. Nagra ( also from the TV show ER ) is WONDERFUL in this role . She is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood . All should keep an eye on her , she 's going to be BIG in the future.Also impressing was the soundtrack for this movie . A nice mix of modern and Indian tunes . I was dancing throughout most of the movie.Highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit . It was a pretty weak field for Best Picture that year . I think " " Apocalypse Now " " should have taken it , but the Academy probably felt it was too violent and strange , plus Vietnam was still too recent . Meryl Streep was tremendous , as always , playing a very unlikeable character . I don 't usually compliment directors , but I really liked that bit with the elevator doors .

" The Falcon and the Snowman is the true story of two college-age rich kids from L.A. who become spies for the Soviet Union . One , played by Penn , is already a drug smuggler up to his eyeballs in trouble . The other , played by Hutton , lands a position at an aerospace firm where his job is to man a top-secret cable facility . There he learns of some of the dirty tricks employed by the CIA on foreigners that America doesn 't like . Don 't forget that the movie is set the early 70s , the time of Vietnam and Watergate . Appalled at what he 's learned , the Hutton character decides to betray his country and convinces his buddy to join him . Neither of them is long on brains , it is not long before they 're way in over their heads with no way out.This is not a thriller , and is rather slowly paced . If this is not a problem for you , then it is well worth the rental . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This Hong Kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than week 's worth of ' The Young & The Restless ' . This one is more of a throwback to the original ' Emmanuelle ' trilogy ( especially ' Goodbye Emmanuelle ' ) than a D 'Amato sleazefest . Chai Lee ( Emy Wong ) undergoes a stunning transformation from dour nurse to hot-to-trot streetwalker . Future Italian porn star / politician , Illona Staller , who would later go by the name Ciccolina ( and have sex with an HIV positive John Holmes ) plays Emy 's competition . Exotic locales and some decent soft-core scenes round this one out . Recommended for fans of the original ' Emmanuelle ' , of which I am one ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The movie celebrates life.The world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has " " Happy End " , " just like in the closing scene of the movie.The movie has wonderful soundtrack , mixture of Serbian neofolk , Gypsy music and jazz.This movie is very refreshing piece of visual poetics.The watching experience is like you 've been sucked in another colorful , romantic and sometimes rough world.Like Mr. Kusturica movie should be . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What can I say about this movie except that it is great fun ! John Cusack plays Hoops McCann a recent High School graduate who has two choices , learn to take up the family business of street sweeping or spend the summer at Nantucket with his pal George Calamari ( played hilariously by Joel Murray ) and his zany friends.When I say zany , believe me , it can 't get much zanier than the Stork brothers , Egg ( Bobcat Goldthwait ) and Clay ( Tom Villard ) and Ack Ack Raymond ( Curtis Armstrong ) . Throw in a little girl named Squid and her weirdo mutt and a great performance by Demi Moore and you have the makings of a split your sides laughing , movie.The laughs flow freely in this movie and the story line , though the typical good versus bad and good conquers , is great with the twist of a regatta as the showdown.I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes loads of laughs and a feel good time .

" There is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school . The parental absence at all important junctures in Lauren Ambrose 's school search provide admissions interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading . The incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another ; thus masking her Mother 's truer involvement in family losses . The daughter , Lauren , really has done something big - trying to make her mother fulfilled and then that plan itself , somewhat heroic in light of the age she is - still giving when everyone around her taking , somersaults on her . A heart not yet connected to her head - something that age has never had a genuine answer to even to this day . Her replacement of a significant other , not necessarily requiring a father image , however , a trusted authority nonetheless being imagined if not real . A pure cup without a handler ....... ( see the movie ) . Everyone needs a friend to see through understanding of a proportional world - she made hers up on what she knew of life at the time . She has all the mental capacity for higher learning though having no friends present for her time makes the ending a developmental tragedy in progress ... given a bird in a cage ... not a puppy ... that would a least get her walking two times a day . Ideas out of the roof she is under would be the developing on her sidewalk life . Sad is the looming psychiatric ending ... how could she be committed at a time when she has proved an important responsibility ? ( believe it or not taking of a dog is a better witness than taking care of a bird at this time of her life ) The symbolic cage of her in a cage is too much mental and self fulfilling of some of her writings within the story . The neighbor college freshman is developed just fine , he is as developed as the training education will allow for the mental maturity that dwarfs her eternal purpose compared to his fateful conditioning . I myself , eventually just went to the Mensa magazine and got a $ 20.00 degree saying I was an ( Hon ) DDiv . It offered all the education that buying the truth would and independence to skip fecal content . " " Run the world " " or do not get your own home was the college offer . Who was freeing anyone for superior time for the learning ? The only sin is not having your pleasure right . What fight figged on that ? She has been denied an act for life commensurate to her love for life . What is college , a reward for failing high school ? Do you graduate with your class or without it - what is the exchange ? A lifetime of correcting youth with only questions ? Could lead occur w / o a question ? The loss followed as much for good as bad . When was she given a mind for sexual intimacy or growth for her good self to be fulfilled ? Why didn 't good people treat her with good things ? If good people do not do good things for good people , what is good for ? She is young , pretty and walked on long before personal development is given a winning game . Her act taken in life with a closed door . Perhaps the title would be better as " " Christmas Doors " " not " " Admissions " . " , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I couldn 't help but feel that this could have been a bigger movie than it was . The screenplay is highly intelligent and it just seemed that it could have been opened up in a way more reminiscent of Seven . Not by changing the story - I think mainly through the cinematography . The cinematography was the only thing that I found to be holding back the film . On the other hand , the pacing was absolutely on point . Whoever worked on the editing really did their job well . And I thought Bill Paxton did a great job of directing . Now away from the technical stuff ... This movie threw me for a loop . SPOILER AHEAD ! ! ! ! All along , I really felt that Bill Paxton was crazy and then when Adam finally took the FBI agent to the Rose Garden to show him where the bodies were buried and revealed who he was , I got thrown for a loop . I had suspected the first part of the twist but what really threw me was when he touches the agent and sees the agent murder his mother and the fact that the agent too ( without any words spoken , simply by touch ) sees it again with Adam and asks him how he knew . My dilemma was not that it was yet another twist thrown in but the almost ungraspable idea that this man and his father were not crazy but actually picked out ' bad guys ' so to speak , knowing their sins and crimes already . I don 't endorse an eye for an eye so I didn 't leave the film being able to believe that they were doing God 's work . Instead I chose to believe that they were both clairvoyant and that the father had gone off the deep end one day from it and through the things that he subjected his sons to , disturbed them permanently also . That was my interpretation but the vexing thing about the film was it 's like a house of cards and a never-ending circle and what is the correct interpretation of the disturbing events you 've sat through . It 's definitely one of those movies where I 'd love to be able to meet the writer so I could just ask him what the real meaning was to it all . Were they crazy and psychotic ? Were they simply telepathic and took license because of it ? Or did they have some sort of appearance from God ? And if so , was it God or the Devil disguising himself as God . My friends and I found ourselves talking about it all night trying to figure out what was what and what the filmmakers had thought was the answer when they made this movie.A definitely perplexing and thought invoking film with some very disturbing but certainly not sensationalistic elements to it . It 's not a perfect film , but it definitely is it 's own thing . Great directorial work and acting by Bill Paxton and the child that played Fenton was extremely good . I hope he doesn 't end up relegated to the child actor syndrome as he seems to have a lot of promise . I gave this movie a good vote for the majority of the components that make a film , but I would have voted higher if wasn 't for the feeling that something ( although I can 't pinpoint what ) was off and if it hadn 't have been , the movie would have gone to an even higher level . Still , a definite recommend , especially for those that are inquisitive . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets ; a slimy South American drug-lord and a prominent general.Moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere , Sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller , taking it 's time , establishing it 's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences . Director Llosa isn 't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat ; some detours here don 't add up to much . But this film is far better than his Stallone / Stone travesty The Specialist.Billy Zane , usually incredibly tiresome , does surprisingly well as the inexperienced Sniper teamed up with veteran Berenger . As for Berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget Hollywood venture . He can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he 's very convincing here , reprising the role twice more in direct to DVD sequels . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This sweeping drama has it all : top notch acting , incredible photography , good story . It is often compared to " " Braveheart " " because both movies take place in historical Scotland . Even though I love Braveheart , I think this is the better of the two films . Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance ( should have been nominated for an Oscar ) . Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role . Tim Roth plays one of the most evil , despicable , characters in film history ( he was nominated for an Oscar ) . John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose , another dislikeable character . I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play . This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan , and Lord Montrose . Rob Roy is a self made man , who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor . Montrose , who , inherited his title , has no sense of honor . And that is basically what this story is all about ; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility . This movie is very entertaining , it should appeal to all . It has romance , action , beautiful scenery , and has a exciting plot . One of my favorite films . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the one hand , I 'm happy . I 'm watching something that has been well thought out , seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting . On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced . TV and films are so consistently packed with easy , condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity . Then you see someone like Davis , who , without the " " benefit " " of studio notes or substantial budget ; can create a really cool little comic gem . Producers and network suits need to turn to the Travis Davis ' out there for material and stop awarding deals to people simply because their resume or agent may demand they should . Boy-Next-Door has , hopefully , gained the attention of the right people to facilitate more work from Davis . It 's really fun and very well done ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I have loved this movie all of my life . It 's such an intelligent story also , with plenty of classical allusions. eg . The ship that went missing decades earlier was called the Bellerophon . Well , in classical mythology this was the man who slew the Chimera , a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures . In FP , Walter Pidgeon is clearly the chimera- himself and his Id monster . I like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a modicum of intelligence , unlike most modern blockbusters which spend $ 150m on special effects , but about $ 1.50 on a screenplay.Cheers , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I 've really enjoyed this adaptation of " " Emma " . " I have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again.Though it only lasts 107 minutes , most of the novel plot and sub-plots were developed in a satisfactory way . All the characters are well-portrayed . Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in Emma Thompson 's Sense and Sensibility.As a foreigner , I particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors . The setting and costumes were beautiful . I find this version quite on a par with the 1995 miniseries " " Pride and Prejudice " " but then the producer and screenwriter were the same . Kate Beckinsale did a really good job portraying " " Emma " " of whom Jane Austen said she would create a heroin no-one but her would love . She is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable . Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Mr Knightley , not an easy part , I think , though he has not the charisma shown by Colin Firth 's Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice . Even the end scene ( the harvest festival ) which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows Emma being cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him , even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity , had she been in his situation . A strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film . I find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from Jane Austen 's novels . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" After seeing Meredith in " " Beyond the Prairie " " I had to buy another film with her staring . I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick . It 's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen . Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on " " Beyond the Prairie " . " It 's worth it at any price , this one needs to pay you to see . This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman . Perhaps some of her latest might fit but I haven 't seen them .

" " " THINGS TO COME " " Movie Review by kWRiceHere is another wonder filled science fiction film from a different time and place . It is a film I 've only seen in truncated parts , but Art should be taken as a whole . I experienced this film as it was designed , in a darkened theatre , on a silver screen , with whirling reels of film and an audience to share it with . That audience and myself were effected by this film ! One woman who lived through WW II was choked up by the remembered ravages of war and replenished by the positive , albeit corny , ending.The things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits . The first thing we see is " " H.G. Wells " " in bold angular block copy much like the " " Superman " " of yore . It is not the film title , but the creator 's title , and then before any other humans , such as actors or production , are listed , the director William Cameron Menzies is up there ! Who ? You 've probably seen his work before , " " Around the World in 80 Days , " " " " Pride of the Yankees , " " and " " Gone With the Wind . " " He did not direct after this Sci-Fi epic opera he and Mr. Wells created , but his film imagery , sets , and design are very recognizable.That imagery is very effecting . I recognized images from many other films , that have paid homage to this classic . The recent " " Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy " " is obvious , along with Bugs Bunny , " " Fantasia , " " " " Monty Python and the Holy Grail , " " " " Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow , " " " " Night of the Living Dead " " and more that I know of , but which titles escape me . This is real special effects here , scenes now done with CGI are done with actors , big sets , and detailed models . This film was made in 1936 , and it 's obvious it meant something to the other auteurs . Wells and Menzies also worked with Bliss , doing the music , and Korda , the producer , to create a masterpiece with message , warning , and sermon.The lines the Shakespearean actors Cedric Hardwicke , Ralph Richardson and Raymond Massey speak , sometimes sound preachy , but I also heard lines I still hear now . " " These toys children have nowadays are nothing like I had when I was child , " " " " It 'll help develop their coordination , " " " " What do we need books for , what do we need to read for ? " , " " " We don 't need cars , there 's nowhere to go , we have all we need right here , " " " " There will be no war . " " But war there is ! The naive citizens of " " Everytown " " refuse to see the literal writing on the wall . The never-ending war explodes Christmas eve . The little boy wanting to be a good soldier like his daddy is an image that will likely always stay with me . This is the world of 1936 that wore blinders to Hitler 's appeasement . This war does not end . The poison gas of the aerial wars segues into the second act.It is another dark age . No government , no services , and people carried along and cheering the war that no one remembers anything about . Plague , warlords and bullying to get the planes flying for fuel that no longer exists . Loved ones are shot in the street , before they can carry the plague to another . Midway there is a marvelous vignette about the Rolls Royce , that is a much needed respite mid-way . Into this lands a futuristic plane that heralds the future.That future is the third act . The world has rebuilt itself with the help of that " " puny animal , man . " " Helicopters fly in this film , before they were even invented . The Plumber 's Helper has other uses than the Dalek 's or Glenn Miller 's . Wide screen plasma screens beguiling the masses , and orators inciting the people to tear it all down . " " Beware the concussion , you have been warned ! " , " the city father warns the riotous populace . So be warned , this film might hit you like it hit me . There are some cute miscues and miscalculations , but the thought provoking idealism is what is really worth pondering again , and I do want to see this artful film again . Others criticize Mr. Wells vision . It is very easy to work with 20 / 20 hindsight regarding things , costumes and foley miscues . I believe Mr. Wells ' " " Things to Come " " is not about things , but is actually about concepts , social trends , and philosophical ideals . Besides , we are now just beginning the new millennium and are not in the time still to come . This is not cheap cardboard British Science Fiction , but worthwhile Epic Filmed Opera , sans singing , that as a whole concept overcomes some minor dated shortcomings . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The first in a new style of films for Lamas- no tattoo 's , motorcycles or karate . I , for one , miss them . But this is a serious movie . He plays a FBI profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone , including himself . Gary Busey is either a great actor or somebody I wouldn 't want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street . Kristen Cloke pursues Lamas as doggedly as she pursues the serial killer . There is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not the least of which is the ending . It seems to never come - there is always one more layer to the story . Cloke and Lamas start out as the good guys , turn into the bad guys and somehow end up the heroes . But it 's definitely worth the rental price . For maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar , a bag of popcorn and a soft drink . You 're going to the MOVIES ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Christopher Nolan 's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out . Shot on a micro budget of $ 6,000 this is a student film with real class . The film is shot in black and white , and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan 's appearing in the movie . This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good . You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven 't since this was made 6 years ago.Nolan 's thriller , much like Memento , does not play chronologically , it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction . The writing is fantastic . It is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting . I thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent.For a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all , this is so good . It is superior to most that Hollywood studios offer and Nolan after three films ( this , the superior Memento and the not quite as good but still excellent Insomnia ) has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times . I can 't wait for Batman.This film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch . It is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising . I also thought that the score from David Julyan was also excellent , very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it . He has gone on to compose Nolan 's other films . Overall I would recommend this , I intend to get all of Nolan 's films . This is a low budget gem . * * * * * , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For every fan of coming of age tales , this 3 hour adaptation of theSarah Waters novel is pure fun . Cinematic nods to Baz Luhrman 'skinetic style , as well as to all those prim and proper period piecesever present on the BBC ( where you 're likely to have seen almostevery prominent member of this cast ) . It 's rather bawdy and overthe top in spots , but that 's just what the novel called for . The castis appealing and , in the cases of Anna Chancellor and HughBonneville , perfect . In the case of Rachel Sterling , as our heroineNan , you simply must overlook the fact that she 's far too pretty toever be mistaken for a boy and run with it . It 's a fantasy , after all .

" Gundam Wing is a fun show . I appreciate it for getting me into Gundam and anime in general . However , after watching its predecessors , such as Mobile Suit Gundam , Zeta Gundam , and even G Gundam , I find Wing to be Gundam Lite.Characters : An aspect long held by Gundam is to have their characters thrust into difficulties and grow into maturity . This does not happen in Wing . Heero is top dog at the beginning , and he 's top dog at the end . Personalities do not change , growth is never achieved . The best character is Zechs , who is for all intents and purposes a hero throughout most of the series . But suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason.Mecha : Wing has great suit designs . The Gundams are super cool , with the Epyon being my favorite . I even consider a few of the OZ suit designs to be on par with some of the classic Zeon suits . But sweet suit designs doesn 't quite save the series from boring characters.Conclusion : In the end , Wing has cool fight scenes , though riddled with recycled animation , but shallow plot and character development . Enjoyable , but not moving like previous Gundam outings . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ice the Limerick : A virus pulled out of the iceJust didn 't know how to play nice.If infected you 'll killBecause you are ill.The cure is to be infected twice.Ice is a great episode ; one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldn 't ask for much better throughout the entire series . It starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also . A group of scientists in Alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other . Now Mulder and Scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened . As Mulder says this is either because they are brilliant or expendable . I take this to mean that they had better be brilliant or else ... The group soon finds out that the cause of mayhem is a small parasite pulled out of the ice core . A little worm that gets into the bloodstream and causes violent behavior . Since the pilot is infected the rest of the show turns to a suspenseful sort of who-done-it paranoiac thriller as the others begin to suspect each other of being infected . This is not helped at all by an overly paranoid doctor Hodge who is un-trusting of anyone which we learn early on by the first thing he asks : to see everyone 's credentials to " " make sure we are who we say we are " . " Events lead to finding out the one who is infected and learning how to cure them.There are a number of things I like about the episode and of course certain characters that I want to smack in the face from this episode , as well as a couple loopholes but most can be attributed to heightened caution and not thinking clearly . I like Bear from the moment I first meet him . Its a shame he has to die . I also like the scene shown from the other scientist 's point of view as Mulder and Scully argue in the other room . It gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a viewer and for me seems to say maybe we shouldn 't assume that just because someone is government means they know all sorts of conspiracy secrets . As much as Hodges frustrates me in this episode I do think that Mulder was as much to blame for some of the rash actions taken as any . I really like Scully in this episode . First of all she can tackle like a frickin linebacker ! Second I really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them out there and how she tries not to let trust and friendship of Mulder keep her from biasing her judgment . I love the scene when she goes into the room to sleep and first looks as the picture of the previous group all hugging and the birthday presents from them to whoever used to sleep in that room and then how she suddenly freaks out and pushes the dresser in front of the door and in a final touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor with her knees pulled into her chest we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that says " " Bosom Buddies " . " This is such great writing . A way to say without any words that Scully is worried that she may not be able to trust even her very best friend.Unfortunately this heightened suspicion leads the group to believe Mulder to be infected since he discover 's Murphy 's dead body even though they haven 't inspected him at all to find out for sure . That was my main problem with the behavior of the characters is they could easily have solved all the suspicion simply by giving blood . But I guess I probably would have acted rashly in that situation too . But then stupid Hodges decides that he has to assume Mulder is infected even though Mulder willingly surrenders and then is going willingly to be inspected and almost infects Mulder in the process . Luckily he sees that it is really Dasilva that is infected and we finally reach a resolution . At least as much as you can expect from an X-File . The " " government " " wastes no time in torching the evidence as always happens in these cases and Mulder is left with yet another frustrating " " unsolved " " case . In closing I give " " Ice " " and easy 10 / 10 and I leave you with a haiku . " " We 're not who we are . It goes no further than this . It ends right here right now .

" K-Pax is a very intriguing film . Is Prot ( Kevin Spacey ) really an alien , or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien ? That is the question that Dr. Powell ( Jeff Bridges ) must answer before the self proclaimed deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth.As the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered , both theories grow in credibility . His ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possibly possess . Yet the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life , filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality aberration . The ending seems to give the answer , but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know . Normally , I don 't like lady or tiger endings , but this one is tantalizing . I have my own theory that fits all the clues , but I don 't know that my theory is any more correct than anyone else 's.Director Iain Softley ( ' Wings of the Dove ' ) spins the tale delicately , with great skill . This is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate . This is not to say that the directing is technically inferior , because it is excellent . However , Softley remains unobtrusive , delivering great power through the use of subtlety , a pleasant change from today 's vanguard directors who visually grab and shake the viewer as if to scream , ' Look how brilliant I am ! ' Kevin Spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as Prot . This is a part that is extraordinarily demanding , requiring Spacey to render the cool and logical Prot one minute , and then switch gears to conjure his tormented alter ego under hypnosis the next . Spacey is so believable as both alien and human , it makes the viewer 's task that much more difficult . Jeff Bridges is also terrific as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot.This is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer . I rated it a 9 / 10 . If you must have closure at the end of a film , this movie will be very frustrating . However , if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits , you won 't be disappointed . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * minor spoilers * You know , it 's getting to the point where Walt Disney Television Animation might just as well be called Walt Disney Sequel Animation . These sequels range from excellent ( " " Beauty and the Beast : The Enchanted Christmas " " and the fantastic " " Lion King II : Simba 's Pride " " ) to horrible ( " " The Return of Jafar " " ) . ( This is , of course , my personal opinion . ) Now Disney brings us their latest sequel . " " Scamp 's adventure , " " and while it is flawed , it is still entertaining.The quality of animation is not up to par with Disney Feature Animation ; still , the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life . Lady and Tramp have not aged a day since 1955 . Trusty still talks about his sense of smell and " " Ol ' Reliable , " " and Jock still gives him grief about it . There 's a nice fight between Tramp and a huge dog in the dog pound , and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads ( though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor . ) I really don 't care for most of the songs ( though Roger Bart and Susan Egan--the singing voices of Scamp and Angel--sing their parts very nicely ) . Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done much better work in the past . Danny Troob 's score is okay , but nothing memorable . And some of the junkyard gang seem like excess baggage ; that is , they really don 't do much.The voice work , on the other hand , is quite good . While I don 't like Jeff Bennett as the dogcatcher , he is very good as Tramp . Chazz Palminteri does a nice job as Buster , leader of the junkyard gang , and Alyssa Milano gives what may be her best performance as Angel . Then there is Scamp ( who is the spitting image of his dad ) . He is voiced to PERFECTION by Scott Wolf . Wolf does a superb job of showing Scamp 's wild streak and his soft side.All in all , while " " Scamp 's Adventure " " is flawed , it still makes for rather entertaining viewing . It is my hope , however , that Walt Disney Television Animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have been a Hindi movie buff since the age of 4 but never in my life have a watched such a moving and impacting movie , especially as a Hindi film . In the past several years , I had stopped watching contemporary Hindi movies and reverted to watching the classics ( Teesri Kasam , Mere Huzoor , Madhumati , Mother India , Sholay , etc . ) But this movie changed everything . It is one of the best movies I have ever seen . I found it not only to be moving but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first generation Indian woman growing up in America . It helped me to understand my own family history , which was always something very abstract to me . But , to " " see " " it , feel it and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that Indian people endured . The film helped to put many things into perspective for me , especially considering the current world events . I never thought that a movie could change the way I think like this before ... it did . The plot is fantastic , the acting superb and the direction is flawless . Two thumbs up ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise . It is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie . It focuses mainly on emotions and it 's a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow.That 's because Sasha , like each superhero , takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn 't appreciate it . Sasha becomes an outlaw . While on the run , he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him.As you can see , the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics . It reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by Ram Gopal Varma . Everything happens very slowly . However , when there 's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what 's going on , it 's all over . But the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action . What is more important here is the outcome of Sasha 's actions , which are mostly very drastic . The score is very scarce , which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film . So basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it.Is the film worth it ? That is a question really difficult to answer . I don 't think that this experience enriched me so very much , but somehow I keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again . Mostly due to the atmosphere , which is really dense , but not suffocating because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope . After all they 're young people , who have all their lives to live . So no matter how hard it gets there 's always a slight joyous tune when they are together . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw this miniseries . I had read and watched many classics before , and I believed that most classics were boring , over-worded , and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best . This Jane Eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptions.Zelah Clarke is a fabulous actress , and she gives a wonderful portrayal of Jane Eyre . Her accent is delightful and her quiet , yet firm nature matches the young governess ' character exactly . Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester . His passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the brooding master of Thornfield Hall . I couldn 't sleep at all the night after I had watched this miniseries . The plot is both haunting and inspiring . The characters are masterfully performed , and the story is incredible . This is the best version of Jane Eyre to ever appear on film.I read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed Charolette Bronte 's writing . Jane Eyre is now my favorite film and book . If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life , watch the 1983 BBC version of Jane Eyre . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " The Journey " " is a very good film . Produced in the spring of 1958 , in Vienna , and released in 1959 , this movie was quite popular in his early years . Despite the political problems , which influenced the movie 's success ( because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution , the Cold War ) , " " The Journey " " is a very good film , but not well-known . I think it should be released immediately on DVD , because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home . One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner , their intense relationship . All their scenes together are very important , but they also reveal the strong feelings , the great passion and love between the characters ( Major Surov and Diana Ashmore ) . Another quality is the script , which is very well written . It was even published as a novel , by the screen player George Tabori . The film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end . At first , we didn 't know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary , because the Communist Major discovers that Diana 's friend , Paul Kedes , is Hungarian and he isn 't allowed to leave the country . The Major falls deeply in love with Diana and this is , in fact , the true reason why he doesn 't want to let her go . But after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen , and she kisses him , too , he lets her go . And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed-the Major and Diana say " " Goodbye ! " , " she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers , including Paul , while Surov is shot several times by some Hungarians , so he dies . Yul Brynner is very , very handsome and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful , charming , refined , just like an English Lady . Yul and Deborah are perfect together . They are one of the greatest couples of the Golden Hollywood . A true moviegoer should watch this film . " " The Journey " " has everything that a good film should have-a great , captivating story , interesting characters , a wonderful direction ( Anatole Litvak is , in my opinion , at his best ) . Finally , I want to give a message to Warner Bros. Studios or those who restore and release classic films : Please , release " " The Journey " " on DVD as soon as possible . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is , without question , one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet , like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp , are rare and haven 't even experienced by most people . That alone should be enough reason to buy this series , especially if you 're the curious type who ' wants to know ' .Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary , however . It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode . How many ways can different sea creatures swim , kill , poo , mate , and lay eggs , and do all of these ways really need to be explored ? But if you have a deep interest in sea life , this repetition shouldn 't become a problem for you at all . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend . The place was pretty packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss lines . I knew it looked like it would be good but it was much funnier than I thought it would be . I liked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci , they seemed really weird just like normal people , if that makes sense . I get sick of movies that show teenagers as being like cookie cutter people , like " " jock " " or " " geek " " or " " cheerleader " ... " etc . Both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to relate to . I will be recommending this movie to all my friends and waiting very eagerly for it to be out on DVD , Go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life ! I plan to see it again in the theater and I don 't go see things more than once very often . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" THE CHOKE ( aka AXE in the UK ) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight-to-DVD movie . I say " " supposedly " " because the title of the movie does not have the " " V " " in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie ( even though it does have the appearance of one ) .The plot is simple 혯 a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one.I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece , but this does not excuse the faults here . Even straight-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE ( which has a very low IMDb rating ) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called " " so bad , they 're good " " movies . However , THE CHOKE falls far short of being either a serious slasher ( such as HALLOWEEN ) or being a " " so bad it 's good " " movie ( such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE ) .The movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill . The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget . But , from there onwards , it 's downhill all the way.There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them . But , a few obvious ones stand out and I 'll go into them.The aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around 50 people present but after the music stops , there seems to be only around 8 people left ( and yet they 're all meant to be locked in ! ) .The characters in this movie are not likable at all . Most of the band members are aggressive foul-mouthed morons or just downright weird . No one really cares about what happens to them , and even their supposed friends forget about them when they 've been dispatched . The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church ( seriously ! ) . He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason . But sadly , even his presence can 't save the movie.There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation . Around 65 minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking . Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation . As in other straight-to-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND , the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all . There are plenty of over-the-top outbursts ( mainly from the male characters ) and one nearly results in a full-blown fight . In fact , the format could be said to go as follows : characters walk around--murder takes place--characters walk around--murder takes place . You get the idea.The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f-word being used . Perhaps this was meant to be funny , but it just comes off as sad . And more to the point , we have all seen this done a thousand times before ( usually to much greater effect ) .The movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all . The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger . A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons . They make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves . And much of the time , they don 't even pretend to be scared.In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE , the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed ( with the exception of the final murder when the killer 's identity is revealed ) . A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question . There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time . In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE , this served to make the film funny ( unintentionally of course ) , but here it is not funny at all.And , as another reviewer has pointed out , the soundtrack includes music that is very bad , even for those who like punk rock . The extras look uncomfortable dancing to it . The score ( at the end , there is no music at the beginning ! ) consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie.Don 't misunderstand the points made in this review . This reviewer likes bad movies ( such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE ) as much as the classics ( such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH ) . But , it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either . And even as straight-to-DVD movies go , this is a poor effort.On a positive note , the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes . But , when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously , these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion.Fans of the traditional 1980s B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie . And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything in their power to avoid it ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There 's not much anyone can say about this flick .... the plot is quite simple : Two police officers ( who also happen to be lovers ) are using a brothel as a stakeout in order to catch a criminal , with the help of the " " lady of the house " , " played by hardcore pornstar Chloe . As anyone can guess , there 's a few plot twists and some blurred alliances , but the writing was just horrible , even for a softcore movie.I 've read some previous posts about Nicole Hilbig 's accent ( she plays the female cop ) . Yes , it 's hard to understand what she 's saying at times , but I think I 've placed it . I did some sniffing around .... I think she 's from Germany , hence her odd-sounding accent . She makes an impression even without speaking , however ... she 's got a great looking body.There were a couple of " " from behind " " sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a softcore film .... excellent work there . The three-way scene toward the end wasn 't bad either . * SPOILER ALERT * I kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a part-time call girl at the end . She enjoyed her three-way WAY too much . * END SPOILER * I 'm not gonna nitpick about the story TOO much , seeing as this is a low-budget , direct-to-video softcore flick . However , it just seems like I 've seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storyline.Women : B ( Chloe and Hilbig were okay as the eye-candy ) Sex : B + ( scenes were kinda short , but good ) Story : C ( a recycled plot , but whatever works , eh ? ) Overall : B- , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In one of the more under-seen films of the late 1980 's , at a time when Oliver Stone was riding high with Platoon and Wall Street ( and before his opus Born on the Fourth of July ) , he co-scripted and directed this look at the world of radio , specifically one radio host in the middle of Texas . This man is Barry Champlain , in a once-in-a-career turn from Eric Bogosian , who wrote the original play and also co-wrote the script . Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those pundits you hear on the radio stations many of us might turn off . He 's got ideas on his mind , opinions , and he 's not only un-afraid to speak them , but also to stand up against the phone callers . The callers , indeed , are the driving force in the film , as Barry has to combat against the mindless , the obscene , the racist , and the purely absent-minded . As this goes on , he also has to contend with his boss ( Alec Baldwin ) and a hit or miss deal to go nationwide , outside the confines of the Southern way station he 's in.While after seeing the film I felt curious as to see how it would 've been done on stage ( I 'd imagine it was a one-man show , as Bogosian has had several on the side ) , the direction of the film is phenomenal . Stone has been known , almost typecast , as a director who loves quick cuts , the limitless effects of montage , and effects with the styles of camera-work and other little tricks , that give his films in the 90 's a distinctive , almost auteur look . But in the 80 's he had this energy and feverish quality to the look of the film , and wasn 't as frenzied as the other films . In order to add the proper intensity that is within the studio and head-space of Barry Champlain , he and DP Robert Richardson make the space seem claustrophobic at times , gritty , un-sure , and definitely on edge . The scenes in the middle of the film , when Barry isn 't in the studio , are fairly standard , but the style along with the substance in the radio scenes is among the best I 've seen from the Stone / Richardson combination.And one cannot miscalculate the performance of Bogosian , who can be obnoxious , offensive , angered , passive , and everything that we love and hate in radio show hosts . There is also a funny , near distracting supporting role for Michael Wincott as Kent / Michael / Joe , who prank calls him one night , and the next gets invited to the studio . These scenes are a little uncomfortable for a viewer , but it does get very much into the subculture head-space of the 80 's that Barry is as intrigued as he is critical of . The stoner may not ' get it ' , but as he says to him " " it 's your show " . " Indeed , it 's hard to cover everything that goes on within the talk , and there is a lot of it . But it 's never boring , and like Champlain himself , it 's not easy to ignore . And when Bogosian goes into his climactic tirade on air , with the background panning around in a continuous 360 spin , it becomes intoxicating , and a reason why freedom of speech is so powerful.Stone has been synonymous as a filmmaker of hot-button issues , who takes on subjects that were or still are controversial , and gives them a life-force that isn 't always great , but is all his own . Here his skills and ambitions don 't get in the way of Bogosian 's- it 's boosted , if anything , making an extremely skilled vision of what is essentially a near one-man show , which in and of itself is already well-written . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" With Harry Callahan getting up in years , the inevitable ' old man with a chip on his shoulder ' story had to come into play eventually .

" Wow . A truly fantastic ' trip ' movie that has tons of super-surreal imagery , dark intent and a black , pretty strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world . It 's populated with a very cute off-world bunch of characters that bend and flow with warped backgrounds.As with all cool fantasy , the wandering plot is secondary to the eye-popping visuals and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death , deluge , water elephants , samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish . I 'd never heard of it , but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil-work of American cartoonist ; Bill Plympton . It 's a demented delight for fans of odd , pretty things and it had me glued to the screen for fear I 'd miss something amazing .

" The Texas Revolution of 1835 to 1836 , including the periods preceding and immediately following , is depicted in this mediocre 3-hour made-for-television film , whose only redeeming value is bringing light and paying homage to Stephen F. Austin , the so-called " " Father of Texas " " whose life story had long been overshadowed by that of the legendary Sam Houston . The rest of the film is simply the usual " " Santa Anna is a tyrant " " storyline and with a weak attempt to show the Mexican perspective with a fictional Hispanic character displaying stereotypical Latin machismo . Combined with short low-budget battle scenes , such as the Alamao and San Jacinto , this film is recommended only for real history buffs who who do not come from Mexico . To its credit , the Mexican uniforms look accurate and the romantic subplot ( another love triangle ) doesn 't take up too much screen time . Overall , this movie depicts the violent secession movement by Texas ' Anglo-Saxon racial minority to be a positive and just revolution against Mexican tyranny as personified by the general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna , the so-called " " Napoleon of the West " .

" Others ' main criticism of this film--namely that Macy suddenly looks Jewish upon donning his glasses--is misplaced . The glasses are just the little bit of change needed to CONVINCE others he 's a Jew . The scene in which he says to his boss , ( paraphrasing ) " " but you KNOW what my background is , " " along with another discussion with his mother , suggests that he 's had to fight this same assumption in the past . The glasses now make him look just Jewish enough to " " confirm " " his neighbors ' and co-workers ' existing suspicions . Then there is his new wife 's large nose and taste for loud clothes , which OF COURSE means she 's Jewish . The whole point of the film is how those little stereotypical nothings become the entire basis for judging others . If he has a lisp , he must be gay . If he has long hair , he smokes dope . If he 's Hispanic , he 's got a knife ... and if he has round black glasses and he 's slight of build , he must be Jewish . Those statements all sound equally ( im ) plausible to me .

" It is hard to judge ' Imaginary Heroes ' without referring to the fact that director and script writer Dan Harris is only 25 . You can hardly believe seeing this film , which is not only a mature piece of work , professional and deep , but also with some of the defects of routine specific to older directors.The setting is the American suburb , too familiar from ' American Beauty ' or ' Desperate Housewives ' . As in ' American Beauty 'the film turns around a suicide , but here it happens at the beginning of the movie , and we are left watching a mid-class family coping with the death of the gifted sportsman brother and son . Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother , Sigourney Weaver is the mother , both are excellent trying to cope with the loss , to find the reason and motivation to survive . Harris drives his actors with a sure hand , and the first two sections of the film ( there are four in total , as the seasons of the year ) build a wonderful tension , with credible dilemmas and real questions . It is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly , it looks too tired and conventional , and I suspect that the producers may have interfered in the work of the young script-writer and director , trying to bring him closer to the Hollywood convention . That 's how this film fails to be a somber version of ' American Beauty ' , with a different focus . I am sure however that we will hear a lot about Dan Harris in the coming years . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I did something a little daring tonight when I watched this movie . I attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores . Sure , when this film originally was distributed , a piano score was probably played with it . Oftentimes , the director would choose the score himself ( Charlie Chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films ) . But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released . And , then again , there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score . I do not know the history of Potemkin 's score , so I decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within - film . Soon after I turned the music off , unaided ( or should I say unimpeded ) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen , I became utterly attached to the film . Visually , it is easily one of the most stunning of all films . Eisenstein was a master of composition . The editing , possibly the cinematic technique Eisenstein is most famous for ( montage ) , is extraordinary . The mood of this film is anger , and it stirred my passions violently . It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film , especially a drama , but films like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it . Come on ! You owe it to yourself to watch this film ! Your education is incomplete without it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The greatest movie ever.How 's that for a contention ? However , if we look at it through purely cinematic terms , it is clear that Three Colours Red is a masterpiece . It is not enough to merely say this - Three Colours Red is the masterpiece of world cinema . If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough , if you accept that Star Wars is not actually very good , if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time . As a discussion into human morality , Three Colours Red works on an intensely metaphysical level , with a depth that none can match . Blue went almost as far into the human psyche , but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat . White forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this , in retrospect , was better still , but still not quite there . Red , however , is the real thing . What he expresses in this movie , is an expression of what it is to be human . In fact , what he expresses is _ how _ it is to feel human . It forces us to examine up to the minutest detail , the very nature of our souls , of our ethical selves . In Red , one may find meaning on one of its several levels . On the first level , Red achieves a high level of verisimilitude - we could have no trouble in calling Red an exceptionally entertaining story . However , the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie . It is as if Kieslowski is saying : " " Ceci n 'est pas la r챕alit챕 " . " In effect , in pursuing a humanistic goal , Kieslowski can also challenge reality . It is a trick that Kieslowski has been attempting since Le Double Vie de V챕ronique , but not until this , his final film , did he finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate , philosophy and circumstance . The actors and actresses , too , appear to be at the mercy of a greater power . Valentine ( Ir챔ne Jacob ) , is aptly name , for she seems to represent an almost pure love . Meanwhile , the idea of first impressions is challenged by Jean-Louis Tritignant 's Judge Kern , a cantankerous man , who , by the end , becomes an almost all-knowing observer of events - a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together - a power to make people happy , a power which he could only achieve through Valentine.We have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures . In fact , films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature . It won 't happen , of course , but at least we have the power to view this film , knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can 't define , but all possess .

" A great film ! Slow : YES .... but original , deeply atmospheric , dark and horrifying , perfectly SURREAL ( feels like a nightmare ) .I 'd compare it to David Lynch ( Eraserhead , Inland Empire , Blue Velvet ) style maybe with mixed with a little bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch ( Insects ! ) . Also a bit of Jodorowsky ( Fando y Lis ) .... Add some Night on Earth , Angel Heart and a bit of Begotten , Pi , ( would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo ? ) Jacob 's Ladder , Barker 's The Forbidden and Salome - that should form together at least the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE.If you 're out for avantegardistic and / or surrealistic cinema ( like I am ) you 're gonna like this one . If you 're expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot - try your luck with something else.Final words : The plot is very , very strange and unusual and that 's probably the # 1 reason why most people who don 't appreciate this film hate it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" this is what i call a great movie. it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story. there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel , like live is.the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country ( jugoslavia ) on their way to the capital Belgrad. the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way , connect the people and the pigs that travel together. watch it and you gonna remember it for life ... its filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle.and another reason for its magic : it is hard to get ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray . That 's because it was easy to find . It was on every public domain label in the VHS era , and before that , a late night t.v. cult classic , double knee thigh slapper . Besides , HOW do you resist the title ? For late comers , a brief explanation of it 's merit : Florida wheeler dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films , dubbed them into English , then made a mint with them at the drive in . The Mexican ORIGINALS were weird enough to begin with ; American boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were cheerfully disregarded . Great , great set design and lighting were placed beside weird or laughable special effects . NOTHING in Hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange . Now , mix in Catholic influenced social conventions , Mexican folk lore , and we are not in Kansas anymore . Add to THAT the English scripts they were dubbed into . Most were written by Reuban Guberman , who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips ON SCREEN , not the literal translation . As a result the American soundtracks tended to run from overwrought to down right loopy . There 's even a fan web site for Murray that prints the best , most over the top lines for each movie . First time viewers to the films complain about the pacing , the purple prose , the production values and are told it 's SUPPOSED to be that way .. while the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws . It all must be very confusing if you don 't have a taste for it.This one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series ; THE AZTEC MUMMY and CURSE OF THE AZTEC MUMMY . All three are now available on the 3 disc AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION ( BCI ) and it 's about time . It has the K Gordon Murray version on one side , the original Mexican production on the other side . The contrast between the two is fascinating . A lot of the times the original Spanish is not much saner.ROBOT / MUMMY starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes , sort of .. continuity was tossed out the window in number two , and it 's downhill from there , logic wise . You don 't even get The Angel back , or any mention of him in this final episode . Names , places , even family trees switch between films . After a while , you start LOOKING for the continuity changes . By now , the series villain Doc Krupp is totally pig biting mad , nearly drooling with dementia and STILL wants to steal the Aztec breastplate . Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the AZTEC MUMMY floor show , and wanders out into the dark in her nightie to help find that doggone breastplate again . The mummy isn 't any happier with this then he was last time.The robot actually has a production credit . It was made by ' Viana & Co S.A. ' . I mention this , because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went walkabout . Nope.This was PLANNED . Wait until you see the controller it runs from . X box , where WERE you when Krupp NEEDED you ? ? ? The Robot LOOKS crushed to death at the end , but actually came back in two more Mexican made movies .. it had a FAN BASE .. All in all , a funny quirky finish to a three movie series . Sit back and enjoy . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I caught this little gem totally by accident back in 1980 or ' 81 . I was at a revival theatre to see two old silly sci-fi movies . The theatre was packed full and ( with no warning ) they showed a bunch of sci-fi short spoofs ( to get us in the mood ) . Most were somewhat amusing but THIS came on and , within seconds , the audience was in hysterics ! The biggest laugh came when they showed " " Princess Laia " " having huge cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head . She looks at the camera , gives a grim smile and nods . That made it even funnier ! You gotta see " " Chewabacca " " played by what looks like a Muppet ! It was extremely silly and stupid ... but I couldn 't stop laughing . Most of the dialogue was drowned out because of all the laughter . Also if you know " " Star Wars " " pretty well it 's even funnier--they deliberately poke fun at some of the dialogue . This REALLY works with an audience ! A definite 10 ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much younger . I loved it , and the Elton John music . I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid , and for some reason ( limited release ? ) I 've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me , and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back , I confess , however , that my kids ( in their 20 's ) have not experienced a similar emotional rush .

" I admit I have been a fan of Harrison Ford for many , many years now so it didn 't surprise me that I enjoyed his performance here . But I also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done . I don 't know whether I " " buy into " " Kristin Scott Thomas as a Congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman . I took notice of her in the first Mission Impossible . Although her part was small she stuck out on the screen.Here her and Ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash . They are seated together and this is where the plot takes off . Apparently Ford , a police detective in Wash D.C. , discovers that his wife was having an affair . He further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a New England Congresswoman.The story takes on many subplots as Ford and Thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages , the uncovering of deceipt , and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one.I think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" It seems that all people didn 't like Steven Seagal : Just take a look at his nomination list , there are only razzie awards nominations ( with one win ) for him , but I think he didn 't earn anything of it . I saw good movies with Steven Seagal , I saw bad movies with Steven Seagal . And THE PATRIOT ( 1998 ) is one of his best movies , nearly as good as UNDER SIEGE ( 1992 ) or HARD TO KILL ( 1990 ) . THE PATRIOT shows his activities to protect nature . Surely , this movie is not a great one , and I must say that there is more violence than I like , and why must Seagal 's best friend L. Q. Jones die the death of a victim ? The role of Dr. McClaren is one of Seagal 's best performances . He has , as always , a very good charisma . And in summary , THE PATRIOT is good entertainment-and with an average rating of only 4 points the most underrated movie of all time.Regards , Hans-Dieter , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A sweet little movie which would not even offend your Grandmother , " " Saving Grace " " seems cut from the same cloth as a half-dozen other British comedies over the past two years ... underdog is faced with adversity , finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him / herself in the process.Widowed and thus broke , Grace is a master gardener , and is enlisted to help her friend / employee Matthew grow his pot plant . He 's been doing it all wrong , so Grace helps him out . They realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot , which they can both benefit from . He enjoys smoking , she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage . Highlight is Grace travelling to London to deal some of her merchandise , dressed in what looks like the white suit John Travolta wore in " " Saturday Night Fever " " and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb . Blethyn is always watchable , and you can 't say that about a lot of people .. well , I can 't , anyway . Ferguson is very good , and Tcheky Karyo , who I liked in " " La Femme Nikita " , " is memorable . Not profoundly moving or insightful , but immensely entertaining , and at a brisk 90 minutes , feels like a walk with friends . 8 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child . He takes out his problems on his older sister , whom he murders at the beginning of the film . This is just the start of things to come from Michael Myers.Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who 's been studying Myers for years . He knows that something is different about him , something mysteriously evil . This evil will not be contained , and it cannot be stopped.After an escape from an institution , Myers tracks down his younger sister . If he kills her , there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy . But he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way . He manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs.There have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer . But this one started it all , sort of . If you think about it , most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing around half naked girls . Well , if it wasn 't for Halloween , those characters wouldn 't have haunted our dreams when we were children.Halloween 's director , John Carpenter , got a lot out of the horror movies of the ' 50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late ' 70s . This films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis , who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.This film may seem clich챕 today , but back then there wasn 't much out there like this . It 's been copied from and ripped off of , but Halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie . It still gives you chills listening to Carpenter 's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy Michael Myers . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins . The premise is that the nation 's dissidents ( hippies , musicians , protesters , pacifists , etc . ) are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison or running the course of Punishment Park . It 's a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an American flag , with police , National Guard , and various other authority figures in pursuit . The idea is , that if you make it to the flag , you 're set free . The tribunal consists of a bunch of conservative types , all condemning any behavior that is not like their own , and there is no result except a prison sentence or the option of " " Punishment Park " " for any of those on trial . There are a lot of things in this that still ring true today , which is quite disturbing in itself . The people running the course are promised water at the half-way point , which isn 't true , and the pursuing officials are mostly a sadistic bunch that are just out for a bit of target practice . This is not a very graphic film but it 's more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else . The scary thing is , it could happen . Not a very upbeat film but definitely worth seeing .

" Let 's get one thing straight , this gets an 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale , but out of the bad movie scale. this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose , where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous knockoff and shun 'd by everyone else . I went in with one promise from the movie , that there will be snakes on a train , and it Delivers ! The gore itself is really good , and the characters have awesome roles . Come on , it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls trafficking drugs , even a Electrical Engineer getting his pimp on ! You get to see some topless nudity , explosions , snakes , gore , and a Mexican main lead running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face ! ! As I mentioned and many others have , the movie pacing is a bit off , but respectable nonetheless . Movies like this keep our group tradition of banding together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this . There can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie . It could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as Alien Lock-down or Boa vs Python , but those are some big shoes to fill . A solid 7 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by Cagney and the other cast members namely : Dick Powell , ( Scott Blair ) who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler , ( Bea Thorn ) . James Cagney plays the role as Chester Kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing Prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater 's during the 1930 's . Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows . This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs . Joan Blondell , ( Nan Prescott ) gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty . Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career . Enjoy . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When people think of downtown Chicago they think of Walter Payton , Ditka and " " Da Bears " , " Ryne Sandberg , The White Sox breaking the curse in 2005 or the immortal Michael Jordan and his six championships ( and Finals MVP 's ) with the Chicago Bulls . Rarely in this generation do people think of the struggling side of Chicago , the ghettos , the drug infested streets and life in the urban housing projects during the 1970 's.One of television 's most formidable shows ever and a groundbreaking sitcom was " " Good Times " , " which I remember vaguely as a small child on CBS , and I enjoy regularly now on TV Land . " " Good Times " " was another Norman Lear classic , the producer that gave us " " The Jeffersons " , " the best African American sitcom of all time and " " All in the Family " " the greatest show of all time . " " Good Times " " brought out the hardships of the ghetto and the urban housing projects , and did so with charm , well written and thoughtful plots , and some wonderful acting especially by the matriarch and patriarch of this struggling ghetto family played by Esther Rolle and John Amos . The children in the supporting cast were also pretty good especially the ever popular Janet Jackson in her early years and Ralph Carter as Florida and James Evans youngest son whose character at a young age realizes that life is unfair , and he has to learn to stand on his own two feet.The eldest of the children J.J. played by Jimmy Walker is somewhat out of place on this show and is there mainly for comic relief . His emotional age is about 11 or 12 even though he looks like a guy in his early twenties . J.J. gets annoying , and it is a credit to the often nasty James Evans ( Amos ) that he never tells J.J. to get his own life , get a job and get out of the house . J.J. is an aspiring painter but unlike his younger brother is never serious about getting a college degree , or more important to the family getting a job to help support a household that is just above welfare status.Two classic episodes of Good Times was the one where the Janet Jackson character is running a fever of 104 , and Florida Evans is desperately seeking good medical help for her can 't afford anything but a clinic doctor who is very professional yet doesn 't want to give a family from the projects any more attention than she legally has to . The other episode is the one where James Evans can 't afford the rent a paltry low $ 104 a month . The Evans are about to get the largest of family setbacks , being thrown out of the projects with no where to go . Florida Evans goes downtown to the board of social services to try to get either a loan or a grant to help her family . But the government doesn 't consider her family poor because they have over $ 4,200 in assets for a family of five which is unfairly but unfortunately legally over the poverty line . James and the kids want to hustle for the money , but Florida is a person of great moral character and doesn 't want to do anything dishonest no matter how dire their predicament is . In the end the family does find a solution to keep their heads above water . " " Good Times " " a classic show from the 1970 's is about keeping you 're head above water in a cruel world . James and Florida Evans both work hard in menial jobs to try to bring their children up right and avoid the social stigma of welfare . I was too young to understand the message of the sitcom as a toddler in the 70s in its first airing on CBS , but I really enjoy the reruns on TV Land in 2006 . " " Good Times " " is one of the classic sitcoms from back in the day . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence . It was the Festival 's featured film and won Best Picture out of I think a couple hundred entries . The director and a few of the stars answered questions after the showing . One star , Suzy Lorraine , was even hotter in person than in the film , and she was an eye catcher in the movie.This film is independent , yet it has a lot of cinematic touches that give it a quality feel . It even has an original classical style musical score.I am a Savini fan and he 's the star villain here , in black cape , he 's more of an evil force than a real person I think . He is sucking the souls out of people and using them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of the Kingdom of God on Earth . In his view , Christ was all about suffering and Savini intends to make everyone suffer.The main story line that holds your interest is about a young doctor , Stefan , who is sent to investigate the strange events Savini is causing in an isolated town . He proposes to an aristocrat chick on the way but her SOB father tells him to get lost . Then he meets up with a strangely possessed but alluring country girl . I think she falls in love with him , but she also tries to kill him , as do a number of hot women in the film.I found the scenes shot in the woods to be the creepiest and most eye catching , with strange people along the road ( the evil little twin girls scared the hell out of me ) .The film has a lot to it , too much to list . There is a lot of blood , torture and gore . Hot chicks licking blood off of guys ' fingers . A terrified girl 's head explodes . That was unexpected . Throats get slit . Some brutal stabbings.Then they play it for laughs sometimes , poking a bit of fun at the whole evil black forest genre.If you 're a fan of Hammer films and Ingrid Pitt , it is fascinating to see her in this movie . She offs one of the leads by plunging a cross in his skull . Excellent . The guy who played " " Multiple Miggs " " in Silence of the Lambs is great in an axe fight.The movie is surreal and with the ending , I 'm not sure the events happened or if they were in Stefan 's head because of his rejection by his would-be fianc챕e . He returns in vengeance and that scene is brutal.The director also talked about the theme of religion being misused to back wars and killings . I can see that for sure , Savini 's view of religion was scary.This was a strangely exceptional movie with some stars like Savini and Pitt , a lot of good supporting cast including hot babes , great gore scenes , action , and all the time you 're wondering what the hell is going on and what is going to happen next.This deserves ten stars because it 's an excellent independent film effort , I don 't think it was low budget but it had to be way less than a big studio budget , and yet they managed to make something really attractive , unique and thought provoking . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is one of the better classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all basics for a highly enjoyable Wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies : Although his majesty , Mr. Kinski , is missing you still have young Joachim ' Blacky ' Fuchsberger , starring once again as the typical clever American ' womanizer ' , you have young Eddi Arendt in his best ( and just as well typical ) role ever - the cool , sophisticated British butler - and you have ( not so young anymore ) Lowitz as the melancholic yet very ' dry ' ironic ( and thus : highly entertaining ) police investigator . Furthermore you 'll get offered a freakish and very campy ' evil guy ' behind a frog mask ( hence the movie 's title ! ) , you 'll get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack , classic b-movie action scenes , partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives ( please remind the time of its origin ! ) , yelling scream queens , and on and on ...

" Let me start by saying overall I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight . I would give it a 7 / 10 . The Good : 1 . Acting : Samuel L Jackson is entertaining in almost any role . In this movie he doesn 't play his usual character , the type that is in control , instead Geena Davis is in control and Sam is along for the ride . His timing on his lines are great and he is the high point of the movie . Geena Davis also gives a great preformance as Samantha Caine / Charlie Baltimore . She is a believable action hero and I don 't think too many other actresses could pull off the preformance Geena Does . 2 . The Action : This is a very action packed movie . Things are pretty much always crashing or blowing up or someone is chasing someone else . The special effects are pretty good especially for being almost 8 years old . I can see some green screen stuff but it doesn 't detract too much from the acting.The Bad : 1 . Why did it take half of the movie to set up the plot ? This film needed to be edited in the script stage so that it didn 't run as long as it did . Maybe a drama or something can run this long but people really need to be into the movie the entire time to sustain it . I think that if you can stick out the first half you will be pleseantly suprized the second half . 2 . Geena Davis is cold weather and a tank top but she never seems cold . 3 . Some things are unrealistic . Sam Jackson flies through a giant sign after he is blasted out of a room and then he lands in a tree and just gets up . When you see this part you will think it 's a gag. overall fun movie 7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This review is long overdue , since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made . I 'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay , cinematography , acting , post-production , editing , directing , or any other aspect of film-making . It 's practically perfect in all of them 혯 a true masterpiece in a sea of faux " " masterpieces . " " The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema . I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute . Quite literally , Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels . A seemingly insignificant object may be shown 혯 a rack of dresses , two diaries , a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack , a bottle of pills , etc . 혯 but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more 혯 a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene ( or perhaps the movie in total ) , which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer 's intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront . Such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie , but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events occur in such a rapid-fire , relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness , lest they miss something important . In other words , the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films . How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this ? It 's quite simply the highest , most superlative form of cinema imaginable.The most commonly cited criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is nicely summarized by Zaphod B Goode , who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent , unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions . He posits that Ji-woon Kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that . In reality , however , nothing could be further from the truth . A Tale of Two Sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the EXACT occurrences of each and every scene of the film . If our good friend Zaphod had been paying attention , he would have noticed 혯 for example 혯 the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film . These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod 's assertion of complete subjectivity . The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them . Can Ji-woon Kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film ? I think not.Please note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics such as Zaphod that cannot " " get " " A Tale of Two Sisters , because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence . The movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer . Yes , this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving , but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture . You need only put them together . Remember , the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind 혯 he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that 혯 when completed 혯 bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe.Don 't misunderstand me . There are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design . Spider Forest ( 2004 ) , Perfect Blue ( 1998 ) and Donnie Darko ( 2001 ) are perfect examples of this . A Tale of Two Sisters is not . It 's ironic that Zaphod claims Darko to be more masterfully constructed than A Tale of Two Sisters , especially considering that Darko not only provides almost NO objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina clich챕 that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence . I 'm ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence , but the contrast is an important one . Although it does perplex me that Zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort . He apparently likes his " " intelligent " " films in the most superficial form possible . This is evident when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself . Just read the threads by Opiemar within the IMDb A Tale of Two Sisters Discussion Forum . Anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned OBVIOUS.I 'd like to say more , but I 've come to my 1,000 word limit . All that has been said here needed to be said . So be it now said ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a great film.I agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this . I had never heard of it or anyone in it ( excpet Mike from Friends ) .But it is great ! Eva , Lake and Paul give amazing performances . The humour is consistently dry and witty.Paul Rudd pretty much plays the mike character from Friends ( which works great ) . The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic ( I mean we are not talking ' Apocalypse Now ' here ) But the characters are likable , the story is engaging , the soundtrack , production and direction all work well.In all a great feel-good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets.Everyone has their own tastes but I really don 't understand the one star reviews for this . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Every star of the golden age of English films seems to be in this one and it was a joy to see them . And the greatest of them all , Richard Wattis , was as tremendous as ever . There is actually a plot that trundles along very nicely , there 's also some splendid jokes and comedic moments , but the key to this films triumph is the characters within it . Alastair Sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six foot , big-boned Scotsman could be the headmistress of a girl 's boarding school . George Cole , Beryl Reid and Irene Handl all have their moments but , with Alastair and Richard , the star of the show is Joyce Grenfell . She is an absolute one-off and brings a smile whenever she 's on the screen ... her rolling-walk and plum accent done to perfection . And for those playing the , that 's whassis name ' game , you can even spot Arthur Mullard , Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you look carefully . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you don 't like Mel Brooks , you won 't like this film . That 's a given . Why anyone wouldn 't like his films is unknown to me , but for those who can 't see the light , just avoid it.Everyone else : This is a classic . The entire cast is perfect : Carey Elwes is a dashing , clever , BRITISH Robin Hood , Amy Yasbeck overacts appropriately as Marion , Richard Lewis is his usual distracted , annoyed self , Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of fluster and violence as " " Mervyn " " the Sheriff of Rottingham , and Dave Chapelle , Eric Allan Kramer , Mark Blankfield , and the sadly underused Matthew Poretta are the perfect Merry Men.There are similarities to Spaceballs , Blazing Saddles ... and every other Mel Brooks movie . But why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn well ? The pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny again ... from the view of a 16 year old , at least . It 's complete and utter parody , every second a play for a laugh . Some of them don 't work , but most do , and well . I discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time I watched the film ! Of course , if being barraged by constant visual and verbal gags isn 't your style , you wouldn 't like this . This isn 't an Academy Award winner , it 's Mel Brooks . You know what it is when you 're getting into it . If you want nonstop laughter , surprisingly well-developed characters , and catchphrases to last a lifetime , watch this . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I never saw any of John Leguizamo 's stand-up before I watched Freak , and after seeing it again on HBO comedy recently it was better , more enlivening and with things that , at the age of 14 , I couldn 't understand quite before . Spike Lee did a wonderful job directing , keeping the visual angle up to par with Leguizamo 's theatrics and the style of personal storytelling ; it 's substance and style merging together but unobtrusively . We get Leguizamo 's rants about race and sex ( the bits about sex are classic ) , but a lot of it is about family , and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father . Even when things get dark in some of the stories , there 's something fresh or crazy or random that Leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh , and it works more often than not . If something does fall flat ( for me at any rate ) it might be his personality tics here and there . But overall , it 's the kind of fun material that isn 't heady , but is so true to itself that it stings . Find it if you can ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie could only originate in the 1970 's ! ! It 's a bizarre action movie set in a small California workers town . Some sort of mill or plant is closing down , so suddenly , rampant bad behavior is occurring in the streets ! The townsfolk 's are fed up ! So Ben Arnold ( Jan Michael Vincent ) , goes to another town to recruit his brother , Aaron , played by Kris Kristofferson . Aaron is a Vietnam Vet who looks and acts a little혚off balance .

It takes a while for people to catch on , and in a biblical Cain and Abel showdown , Vincent has to take on his older brother . There 's an interesting blue-collar sleaze atmosphere to this movie , which makes it interesting ( note the cock-fighting scene ! ) .

He finally comes to his senses 혯 his girlfriend , Victoria Principal , is brutally shot in the back & he himself is beaten up in his home . Kris Kristofferson is creepily effective as Aaron .

" It 's up there with Where 's Poppa , The Groove Tube , Putney Swope . It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period , a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan , hoist by by own petard , and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents . Totally absurd , its the life one sees through the magic glasses , seeing things as they " " really are " ... " I don 't think it is ever shown anymore .

He is amazed , surprised , and incredibly disappointed when the wraps come off : instead of a luscious lady , he has captures a middle ages suburban housewife who talks and talks and talks . The film is full of vignettes of the commuters life , the suburban life , the city officials , and all the attitudes so dearly held . It pushes the limits of comedy , such as magical reality might push a drama , much as Daffy Duck is able to draw on imaginative scenes to demonstrate his plight or desires , all at the very edge of plausibility .

" I remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993 . I was 8 at the time , and now at the age of 22 it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it.The 90 's all of a sudden seem so far away , what a great decade . Anyway I used to watch MonsterVision all the time , as I am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films . It was like the 90 's version of Chiller Theater . If MST3K can get DVD 's why not Joe Bob 's show , at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative . A lot of Joe Bob 's comments and info on the films were just hilarious . Most of the movies shown on the show were B or C grade but it showed a lot of A house films as well like the Hammer films from England which are Top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of Ray Harryhausen . Many were oddball flicks that you wouldn 't see anywhere else like the the Japanese Sci-Fi movies besides of course Godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like Metal Storm and Motel Hell . With the new Decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors , I think MonsterVision would be a good show for IFC to pick up , since they already have a hit with the IFC grind house show . I 'm sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day , I guess will have to wait and see . Until then " " thats Great Television " " ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Synopsis : Andreas ( Trond Fausa Aurvaag ) finds himself alone on a coach , getting dropped off on a desert land , at what seems the last stop of his journey . He doesn 't know how he arrived there , but a welcome sign has been erected for him . After momentarily pondering his whereabouts , he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life . He then enters a world different to the one he came from . As Andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant , he senses that his surroundings are a bit too uniformed for his liking . As he takes his first lunch break , he instantly notices that everyone in the city walks around in grey suits . On this same day , he sees a fellow businessman dead on some fencing spikes , of what looks like an act of suicide . The strange thing is , the city folk pay no attention to this horrific act and walk on by as if it never happened . It is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitised , and their ability to distinguish between anything humane or inhumane is absent . To help Andreas settle in , he is invited to go out with his co-workers to a local nightclub . The club appears to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night .. and as Andreas drinks his sorrows aways , he realises that no matter how much he drinks , the alcohol has no effect on him . As he tells these observances to a stranger in the men 's room , a man in a toilet cubicle starts to utter words which have been on Andreas ' mind all along . Realising that this man is thinking what he is , he follows him to his house , and notes where he lives for future reference . The plot predictably evolves with Andreas wanting an escape . He seeks out the man he once followed ... hoping that he could lead him to becoming human again ... but is it too late ? My thoughts : This norwegian film is something which everyone should see , as it holds the answer to the big question ! What is the meaning of life ? ( well , close enough ) . The film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today 's working man ( or woman ) . It 's sole purpose is making people realise that life is too short to be materialistic . It tries to show that small clich챕 things , such as the sound of children playing , should not be taken for granted , because the moment you stop hearing that sound , is the moment you 're one step away from becoming a robot . The ending of the film reiterates what happens when its too late to escape the mundane routine you 've now become used to . You start to adopt the saying of ' if it ain 't broke , don 't fix it ' , and become too comfortable to take a risk of change.Even though this film is not to be taken as a piece of realism ... its message is more than real . The lack of empathy conveyed in the film , and that of which Andreas sees , is a bold statement of what life can become . The director , Jens Lien has put together a film , which in any other director 's hands would have failed . This is a fine piece of cinematic genius , and i eagerly await to see what he does next.The lead role , played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag is perfectly cast . Representing the average Joe , Trond provides a good catalyst in making this picture darkly humorous . The supporting actors also do an apt job , and for some reason , i feel that Keanu Reeves would have been perfect in this film , as most of the supporting cast required their acting to be emotionless.The score for this film was beautifully composed . The recurring theme was always a delight to listen to , and it provided a very sombre but welcomed feel to the movie.Set for a release date in the UK for 25th May 2007 , i will definitely be going to re-live this experience on the big screen . This film has gained its way in my top 10 ... now quickly becoming my top 20 ! It has some shocking scenes , and is darkly humorous throughout ... A MUST -SEE ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little Gothic nail-biter . She accepts a position as secretary to a London society dowager ( played imperiously by Dame May Witty ) and her creepy son ( the effete and bothersome George Macready ) . Before she knows it , she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor she 's never seen before , where Witty and Macready are calling her Marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that she 's Macready 's mad wife . Of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds , and even though we know Julia has to eventually escape her trap , director Joseph Lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how she 'll manage it . " " My Name Is Julia Ross " " has nothing stylistically to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period , but I was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe-string budget and B-movie pedigree . There are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat , and I found myself really rooting for Julia as she caught on to the scheme underfoot and began to outsmart her captors . In any other Gothic thriller , the heroine would have swooned , screamed and dithered , waiting for her hero to come and save her . So I can 't tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herself.Well done.Grade : B + , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As others have commented , I checked this out after Siskel and Ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year . What a gift . I then went out to buy it , just so that I could loan it out.Best quote ? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone ( Cage ) is on top of his cab . When Cage peers down , he apologizes . " " I 'm sorry if I scared you . " " Yoakum thrusts his pistol in Cage 's face with " " Does THIS look like I 'm scared ? " " Great bit of humor after an exciting ( and temporary ) escape.There really was a sense of fun to this . The constant sighting of the " " Welcome to Red Rock " " sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake . The music created a hunting , eerie quality to the film reminiscent of " " Twin Peaks " . " Unlike " " Twin Peaks " , " though , it doesn 't spoil things by going too far into the outlandish , needing to " " top " " itself.I admit watching the credits 15-20 times . You see , they had Yoakum 's " " Thousand Miles from Nowhere " " ( perfectly chosen ) playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor . . with snow-capped mountains in the distance . This was incredible , fluid framing . Further , I 've never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film . Also , it totally fit the story . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I agree that Capital City should be on DVD . I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot . It was nice to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change . I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in . I can 't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes . I liked William Armstrong as Hudson 's flamboyant charming friend in the series . When they aired this show in the New York City area , it was always late at night or at off times . The show is less than an hour long . I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting . I didn 't care for Sylvia but missed the actress , Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season . I felt this show took chances and often it worked . It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London . The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts . I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British . I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role . I felt this show should have lasted longer . I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour . They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a hit in America . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" What a tribute to his father ! He set out on a quest to learn more about a man whom he knew little of , and by the end of the journey , I believe Nathaniel Kahn is content with what he learned and personally felt . The film is 5 years in the making , and a quarter of a century after his death , Louis I. Kahn 's total commitment in his work - consistent strong desire to build buildings that are meaningful to humanity and timeless to the whole world , with insight into his life is proudly depicted by his son Nathaniel in the documentary " " My Architect : A Son 's Journey " . " The film is by no means an anthology of Louis ' work . There are plenty of books and archived materials that have records of Louis Kahn 's projects and buildings . This documentary works like a mystery , writer-director and co-producer Nathaniel Kahn was searching for the man whom he briefly knew as his father . The film is in chapters . In " " Heading West , " " we 're at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies at La Jolla , California . It 's a sight worth beholding - Kahn 's integral concept of building and environment , optimizing light for the scientists at work is amazing . From a former colleague who worked with ' Lou ' 35 years ago , we hear about his meticulous attention to detail , also how ' rambunctious ' he could be - certainly didn 't mince words in his criticism . A memorable scene is when the camera pulled back wide and we see Nathaniel skating around at the plaza area of the Salk Institute - a tiny figure , like a child happily playing in the bowl of his father 's hands . The " " Immigrant " " segment brought us to meet Anne Tyng , the architect who collaboratively worked with ' Lou ' and also bore him a daughter , Alex . Now at 80 , Tyng 's return with Nathaniel 's film crew to the Bath House project at Trenton , New Jersey , was nostalgic . In " " Go to sea , " " we get to see the Barge for American Wind Symphony Orchestra - all made of steel , and meeting Robert Boudreau , who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally told him he 's ' Lou 's ' son . Boudreau was touched , he said he had seen Nathaniel when he was six , with his Mom ( Harriet Pattison ) , and he was not to tell anyone that Lou had a son . It was a ' chokingly ' emotional moment of reunion.Like his father " " The Nomad , " " Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem , and learned about the Synagogue project that his father began but not realized . He visited the wailing wall , and seeing his yarmulke kept falling off / being ' breezed off ' his head gave me a sense that he need not be ' totally ' Jewish to be his father 's son . We continue with sitting down with his two half-sisters at the " " Family Matters " " segment . We also hear him conversing with his Mom at Maine , and from talking to previous office personnel at his father 's office , we come to know how his father intensely worked and practically lived there , sleeping on a carpet on the office floor , weekends and all . " " The End of the Journey " " brought us to Ahmedabad , India , to the Indian Institute of Management building . Talking with architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation . In the end , Nathaniel found a very much alive Louis Kahn , his father - his spirits live within him . This documentary is very much a tear-jerker for me . I was teary-eyed most of the time - it was very touching and am in awe of the man , the architect and his son , and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings . Louis I. Kahn wanted to give his love to the ' whole world , ' juggling work and three families ( you might say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration going ) . As Shamsul Wares , the architect at the Capital of Bangladesh complex ( completed 9 years after ' Lou 's ' death ) so poignantly noted : Louis Kahn has given the people of Bangladesh a lot , spending time at Bangladesh , understanding the culture of the place and people - as well as giving them democracy through what he has achieved , and for such a dedicated man , usually the people close to him he 'd often miss seeing . It seems the price of being great comes with inevitable personal sacrifices . This film reminds me of King Vidor 's " " The Fountainhead " " 1949 ( good dramatic story in B / W with music by Max Steiner ) , based on Ayn Rand 's novel , with Gary Cooper as the uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals , and Patricia Neal as the parallel supportive woman in his life . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
... " scratch it . Just as African 's created rhythms with the jawbone of an ass and Virgin Islanders welded oil drums into ear pleasing steel bands , so did urban DJ 's itch to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression . " " Scratch " " is a wholly unnarrated documentary which will take you to the heart of the hip-hop / rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism , the art of scratching vinyl , and the ultimate DJ / MC contempo entertainment expression . The film reveals some surprisingly intelligent and articulate " " Scratchers " " with startlingly unique abilities in concert and competition where the beat meets the street .

" The emotional powers and characters of Dominick and Eugene are the things that Hollywood doesn 't make anymore . This is one of the most emotional , sensitive , and heart-felt movies that I have ever seen ! Roy Liotta , Tom Hulce , and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis , deliver Oscar Winning caliber performances ! There are not enough words to express how great this movie is . Sure , people who are not into sentimental movies may not care as much as the rest of us about Dominick and Eugene , but for the rest of us , this movie goes right to the heart and sole of compassion and humanity . You will never forget this film , EVER ! * * * * * SPOILERS BELOW * * * * * The simple yet eloquent story is masterfully told . Eugene is a med-school intern who faces long hours and a demanding work load at the hospital . His fraternal twin brother Dominick ( born 12 minutes earlier ) is a little slow and awkward because of brain damage due to a victim of abuse by their father . ( A heartbreaking moment when this is found out in the film that will leave you in tears ! ) Eugene ( a.k.a " " Geno " " ) faces a painful dilemma . He must decide whether to finish medical school , which would mean accepting his residency in another city and leave Dominick ( a.k.a " " Nicky " " ) behind , or forfeit the rest of his education to take care of him . Nicky helps pay his brother 's med-school tuition by working as a trash collector.The questions of ethics , morals , and responsibilities are masterfully blended in this landmark movie . Just when Gino thinks Nicky might be making progress toward independence , Dominick turns around and winds up doing things like helping out a drug dealer , or tying to use a faulty cord that he finds at the dump on an electrical appliance.Larry , is " " The Character " " and Nicky 's partner on his garbage route who fills gullible Dominick 's head with all kinds of stories like Geno and Jennifer ( his girlfriend , whom he is tutoring in Clinical Pharmacology ) going to Atlantic City and gambling away all their money . But deep down , you can see that Larry cares for him . On their rounds , Nicky also befriends a little boy , whom we find out has also been beaten by his father . An end result is also tragic and the pain that you see on Nicky 's face when it happens , speaks volumes.The sensitivity that the two brothers share for each other can not be overstated enough . All Nicky wants to do is be loved and look for acceptance in anyway he can . ( i.e he goes to church , loves Hulk Hogan ) Geno loves Nicky more than anything in the world . But can his brother become independent enough so that Geno can pursue his dream of becoming a doctor ? A brilliant film that should have gotten tons more recognition than it deserved , but unfortunately came out around the same time as Rain Man , which dealt with a similar issue . However , I like Dominick and Eugene better because it has a far stronger emotional component . Be forewarned that this movie is aimed right at the tear-ducts , so have Kleenex handy ! What a film ! ! ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" William Powell 's final outing as Philo Vance occurs in The Kennel Murder Case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind . It 's all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why.The Philo Vance murders by S.S. Van Dine were most popular at the time and the clever Mr. Van Dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder . This is why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios putting them out . Had Bill Powell not gone on to greater fame with MGM as Nick Charles of the Thin Man series , he would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vances . It turns out that Powell had entered his little terrier Captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim . As usual Powell shows up Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was found.I did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how . Powell has a lovely group of suspects , as extensive as what normally is in a Thin Man mystery . People like Paul Cavanaugh , Helen Vinson , Ralph Morgan , Mary Astor , fill their cast roles well.Warner Brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the Thirties with James Stephenson in his one and only outing as Philo Vance . It doesn 't hold a candle to this one.As this is the only Powell Philo Vance that is out on VHS or DVD by all means see this one or acquire it if you can . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a fan of the book , this work is fantastically adapted ; remaining true to the source materials , and demonstrating an honest respect for the literary work . The intrigues translate well to film by virtue of Ron Howard 's good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity.I like Hanks as Robert Langdon . His portrayal is genuine and earthy , with only the barest glint of the Kip we all knew and loved , back in " " the day . " " He is a good dramatic actor and , while I miss his comedic efforts , I do enjoy his more serious performances.The subject matter is no less controversial than the DaVinci Code , and the Vatican seems to never learn their lesson . As with the aforementioned film , the Holy See issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global Catholic boycott of the film , which of course , generated millions in ticket sales.Although the story of the " " God Particle " " was played down dramatically , and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction , the fiction that was left , was entertaining and extremely well done . And , the truth be known , people who have not read the book , will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story , as the screen version carries the main story well on its own.In fact , it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise , in order to enjoy this second , which should have been a prequel in all honesty , although that does not lessen the effectiveness , nor does it meddle with the continuity or flow of this second work.All in all , this is good for a Friday / Saturday night 's viewing , although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones.It rates an 8.8 / 10 from ... the Fiend : . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sometimes it is difficult to watch films with subtitles ( in this case Danish ) but the watching is worth it . As the story progresses , the reasoning for the choice of two sisters , to take care of their father , is questionable but their society is different . Their choice leaves them alone until a French woman comes . There may be a question on why the French woman came to their place to stay and this is never fully developed . The feast which happens later as a result of unexpected funds from France is a source of unusual pleasure to all who attend and something they have not experienced before . It provides a fitting thank you for the kindnesses given to the guest .

" I disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as " " just " " entertainment . Set right after the carefree , roaring 20s , during the early days of the Great Depression , Dance , Fools , Dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale , with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times . Yet this fast-paced and tightly-plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale.In the 30s , Hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining * and * enlightening audience-pleaser after another , all without wasting a frame of film . Dance , Fools , Dance -- one of * four * films that Harry Beaumont directed in 1931 -- is barely 80 minutes long , yet its characters are well developed , its story never seems rushed , and despite its many twists in plot , the audience is never left behind.With the lone exception of Lester Vail as flaccid love interest Bob Townsend , the supporting cast is uniformly strong . Worthy of note are William Bakewell as Crawford 's brother , Cliff Edwards ( best known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket ) as reporter Bert Scranton , and Clark Gable in an early supporting role as gangster Jake Luva.But this is Joan Crawford 's film , and she absolutely shines in it . Made when she was just 27 , this lesser-known version of Crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work . However , here is proof that long before she took home an Oscar for Mildred Pierce , Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word , a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself.Score : EIGHT out of TEN , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Shtrafbat is the story only Russians could tell about the Second World War . The largest front of the whole conflict has been , ironically , the least appearing subject on the silver screen after the war . While the Western Allies war-effort has been pictured in almost every possible detail and manner , the East has been left out or the job has been left to only some old propaganda movies of little else than historical footage value.There is no chance that Shtrafbat could compete with Band of Brothers in every detail but neither you want to look at the screen with examining petty visual effects in mind . That the soldiers are Russians is enough big reason to forgive the less eye-captivating battle scenes and you can concentrate on the story that is the most interesting . So much different was the war in the Eastern front , and the nature of the Russian army , that you might wish people to produce more dramatizations from the other fronts , and of armies.Shtrafbat is no way perfect , but it has some rare specialties that augment the overall rating . It tends to crush myths people have about the Second World War , the true heroes were Russian people and not their leaders who sent them to missions where they could only perish . Another great myth bust is that it presents the enemy , who does not pick up his gun , as an equal human being - an advancement that has been difficult to try in many acclaimed films as well . Shtrafbat shows how the war in the eastern front was a war of survival and how the clash of the -isms grinds people into dust . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Kalifornia " " is a good Hollywoodish odyssey of suspense and terror which tells of two couples who drive cross-country to California to share the cost of gas : A pair of losers ( Lewis & Pitt ) and two wannabee artists , a photographer and a writer ( Duchovny & Forbes ) . Pitt " " nails " " his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller . A good watch for those into psycho-killer flix . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Not sure one can call this an anti-war film , it shows war at an elite level . These are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it . Even when they are pacifist , they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their foes , even if it does go against being a pacifist . The movies is slow and rather uneventful and in many ways is rather tame as war movies go-more so by todays standards , no body parts flying off as in modern movies . It is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level . This is more of a thinking man 's movie . Once you start to watch you don 't want to miss anything . The thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions , is what the movie is about- not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline . This maybe called a war triller.If you are into the skill of war , if you are into reading or seeing programs about the SAS and so on , YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! Comparable movies are The Hill ( 1965 ) with Sean Connery , 49th Parallel ( 1941 ) with an all star cast , The Naked and the Dead ( 1958 ) with Cliff Robertson . All are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level . Enjoy ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie .... except when the bras and bullets started flying . I have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyone .... but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep . I recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics . Also try Fritz the cat and the NINE Lives of Fritz the Cat . If I 'm correct Ralph Bashki did that movie too.It involves a cat that goes through hard times with family , streets , jobs , etc . When I was old enough I rented all of these movies out . Because Coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as Street Fighter . Ralph Bashki also made Cool World starring a very young Brad Pitt . Heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When you 're watching Distant you know you 're not watching a French movie , there 's little sex and it 's mostly elliptical and people don 't talk that much here , there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations , just to let you make sense of what 's going on . It doesn 't look American either , there aren 't any car chases or shoot-outs or violence , unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe . At times , the relatively long-held medium-distance shots may remind you of ' contemplative ' Asian cinema , but just reminds you , the director doesn 't push things to the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers but then again , this is not a Taiwanese movie , it 's a Turkish movie . I don 't know what that means , I don 't even know if that 's supposed to mean something.The movie doesn 't have a plot proper and yet , those few lines , those somewhat long-held shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening , a sense of ' plot ' , for lack of a better word , that grows on you . By the end of the movie you may get the feeling you 're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award-material . But then it doesn 't try to be anything it is not . A fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners , a stellar and very funny performance by Peter O 'Toole , a grounding and down to earth performance from Joan Plowright . The band 's performance was on the spot , each one playing their role in a deft , comical manner . The music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely . From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads . A good example is the comment about the " " strange baseball-like game " , " well my dear American , that was cricket -from which baseball is derived- and the explaining of it to the ignorant US band was very funny for those that do know cricket . Also no , you were not supposed to wince when Carl broke a window ; it was funny how Lord Foxley said " " oh yes ! " " to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time " " oh no " " also referring to the money . Jeez , it seems that every joke must be explained to some people ...

" Surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of Disney 's straight to video throw away sequels . Like the previous sequel ( The Lion King 2 ) I was glad that Disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation . The plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull . To break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences , which much like the jokes , range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge . For the most part the MST3K-like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and really don 't add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hour-long flashback . The new characters are at least likable , and the old characters are out doing their thing so I can 't fault them there . Overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filler between the more serious Lion King titles . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Having heard of Modesty Blaise before , but never having read a novel or a comic strip , my wife and I liked the film a lot . It delivered , in a captivating way , a good introduction to the character and her background.Although it has some action flick elements , it is much more an intimate play , excellently written . Sadly , this is also , where a major drawback of the movie is revealed . An intimate play lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered . While Alexandra Staden did an excellent job as Modesty Blaise , her counterpart Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - as the villain Miklos - did not . Smiling his way through the plot as if it is an extend toothpaste commercial , he fails to build up an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece . The supporting cast is somehow similar , from some stereotyped gangsters and sluts to decent performances from Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I recently got the chance to view " " The Waterdance " , " and quite liked it . I don 't really understand why its called that as there isn 't really any dancing going on there , except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end .

The story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman , which is a very sweet story.Unfortunately , you don 't get to see movies like that today . Im not " " stuck in a time warp " , " im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today , but I really think the movie industry is deteriorating and there 's much we can learn from old movies-by old movies i mean anything from 1920-1998 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Caroline Bender ( Hope Lange ) is just killing time getting a job . Her real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby . April ( Diane Baker ) is too innocent to stay that way for long and falls in love too easily , a dangerous combo . Greg ( Suzy Parker ) is a go-getter and wants to be an actress . All three are doomed for dramatics in ' The Best of Everything ' , a 1959 soap opera / morality play / sometimes solid movie that is aging by the second.Set in the cut-throat world of paperback publishing , its not as trashy as " " Valley of the Dolls " " but not as vanilla as " " Three Coins in the Fountain . " " The men in the mix - Brian Aherne , Stephen Boyd , Louis Jourdan and Robert Evans - are slick , well-dressed and no good , for the most part . Aherne is the resident sexual offender - will pinch anything walking by , and makes unwanted advances right and left . His character is offensive as hell , but its not played seriously at all . Harassment hadn 't been discovered yet , I guess . Boyd works there , too , although you never see him actually doing anything . He 's too busy being older , wiser and drunker . Evans is abroad just so Diane Baker can suffer in style - he 's a rich kid who 's gotten her in ' trouble ' so instead of marrying her , as promised , he 's taking her to get an ' operation . ' Jourdan is a director who mistakenly has an affair with Parker . They share a fight scene which is fairly no-holds barred , in a movie like this anyway , but the scene is ultimately ruined by Parker 's histronics . She ends up nearly stalking him , and she really didn 't deserve such a lousy fate , her bad acting notwithstanding.Joan Crawford breathes fire as Amanda Farrow , the resident ' witch ' who is automatically rude and dismissive of any of her legion of secretaries . Well they are younger , aren 't they ? Isn 't that sufficient reason to hate a person ? Caroline doesn 't think so , as she admirably stands up to Miss Farrow every chance she gets . Crawford only gets to let loose once , when she tells her married boyfriend ' you can your rabbit-faced wife can both go to hell ' and slams down the phone . You never get to see the poor soul who dare crosses her . Martha Hyer 's ' storyline ' , as it were , is extremely weak , and she is painfully over-the-top as an unmarried mother . Short of wearing a huge " " W " " ( for ' whore ' ) on her cardigan , she walks around like a pathetic mess for most of her screen time . Even worse , she is not given the courtesy of having it all ' tied up ' , one way or the other , at the end . It won 't matter that much , but still .. Its painfully obvious this all took place in a totally different world . People were nicer to one another for the most part and work was not a drag but something exciting , for a girl from outside NYC anyway.One unconvincing drunk scene aside , Hope Lange helps it seem reasonably real as Caroline , who at least has more than one side to her character . I admire that women are seen having an opinion , a chance and a choice . Not that its not wrapped in a nice bow , but it makes some points for equality . In 1959 that was probably noteworthy and possibly controversial . 7 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This last Dutch speaking film of Verhooven made me laugh good . As a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie I can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses . I haven 't read Gerard Reves book , on which the film is based , but I still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat self-conceited poet / writer who gets his ( in a way - no spoiling here ) . An anti-hero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions , as has he . All this in a superbly packaged cinematography , Paul Verhopven manages to turn the otherwise rather cute " " gesellich ( ? ) " " Dutch locations into a suspenseful film-noir setting , impressive work ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ugh , what an embarrassing episode last night !

" In fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasn 't of The Gun being melted down like in the movie ! No , I 'm not some NRA shill .

" This is a racist movie , but worthy of study and enjoyment . First time through it the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe & Dad . They have a relaxed , peaceful thing going , what with her still at home about to graduate from high school , and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something . Second time through you realize how horribly the sister 's husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar . He takes it , it 's the thing to do these days , and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather . In that same scene the sister 's blues song is a real tear-jerker if you 're the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music . Her performance feels like the climax of the story ; a blues story with the good guys being " " people of color " " in their element in backwoods , SC . Meanwhile , all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies . That 's cool , long as you recognize it as fiction . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" BELL WITCH HAUNTING ( aka THE HAUNT ) is an American horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period 1817 to 1821.This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH : THE MOVIE , a movie starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events . However , I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw ! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer 's chilling performance in Friday THE 13TH . As such , I believe that even on a bad day , she 'd pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as THE HAUNT.With regard to my heading , this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing . It is painful to watch because it is just downright boring.Reading the positive reviews for this movie , I could only identify three possibilities . The first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way . The second possibility - the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed . The final possibility - none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise.The setting for the plot is Robertson County , Tennessee . James Johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the Bell Witch . The story is told as a series of flashbacks . A series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of John Bell and his family . It soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all.On the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair , albeit one based on real events.Where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however , just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong . And then some ! First , the acting . The acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board . This factor does the most damage to the production , undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer . The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent . I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines . Unfortunately , this voice began to become very annoying very quickly ! I may not have been alive in the 1800s , but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this " " ghost " " does ! Second , the direction . The direction is haphazard and very uneven . Some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director . Nothing is done with the camera , with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary . The atmosphere is equally flat . A vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences . Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them . I 'll give one example . In one scene , the spirit attacks someone . See the scene for yourself . It 's almost funny - almost.Third , the script . Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences , it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring . Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story . This movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story . Whilst this style was also the case with British movies from the British horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s , it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works . Peter Cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers . The same cannot be said of the actors in THE HAUNT.Finally , the humour . The ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating . An obese boy is the butt of many jokes . One particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet . This scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing ! The only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes . The decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity . The costumes were also well chosen.Overall , THE HAUNT is an appalling movie . It is not even in the " " so bad it 's good " " league . It is instead just boring . I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague . Don 't even bother seeing it for free ! I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch . But it really couldn 't be any worse than THE HAUNT . Could it ? I 'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down.In the meantime , I would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting . THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE , THE CHANGELING , RINGU , THE GRUDGE ( Japanese original ) and ONE MISSED CALL ( Japanese original ) are good places to start . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The more I watch Nicholas Cage , the more I appreciate him as an actor . Watching this movie now ( in 2005 ) , I can see that it doesn 't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s . I don 't really think it can be considered a film noir , but it is pretty dark at times , due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters.Typical performances from each of the three main actors , who all did a good job with their roles . I thought , however , that Hopper and Boyle 's characters were left undeveloped , as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it . Hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy . The plot is really good , and although I found some parts to be very unrealistic , there were parts where I had to hand it to the director ( i.e. when he first sees the sheriff ) . All in all , this movie is definitely worth watching . * * * 1 / 2 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow - most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screen.The shift from the early days as a New-York based black-American phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture ( and largely West Coast-based ) is profiled well.The humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument , but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex . These DJs take the required skills for any musical instrument - dexterity , rhythm and timing , among others - and apply them to a new technology with several more variables.DJ Qbert 's comment that he pictures what " " music " " must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out , seemingly silly at first , makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create ! Some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain ' stars ' and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider hip-hop culture .

" This was really a " " nightmare " " of a film ; i saw it about nine years ago on cable TV and haven 't forgotten it since . Pixote is a 10-year old boy who lives in the streets of Sao Paulo ( Brazil ) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends Lilica , Dito and Chico ; they steal , pimp , sell drugs and murder in order to survive each day ... In the first half of the film Pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses every kind of abuse from the older inmates and guards to the rest of the kids ; one night , Lilica 's boyfriend is killed after a beating , so Pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot . The rest of the film shows Pixote 's descent into a criminal life ; he doesn 't show any feelings or remorse after killing someone , maybe because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he lives ... But there is , however , a gentle scene in the middle of the film ; Pixote and his friends are at the beach , missing ( and wishing ) one of his friends from the reformatory was there . I thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events ... the boys are obviously longing not only for their friend , but for a better life . Director Hector Babenco 's " " Pixote " " is a brave and depressing film that doesn 't shy away from showing the harshest reality many people -including myself- tend to ignore or misunderstand . This film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For fans of 1970s Hammer type horror films , this movie should be a treat . The only thing I didn 't like about the film was the fact that Peter Cushing was wasted on the worst episode . In general , however , this is a solid , spooky little movie . If this is not Amicus ' best film , it 's certainly one of them . The best episode , rightfully saved for last , is the one featuring Jon Pertwee as a horror film actor--it is really excellent . As good as Pertwee was in this role , it 's hard to believe he didn 't do more of these types of movies . All in all , this is an entertaining movie , which scared the heck out of me as a child , and which still gives me the creeps to this day . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was very impressed with the latest production from Mick Molloy . As a fan of his , I was used to a different kind of humour than displayed here . He wisely opted with a more subtle , broad style of comedy in Crackerjack , rather than his usual low brow , in-your-face ramblings . It is , at times , inconsistent and un-even , but a decent script works past that , and makes for some entertaining viewing . Directed by Paul Moloney ( who has directed almost every Australian TV series imaginable ) , Crackerjack tells the story of Jack Simpson , a bloke that belongs to his local bowls club for the sole reason of parking . When the club hits financial trouble , he is forced to bowl competitively in an attempt to raise the funds to save the club from becoming a poker machine haven . A familiar , and successful formula , that is handled well . There is no denying that the film owes it 's success to the great casting of Molloy . He seemed to have a great rapport with Samuel Johnson , and excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy , and while the character is probably not a far stretch from his own personality , you can 't help but wonder why he hadn 't tried his arm at film earlier . To smooth out the in-experienced cast , the delightful Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter support , and often steal their scenes . They are two fine actors and the pair cruise through their roles with ease . Had it not been for the huge success of ' My Big Fat Greek Wedding ' , Crackerjack would have made it to number 1 at the Australian box office , but when you consider what he film is about and who is involved , even making it to number 2 was an outstanding effort . All in all , a witty , feel-good movie . Great cast , great crew , and a great soundtrack , combine to make one of the better Australian films of 2002 . 7 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Miles O 'Keeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty Ator in this the first sequel to the original film.What can I say ? - This pretty much represents B-Movie Nirvana ! The plot is ludicrous , the script is terrible , the acting is hammy throughout , the special effects .... well let 's not even go there ! - all in all this movie is a veritable delight ! Highlights of the film include Ator and Thong ( his mute companion , not his undergarments ) being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave ( certainly saved on the fx budget there ! ) , Ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid , and of course , the infamous hangliding scene ! There 's one question I have though ...... at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator supposedly destroys the Geometric Nucleus ( as the narrator tells us ) ...... how in the hell did Ator destroy it and manage get out alive ? ! Did he fashion some form of primitive timer / detonator or something ?

" This is one of my three all-time favorite movies . My only quibble is that the director , Peter Yates , had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene , but the performances were so great I forgive him.Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely marvelous ; brilliant . The script is great , giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during World War II ( and , therefore , what it was like in the 30s as well ) . Lots of great , subtle touches , lots of broad , overplayed strokes , all of it perfectly done .

" The plot is predictable . It has been done many times in other movies . You have competing summer camps in this one : the rich kids vs. the underachievers competing for " " bragging " " rights in the typical camp contests , while the kids and consolers pursue pranks , sex , and " " a good time ! " " " " Are You Ready For The Summer ? " " Meatballs is the first ( and best ) summer camp movie for feel-good comedy . As others have posted , it 's no Citizen Kane , but this type of movie isn 't meant to be . The film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic one-liners of Bill Murray . His scenes with a camper where he tries to raise the kid 's self-esteem are very good . Bill 's one-liners throughout the film are very funny.I also like that this movie isn 't dirty or explicit like so many other " " teens at camp " " movies today . There is some mild sexual innuendo and maybe one or two cuss words in the entire film . But Meatballs is the type of teen movie that is actually appropriate for the younger crowd . It 's rated PG.This is a movie that you have to see a few times to get all of the jokes ! When Bill Murray is on the screen or making one of his classic " " PA Announcements " " you are drawn to the film . Bill seems to carry the movie all by himself . But he does it so well , that when you see Meatballs , you will realize that this is the film that made him a star ! A side note to this review is to avoid ALL of the Meatball movie sequels . They are horribly bad . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I loved this film ! Fantastically original and different ! A solid , intense , hard-core and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of ( dark ? ) humor . If you 're tired of the typical , overdone , ridiculous Hollywood B.S. movies , how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot em up gun fights that insult your intelligence can we take , then this film is for you . Fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable , and solid performances by all actors , not a weak character or performance in the film . Skip Woods ' film is a breath of fresh air and I applaud his originality and efforts , his film has the feel of a cross between a Quentin Tarantino and a Cohen brothers film ( not a bad mix at all in my opinion ) . This movie grabs you by the throat and doesn 't let go , there 's nothing boring or bubble gum about this film . The only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it , everyone I 've recommended it to has thanked me and shared my opinion on it . This film is a welcomed change / alternative from the canned Hollywood mainstream garbage being produced today , even with their big name actors , big explosions , special effects and huge budgets . It 's a terrifically wild , intense , violent , graphic , humorous and raw ( I mean that in a good way , no phony Hollywood polish here ) ride .

Well as a life long fan of Kung Fu films I have to say this is one of the best I have ever seen . Sure there is nothing special about the plot but man does it entertain . As does most movies of the genre . This film is packed with action and does not boar its viewers . It 's so damn fun when I watch I have a smile on my face the whole time . This also has an impact on future films like Kill Bill . ( Many of Kill Bill 's Sound effects come from this film for example . ) This is essential viewing for all knew viewers in Kung Fu . Form open to close this film is filled with fights that really are some of the better I have seen in the genre . There are few Kung Fu films out there that measure up to the sheer magic and entertainment of this film .

It should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese . But the two come together in this film in ways that make you go , " " Hmmmmm ... that 's so stupid ! " " and then have you laughing . For example , there is a scene back in " " 16th Century Japan " , " which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple . In the background of the temple , there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts . Hmmmm ... hahahah ! I could not stop laughing . And the acting goes from decent , to bearable , to oh my Lord , but that 's what makes it funny . You 'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible . I have to digress somewhat though because I have seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays and she is awesome . Her air time in the film was pretty short though . I have also seen Bryan Yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he 's also better in theatre than in this movie . Anyhow , it 's an entertaining film , if you 've got nothing to do on a weekday evening . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The first time I saw " " Alice in Wonderland 혯 an X-rated Musical Comedy " , " was in the early ' 80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends . I remember we actually enjoyed it very much , although we were left wondering why all the " " goodies " " were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one , leaving us guessing ... what we just missed . Obviously it was the soft-core edited ( chopped ) version , which left me with the desire to watch it again soon , but in its original integral version . Well , more then 20 years went by , during which I forgot all about this movie and , only a few days ago , by sheer chance , I stumbled upon a heavily used VHS copy ( which had seen better times : a bit washed-out colors , scratchy sound and a few flaws ) , but guess what ? It 's the original uncut version and , this time , I really had a ball ! Humor , Musical and Porn may sound an awkward combination but , in this case , it really works and , unlikely the big majority of boring porn-flicks nowadays invading our screens , this is a really amusing and entertaining sex fantasy , which will not disappoint you . The direction is clever , the swift editing makes the movie fly like a bird , all the familiar characters are lovable or just plain funny , all the actors seem having a good time , the songs are catchy ( worth mentioning the one about " " growing up " " sung by Alice at the beginning of the movie and the hilarious " " What 's a nice girl like you doing on a Knight like this " " ) , the dance numbers are well choreographed and staged ( amazingly energetic Terry Hall proves that she can " " also " " dance and dances enthusiastically her guts away ... Don 't worry , she also does what she was best known for ... ) , the acting , the singing , the set , the costumes are of quality level and then ... there is Kristine " " Blue Eyes " " DeBell , in the first starring role of her career and ( oh boy ! ) she indeed has a few H.C. sequences ! Personally I think they are absolutely not distasteful , on the contrary , they are spontaneous and quite arousing . She is young and ( ohhh ! ) so very pretty ; with the help of her new friends in Wonderland , she discovers her body and her sexuality so , she sings , she dances and ... what do you expect ? She is also experimenting sex ! The closing sequence , when she finally makes love to her boy-friend , is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie . I think her " " physique du role " " ( the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile ) and her acting ability , make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable . There is plenty of sex going on in ( this ) Wonderland and everybody seems eager to " " get busy " " with the first available boy ( s ) or girl ( s ) , which means lot of hard-core action to be seen . On the other hand , some close-up shots , clearly " " spliced in " , " just to make the " " porn-hounds " " really happy , are a bit redundant for my personal taste . In general , however , the sex-action is not offensive since handled with a great deal of humor and it blends almost seamlessly with the music , the dances and the comedy . If you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex , watch it together . Take my word , you will have an hour and a half of very good time ( perhaps also an after-show extra action ... ) This is " " Adult Entertainment " " so be careful , don 't leave this video around or among other kid 's videos . If your 10 years old can put his hands on it , he might amuse himself , but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations about the reasons why " " this " " Alice behaves quite differently from the one he red about in Lewis Carroll novel or he watched on the Disney 's video . I bet , you will not forget this " " one-of-a-kind " " very soon . It 's a real shame that they don 't mak 'em like that anymore ... ! I give it a 9 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
David Tennant and Sarah Parish 's brilliant acting had me in tears as many of the scenes were so familiar to me . My husband suffered a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage in 1977 and required a major operation which involved lifting his brain and plugging the leak . Like Tricia I was naive enough to expect that he would return to being his former self . After over 25 years of loving and caring for him he abandoned me without warning to go and live with a woman he hardly knew . He then petitioned for and I am now going through a divorce . I do hope the programme helped people to understand what it is like to cope with brain injury . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Life hits us in the face ........ we must try to stay beautiful " " Debut movie from one of Belgian 's best artists ( he sings songs ) , Tom Barman . A long awaited movie and---happy happy joy joy for Flemish filmmaking---really worth watching , and a promising piece of work ! It takes us into the lifes of 8 main characters that live through a Friday- and night . The title says a lot about the way we spend time with them : we float as they do into Friday night 's party where they kinda ' meet.It 's rhytmic style is very ' thought off ' . Superb use of music . It sometimes takes the upperhand to the images and then you feel its power . Gainsbourg ! QOTSA ! The party scene ( 20minutes ? ? ? ) is a thrilling visual experience cause of the way that it 's shot . It keeps you really with it while it 's set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party ..... so hard to shoot.Thank you menij챔r Barman for making this daring movie in these , already some years going , poor times of Flemish filmmaking . You made my day ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Could this be one of the earliest colour films ? It 's actually the second . This is a very beautiful piece of film produced by Thomas Edison . This was one of many of his other films.I think this is the most beautiful of any Thomas Edison films . It shows a girl dancing and moving her dress all around , which turns red with the film . It 's just beautiful.You are watching history when you watch this . You are watching what began to make movies of the day great ! This may not have a plot , or anything very interesting , but this is the second colour film ever.I recommend this to everyone , especially if you 're teaching students about filming or something of the sort , you have to show them what began color films ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" 1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition . The first was Chaffed Elbows ( 1966 ) . Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release . Pound ( 1970 ) and Greasers Palace ( 1972 ) were even more profane and obnoxious . Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince 's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope . And it is a mad farce / satire that has to be seen to be believed . I 'm not going to go through the plot here . What Plot ? ? People looking for a plot are going to be scratching their heads . Keep Scratching ! ! This film is not about PLOT ! One could compare this to a Mel Brooks movie ; only without the Hollywood parody party that Mel always threw . I also see a little bit of Monty Python in this . By the way : This film was shot before Monty had debuted on the BBC ! ! ! I notice that the Gags and Lines that are drop dead hilarious DO NOT transfer well by word of mouth . You have to see them within the context of the film . There are some flaws in the film ; but even the flaws are unique . For instance : Actors often repeat the SAME LINE over and over again ; and somehow it works . How Many Syllables Mario ? Putney Says the Borman Six Girl Has Got to Have Soul ! etc ... The B / W photography is outstanding . The Sound / Score is even better ! The editing is only so-so . The acting is above average . The script is priceless . The jokes are as un-PC as you can get : MR. Bad News says " " Sonny Williams just got caught in a motel with a 13 year old girl " " Putney says " " Well at least He 's not superstitious " " Uptight conservatives beware . The Anti-Establishment mindset of this film will drive you straight out of the room . Nothing is sacred.There are many things in this film that pertain to today : NO SMOKING ! ! ! Reverse Racism ; with African Americans treating Caucasions like trash . The manipulation of Mass Media over the masses ; Madison Avenue , Deroit , Hollywood intentionally pedaling something that any 8 year old can tell is pure garbage ; The Internet , I 'm talking about " " the drum " " ; Interracial dating ; I could go on and on .... I should also mention that there is about 8 min of this film that was shot in 16 mm Color . These are the commercials shot by Putney 's agency . The spots work fairly well the first time around . They get tiresome though on repeated viewings . The real magic here is within the B / W sections of the film . It 's the non-scenically lines they stay with you : " " Rent Yourself A CHORT Schmuck " . " " " I love You , I Love You , I love You ... did you take your pill ? " . " " " anything that I have to say would just be redundant " . " And a host of others . I also really like the bit with the mounted minnow up on the wall : " " The game warden wanted me to throw it back ... I put up such a fight , I decided to have it mounted ! " " Standouts in the cast include Buddy Buttler as Putney 's bodyguard # 1 . He should have been a much bigger star . Antonio Fargas as the Arab . He did go on to stardom on TV and in Films . Arnold Johnson has the right look as Putney Swoope . Robert Downey used his Own voice instead because Arnold couldn 't remember some of his lines . Also Downey realized that He could fill in any additional dialog / jokes later on if he dubbed his Lead actor . The film does have some shortcomings . The short run time is one . I wish the beginning with the White board members would have been extended . Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are outstanding . The ending seams to have been thrown together as if he just couldn 't think of any more gags . All in all , this is one of the Best low-budget independent films of it 's time . A time when very few indys ' played outside of New York , Chicago , San Francisco and L.A. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see this at least twice . Downey 's Putney Swoope is Ahead of and Beyond it 's time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film had a distinct Woody Allen feel about it , so if you 're not a fan of dry humor , dark humor , or back-handed humor , you probably could find something else to do . If you ARE , however , this is quirky , with some nice twists and a flowing , natural dialog.The story itself is quite engaging , not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot disengage your eyes , but close . I mean that in the best way possible . The intrigues are plenty , the twists are enough to fully engage the senses , and the characters are downright lovable.I had a great time with this movie.It rates an 8.3 / 10 from ... the Fiend : . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I don 't know what Dick steel was talking about , but I found this film to be one of Japan 's most thrilling epics to date . As for Armageddon or Deep Impact , or for that matter The day after tomorrow is pale in comparison . For what I know of films , most of the catastrophes in films are basically run of the mill asteroid flicks or one of which of Global Warming . This how ever ran a different course . A course of natural means where the earth 's crust is beginning to erode to such a degree , that it will take another piece of land with it for the ride . What the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the erosion from going to far and Sinking Japan altogether . In most cases this would simply be called tectonic shifting on steroids . I found the characters rather appealing in every way , from the child who lost her mother only to face her own demise among unfamiliar friends . Or the rescue girl who does all the she can to save lives in the face of disaster . Or a man who thought he could change her mind not to be such a dare devil and go with him to safety , only to become the hero himself and save his homeland . And let 's not forget , how the rest of the world just shucked them all back only to be forgotten , by having the world turning their backs on the Japanese citizens who cried for help . This was a great movie in all aspects . What Dick is trying to say is that this movie was not Hollywood made , that it was made in Japan , that it had characters which rival other actors around the world , that the effects are very gorgeous as he mentioned but it 's all he was waiting for , and nothing else . He lacks the vision of what 's important to everyone , and why this film had every element of feeling , of grandeur , and of humanity . I thought this film was top rate , and I have seen many disaster films to know that Japan Sinks was possibly one of the most original and well thought out projects I have witnessed . I really hope Shinji Higuchi will make another of such films . Oh and by the way , I am not Japanese , though in many ways I wish I was . I am Canadian , born and raised . And an avid movie buff in all aspects . Predjudicial visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion . Dick you should watch it with a more open heart and mind , don 't just look for the eye candy which makes a films content , look for what 's more important , and understand it . They may not be American , but the Japanese have cornered the market lately for some of the most breath taking and down right gritty film making to date . Which is why spending 25,000,000 is just what the Doctor ordered . You heard right , 25,000,000 to make this film . Now you tell me , was it worth it ? or was it worth it because American actors weren 't in it ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I love Kristen Dunst , especially in Elizabethtown . I guess she 's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera , but just be herself . She did that , and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown . In this movie , however , she did try to add in more artificial performance , especially in the first half of the film , so that she looked more like a sober editor . While in the other half , she totally set herself back in her daily track , and I just couldn 't tell her to be an editor any way . Therefore , her performance is not enduring in this film . The film , on the whole , is attracting and inspiring. the character of Young is full and reasonable . Anyway , the film tells a big and sophisticated story . The only big defect is that it didn 't show a turning point of the hero and heroine 's love story . I am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story , because that is rather unclear for the two persons . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I had seen The Cure when I was a kid and I loved it then . Now , years later , I got a hold of a copy almost by accident , and watched it again . Being a kid , you don 't really have the ability to procure things for yourself that you want , that is usually a prerogative of your parents - but when I watched it again now I felt sorry that I did not do more to get a copy of this movie back then , and consequently almost forgot about it until today.This really is a beautiful movie . It tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard-edged , misfit kid - who takes his cues from his horrible , abusive mother - and his neighbor , a slightly younger boy who has AIDS.Right , you say . Another one of " " those " . " A tear jerker . A bucket movie . A morality tail . Yeah , I know , I hate those too . Only this one isn 't . It is one of the very few movies among those many I have seen that pulls off a very rare trick : it conveys a truly sad story ( and yes , a morality tale ) but without a single moment where it feels cheesy , forced or in any other way " " hollywoody " . " It shows a REAL relationship between two REAL boys , who interact as REAL kids do . And through that interaction the good-natured , loving character of the older boy , Eric , starts to shine through his " " tough-guy " " persona , as he takes on a kind of big-brotherly care for Dexter , his HIV-positive younger neighbor . Together , they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which to Erik seems to be just around the corner - so that all this silly AIDS thing will go away and they can be friends forever.The production is top notch . But , of course , what really carries this movie , is the performances of the two leads - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello . Especially Mazzello , who is simply stunning - he does convey a sense of frailty needed for an ailing boy , but at the same time he manages to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined character . He shines at the scene where the boys confront Pony : his impulse to protect his older friend lunges him forth , drives him to say what he says - and only afterwards , the horror is depicted on his face , as he realizes that what he himself said is true : his blood is poison ... Renfro also has his moments , in particular the scenes with his mother : he depicts perfectly how this macho , street-wise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive , storming mother , and can 't get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance . Annabella Sciorra also gives a memorable performance as Dexter 's mother , who ultimately becomes , in a sense , a mother figure to Erik as well.I 've first seen this film when I was at school back in America , and loved it - not at all a given concerning movies of this sort . But the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real , I could easily relate to them . Ironically enough , the teacher who had shown us this movie ( a wonderful woman , I 'm still in touch with her ) got in trouble for it , as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a Playboy ... Pathetic . Seriously , will Americans ever get over this ridiculous phobia , I do not know . There was a hardly-distinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools ... how sad . Kids need to see this movie . It is more inspiring and educational than all the " " official " " after-school specials put together.Oh , and one more thing . I know I 'm rambling , but nevertheless ... The score . It 's great . I am a musician , and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records : he is a well known Jazz pianist and record producer . Up until this movie I really did not know that he did movie scores as well , even though when I later checked I found out that I had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on . Really , a wonderful job there.All in all , a solid Ten . I 'd recommend this movie to anyone . And I 'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings - they can use watching a film like this among all the standard special-effect hysteria they usually see . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ironically the most talked-about American film in the 2008 New York Film Festival is 98 % in Spanish . The extra-long film 's controversy began at the Cannes Festival . There were love-hate notices , and considerable doubts about commercial prospects . As consolation the star , Benicio Del Toro , got the Best Actor award there . I 'm talking about Steven Soderbergh 's ' Che , ' of course . That 's the name it 's going by in this version , shown in New York as at Cannes in two 2-hour-plus segments without opening title or end credits . ' Che ' is certainly appropriate since Ernesto " " Che " " Guevara is in almost every scene . Del Toro is impressive , hanging in reliably through thick and thin , from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two , appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations , even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into Bolivia . It 's a terrific performance ; one wishes it had a better setting.If you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours , with an intermission between the two sections , there are rewards . There 's an authentic feel throughout--fortunately Soderbergh made the decision to film in Spanish ( though some of the actors , oddly enough in the English segments especially , are wooden ) . You get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare , Che style , was like : the teaching , the recruitment of campesinos , the morality , the discipline , the hardship , and the fighting--as well as Che 's gradual morphing from company doctor to full-fledged military leader . Use of a new 9-pound 35 mm-quality RED " " digital high performance cine camera " " that just became available in time for filming enabled DP Peter Andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold , but at times still sing , and are always sharp and smooth.The film is in two parts--Soderbergh is calling them two " " films , " " and the plan is to release them commercially as such . First is ' The Argentine , ' depicting Che 's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of Havana in the late 50 's , and the second is ' Guerrilla , ' and concerns Che 's failed effort nearly a decade later in Bolivia to spearhead a revolution , a fruitful mission that led to Guevara 's capture and execution in 1967 . The second part was to have been the original film and was written first and , I think , shot first . Producer Laura Bickford says that part two is more of a thriller , while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes . Yes , but both parts have a lot in common--too much--since both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country . Guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the Bolivian revolt was doomed from the start . The group of Cubans who tried to lead it didn 't get a friendly reception from the Bolivian campesinos , who suspected foreigners , and thought of the Cuban communists as godless rapists . There is a third part , a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of Che 's speech at the United Nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time , but that is inter-cut in the first segment . The first part also has Fidel and is considerably more upbeat , leading as it does to the victory in Santa Clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba.During ' Guerilla ' I kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality European-style miniseries , which might begin with a shortened version of Walter Salles 's ' Motorcycle Diaries ' and go on to take us to Guevara 's fateful meeting with Fidel in Mexico and enlistment in the 26th of July Movement . There could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions . This is far from a complete picture of the man , his childhood interest in chess , his lifelong interest in poetry , the books he wrote ; even his international fame is only touched on . And what about his harsh , cruel side ? Really what Soderbergh is most interested in isn 't Che , but revolution , and guerrilla warfare . The lasting impression that the 4 + hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich . Someone mentioned being reminded of Terrence Malick 's ' The Tin Red Line , ' and yes , the meandering , episodic battle approach is similar ; but ' The Thin Red Line ' has stronger characters ( hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides Che ) , and it 's a really good film . This is an impressive , but unfinished and ill-fated , effort.This 8-years-gestating , heavily researched labor of love ( how many more Ocean 's must come to pay for it ? ) is a vanity project , too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries . Radical editing--or major expansion--would have made it into something more successful , and as it is it 's a long slog , especially in the second half.It 's clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down , though it 's not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken--but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Look , although we don 't like to admit it , we 've all have to suppress our fears concerning the extreme likelihood of experiencing the events that take place in this movie .

" A dark and painful look at the perils of drug addiction , Sinatra is wonderful in this film . Just watching his frenzied writhing and screaming and destructive rage near the end of the film is enough to make anyone think twice about trying heroin ; maybe they should show this to kids in health class instead of the mindless drivel we are compelled to endure year after year.It 's the story of a man who is simply trying to make a new , clean life for himself after being in prison , trying to rid himself of his drug habit and his job of dealing cards in illegal gambling operations , who is pulled down , pulled back into the muck by the evils of human nature . He is being taken advantage of by his employers , the drug dealers , and even his enigmatic , crafty-yet-stupid wife . Even if you didn 't like the film itself , it 's worth seeing just for the soundtrack . It 's all heavy , swinging jazz with large drum and brass sections . This , with its groovy , yet slightly sinister sound , helps set the mood , along with the grinning , snaky drug and card dealers , who always seem to hover like vultures around Frankie Machine.I recommend this to anyone -- especially if you like film noir , zoot suits , fedoras , or jazz . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war , this film isn 't too sticky and pink , because love is as a rose : With thorns , that is . The four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down-to-earth . The music and lyrics of the cabaret / chanson-esquire songs ( sung b Keira Knightley herself ) drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film , from one place to another , between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love . Some people may find it too much a biopic , but it 챠s mostly a romantic story , even though it consequently follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy . London gets visualized from another angle for once , the bohemian life of Dylan during the bombings of the Germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms , pubs and bars . The independent women , the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger .

" The Man in the White Suit is one of those delightful comedies that Ealing studies made so well in the 40 's and 50 's . The plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks . Of course , this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles . However , things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people , including cloth manufacturers , the cloth mill 's workforces , and even an old lady that does her washing every week . The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific advances , and the way that they don 't always help ; as the old woman says at one point in the movie , " " Why cant you scientists just leave things alone ? " " Like a lot Ealing comedies , this one stars Sir Alec Guinness . Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor ; he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence ( and he does in this film , literally ) , but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way . He is suitably creepy in this film , and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character ; an intelligent and ambitious , but slightly naive scientist . Along with Guinness , The Man in the White Suit also features Joan Greenwood , the deep voiced actress that co-starred with Guinness in the simply divine " " Kind Hearts and Coronets " " and Michael Gough , a man that would go on to get himself the role of Alfred in the Batman films . The acting in the film isn 't always great , but it is always decent , and it 's fits with the film.The Man in the White Suit is an intelligent , thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral . The comedy isn 't always obvious , and it doesn 't always work , but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs , so that is forgivable . I recommend this movie , basically , to anyone that is a fan of movies . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
I 'm not a movie maker but I do know it is hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw your audience into the character . Horses on Mars does this and more . When you are watching a good movie you don 't want it to end . This is how I felt watching this film . It is visually expansive and the microbe takes on such human qualities that you feel you are on the journey with him.Really looking forward to see what exciting adventures Mr. Anderson takes us on in the future .

" As a young teen when this came out , I completely related to it . As an adult in the present sex- obsessed American culture , it doesn 't have enough nudity to be called tame . If you are looking for American Pie-type lewdness , vulgarity or fart and feces jokes , Meatballs will disappoint with impunity and a guarantee . If you like Bill Murray , and you like good clean fun , you will probably like and enjoy this film very much . Similarly with Stripes , Ghostbusters , Caddy Shack , etc . Enough said , just go watch it , and stop intellectualizing it . It 's Meatballs , for crying out loud ! Why read a review ? Just enjoy it and have fun . And ignore the trash talk by others .

" A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict . The movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being ( or being around ) a heroin addict really is . Good movie , which will never truly be outdated . Excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is Preminger 's way of showing how bleak a JUNKIE 'S world can become .

They comment on things that the average movie goer doesn 't even know or think about.I enjoyed the film . It was what I was expecting therefore was not disappointed . Steven gets a bad rap for putting his views into his films but that 's also a reason to watch . What 's even more funny is the people that complain about his films , say he 's the worst and that we shouldn 't watch his films , yet watch his movies anyway . All so they can comment on how bad they are . Who 's the dummy ? If you don 't like his work , don 't watch it .

" Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like . It is a fooler . Through Fonda 's performance we are led to believe ( on the surface ) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin . But , through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings , you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him . In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor . It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years . When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect . There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard . He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.The ending by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War . He goes forward into history . The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is tremendous . Definitely worth seeing again . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I don 't agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the American International Pictures . Basil Deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war England ( but without the sentimentality of " " Blackboard Jungle " " ) . The cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate . The estate looked like an old prison . Stanley Baker was excellent as the hardened detective , reassigned to the juvenile division - " " Urgent , urgent - Larceny - five iced lollies " " ! ! ! ! He finds he is the butt of many jokes . David McCallum showed that he was one of Britain 's top young talents of the fifties . ( He had a very different role in another Stanley Baker film " " Hell Drivers " " ) . His portrayal of Johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening . Ann Heywood was also very good as the cynical Cathie . I wouldn 't say there was a romantic subplot in it.Detective Jack Truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the " " Firefly " . " Just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough , he is assigned to the Juvenile Division - he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work . Amid all the heckling he gets his first call out - the 6 year old Murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops ! ! ! Taking the twins home he meets their brother , the charismatic Johnny , and their embittered sister Cathie . He starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals . As he gets more involved with the family , he realises there is a strong link between the fires , Johnny and a frightened Chinese youth who works for a laundry . The local priest ( Peter Cushing in an unusual role , away from the Hammer horrors ) explains that when Johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero . He wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires . The school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children 's fear - the teacher ( thinking only of her own safety ) runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman ! ! ! ! I thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems Britain experienced after the war.Highly Recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is the Australian TV series . It is a classic . The stories and actors are excellent . Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet being ambushed ? This is cult TV .

The closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel , then Keir sleeping n being jostled around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that .

" I saw this on TCM recently and , through the IMDb I found that there were seven " " Crime Doctor " " movies with Warner Baxter as the psychiatrist-detective . Baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd Street a decade earlier . Not noir , and a bit campy today , the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural . The plot , black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan series . There are subplots , unexpected twists and appearances by a number of B movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately ( none ever made it to the A status ) .

" " " Meatballs " " is an ode to summer camp . Those of us who got to go to camp will see many of the scenes as we remember or wish they could have been.Bill Murray plays senior boys counselor Tripper Harrison , who really runs the camp . He reminds us of the funny cool staff member who everyone loves . Young campers gravitate toward him and if he speaks to you , you feel like you are family . This is one of Murray 's best roles . He drives the film with his one liners and ad-libs.Chris Makepeace plays Rudy , the loner camper who is taken under Tripper 's wing and breaks out of his shell.The rest of the campers and staff in the film were excellent as well.The overall theme of the movie is the underdog overcoming obstacles to finally win . From Rudy to Spaz to the Camp and even to Tripper himself , the underdogs of the film are the stars . The movie has heart.The film is fun and funny without being cruel or oversexed as some teen movies are today . The cast look and act like real people.The comedy and heart draw you in to the point that at the end , just like at camp , you are sad to leave.In my summer camp experience we had underwear run up flag poles , mystery meat , trying to sneak a peek into the girls cabin , the lunatic-with-the hook stories around the camp fire , and moving sleeping people out of their cabins and putting them elsewhere . But we also had a dedicated camp staff guiding us to be the best we could be.My favorite scene is the CIT overnight when they are canoeing across the lake singing a goofy song . The one line that cracks me up every time is when Tripper is announcing light outs the evening before Parent 's Day and he ends " " Tomorrow is parents day , and you must look rested or Morty will be sent to the state penitentiary .

" first real movie in this year. amazing long shots , sometimes with fix camera , so specific for Nordic cinema ( let aside Dogma ) . A true auteur film I find it .

That 's the point I don 't think it stands up in the whole plot . Why , if this was an ideal world , couldn 't you die but still you were keeping your conscience ? Either was the real world with " " tailored " " rules or was a " " fantastic " " world but in this case no accidents like people remembering how it was before can happen.It reminded me of Kafka and maybe more , of Huxley 's Brave New World , especially in that part where sex was actually available to everyone , since it was viewed like a right to pleasure . It lacked a plot but I think it was better like this , since you realized and sensed the whole strange behavior of everyone , the absurdity and the lack of real sensations in this " " happy " " world.I think also that the end was brilliant. true world is indeed a homo homini lupus , you 're eaten if you are not strong enough . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" As an ancient movie fan , I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others . I decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film . I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch . The beginning quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me ... why to entail a sentence from the Gospel by Mark in the movie about pagan Rome ? But the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple ( Caligula and Drusilla ) running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental . The music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense . Yet , the negative feelings raised in me quite soon , particularly at the death of Tiberius . The cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated . However , it was not that horrific to the middle . During the second half of the film , I felt as if I watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn . In the end , I said to myself " " This is one of the movies that one may really hate " " ... I am aware that a movie may be controversial but I had never expected that CALIGULA would go that far in removing all limits of taste . I hate this film due to many reasons , but particularly one.CALIGULA does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic ( which it claims to be ) , but Bob Guccione , the director and the founder of Penthouse pornographic magazine , aims at combining film art with porn . That is , I think , the most serious matter the film may be accused of . Movie is an art that should be reigned by taste , by message , by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste . CALIGULA shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked , decadent manner . Some scenes are so disgusting that I don 't think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them . Some say that the Rome under Caligula 's reign was so brutal . Yes , it is true . Corruption bloomed at that time , various sexual deviances were preferable to Roman citizens . Yet , I do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic . I believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies ... HUGE HISTORICAL MISTAKES : The screenplay by Gore Vidal is notorious for inaccuracies . It is noticeable , for instance , with the figure of Proculus ( Donato Placido ) , a historic Roman senator . Yet , the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom Caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes . Moreover , Livia was not Proculus wife raped by Caesar on her wedding . What lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence ? Another example of historical travesty is the figure of Caesonia portrayed by Helen Mirren . She is presented as Caligula 's wife together with Drusilla , his sister . In fact , Caligula married Caesonia long after the death of his sister . The sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases . I also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts . TECHNICAL ASPECT AND CAST : From the technical point of view , the film is nothing special . The cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding . Yet , the only strong point of the movie are the performances , particularly the one by Malcolm McDowall as Caligula . He does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor . McDowall raises the value of the film . If everything bothers you in CALIGULA , you may at least admire his performance . I also fancied Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla ( yet the film is based on a gossip by Suetonius that Caligula made love to his sister ) . Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O 'Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable . O 'Toole does his finest piece of acting in the Capri Grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor . Yes , I admit that THE ONLY THING I like about CALIGULA are the performances . Therefore , I don 't rate the movie 1 / 10.LAME CONTINUITY : The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity . Let us analyze just the beginning : Caligula comes to Capri Grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old Tiberius . Then , after about 15 minutes , the action moves to Rome where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula 's bed constitutes a bad omen . And immediately the characters are again in Capri where Nerva ( John Gielgud ) is dying ... ? All in all , I don 't recommend to see CALIGULA to anyone . If you want to know the story , read Robert Graves ' gorgeous novel I , CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or watch Herbert Wise 's mini series with the magnificent performance by Derek Jacobi . CALIGULA is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art . It is , in its most part , a porn movie that should never be called an epic.There are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen people 's taste of beauty , there are movies that are average entertainment ; yet they have something to offer , there are movies that show extreme violence ; yet they still convey some moral , there are , however , movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm people 's minds , CALIGULA unfortunately belongs to the latest group , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I swore I would never allow myself to devolve into to the bogus authority figures of the sixties who told me things were better in the " " good old days " " 혯 the current Australian Prime Minister is a sordid example of just such a mind set.But I switched over to " " A Decade Under the Influence " " because I found watching the much-heralded " " Sneakers " " documentary on the other channel such a dispiriting experience . I found the values expressed by the " " Sneakers " " interviewees too ugly to accept as reasonable . So materialistic ! So devoid of any sense of outrage at a society that can countenance killing someone to steal his very ugly shoes ! So lacking in any worthwhile purpose that they can report without distaste the exploitation an audience by haranguing them to hold those shoes above their heads to lock in a sponsorship deal for themselves with a company of cobblers was just too much to continue watching . " " A Decade Under the Influence " " depicted a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity , corruption and concupiscence in high ( and low ) places.I have noted the change in film-making that accompanied the exposure of America 's disastrous foreign policy debacles in Vietnam and so many less reported places in my www.peterhenderson.com.au website . " " A Decade Under the Influence " " documents the precise moment at which that change took place.Before the seventies , the armed forces were depicted in American films as an invincible fighting force comprised of decent human beings who transmogrified into conquering heroes on the battlefield . After the seventies they are generally portrayed as a dispirited rabble misled by a bunch of bureaucrat clowns in the Pentagon Before the seventies , the FBI agent and the honest cop tended to be depicted as your friend and protector . After the seventies , the FBI agents were all incompetent and the best a cop could aspire to was to ignore their foolishness and his superior 's corruption and uphold justice in his own idiosyncratic manner.Before the seventies , the archetypical American " " little guy " , " the " " average Joe " , " the Jimmy Stewart type would face down the problems encountered and thereby gain some insight into underlying wisdom of his elected leaders and justice of the " " American Way " . " After the seventies , Kevin Costner usurps that role , but now he is the voice of one crying out in the wilderness for evil to be exposed , or accepting his lot and making out the best he can.And now those " " old time religion " " mindsets have been stripped of any honesty and righteousness and portrayed ( with a certain amount of justification ) as sanctimonious bigotry and self-serving hypocrisy . " " A Decade Under the Influence " " tells it like it was . " " A Decade Under the Influence " " tells it like it is now . It depicts the redemption of the American film industry from the hands of the artistically , morally and intellectually bankrupt studio moguls . It shows the storming of the Hollywood Bastille by the independent film makers who promised to get a disillusioned and tired audience back into the cinemas . The fact that their failures were numerous , and at times disastrous , merely underlines the greatness of their achievement . An achievement reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitudes of the big box office stars such as Clooney , Daman , Affleck etc and the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Just came out of a sneak preview for this film . It had me laughing every 30 secs . The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I hadn 't bought that large coke . There are definitely some lulls , but , overall , highly entertaining . The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in " " Bruce Almighty " " and Will Ferrell " " Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgendy " " in their movies . Paul Rudd is hilarious as always . I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas ( like P.S. ) . I think that Seth Rogen should be getting more work , because he so freaking talented and engaging . Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments . I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac . However , if you 're easily offended , don 't see this movie . If you 're a rabid feminist , don 't see this movie .

" " " Blind Spot " " one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways . The cast is great . James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles . His journal entries , which we hear in voice-over-narration , work well with the visuals and are quite intense . The film has a powerful style . It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions . It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love . There is a dreamlike quality to several sequences and the images are saturated with an eerie sense of tension . Strange . Suspenseful . Beautiful to look at . Definitely worth seeing . I really would like to see it again . Periodically I check to see if Blind Spot has been distributed . I can 't wait to see the film again in the cinema or on DVD.Davide Pepe 13 / 08 / 2005 Bologna - Italy , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was fortunate enough to see The Last Stop here where I live at the Moving Pictures Film Festival ( for those of you that don 't know , the Moving Pictures Film Festival is a tour of Canadian made film in Canada ) . I was told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was on the verge of getting an American distribution deal which added to my excitement.I 'm a big horror movie fan , and yes , I love the Scream trilogy as well . So when I found out that Rose McGowan was doing a Ten Little Indians type of movie I knew that I was in for a treat . Rose McGowan was the biggest name actor / actress at the entire festival.The best way I can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that it 's not quite like Scream . And it certainly is worth seeing . It 's set in the middle of a snowstorm ( it was filmed in Vancouver , B.C. , Canada ) at a mountaintop motel , which adds to the suspense . Rose McGowan puts in a great performance as the-girl-next-door ( ? ! ) along with the rest of the cast . And as for what happens at the end , well , the only thing I 'll say is that you 'll never guess the ending.Sadly , it probably won 't make it into mainstream North American theatres because the only decent money maker in it is Rose McGowan . But if you get the chance to see it I would recommend you do . And if worse comes to worst , there 's always video.I gave it a 9 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For a long time it seemed like all the good Canadian actors had headed south of the border and ( I guessed ) all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex comedies.This film was a real surprise : despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces , the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we , the viewer , got back was almost true suspension of belief .

House of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part . A psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game.Have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong ? Watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way . Sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators . You 're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie.This is both a quality and a drawback of the script . As the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency . But all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development.This is definitely one of the best movies about gambling . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yes , I 'm sentimental & schmaltzy ! ! But this movie ( and it 's theme song ) remain one of my all time greats ! !

" This movie is not great , but it is a good and enjoyable one . It feels like an indie film made out of a play script . Morgan Freeman basically plays himself , although the director swears the script was not written for him . And there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasn 't committed to yet . I mean , he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it : ) I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste , but refreshing nonetheless . This is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go . A bit too much emphasis on appearance , if you ask me.Bottom line : a nice little film , made in two weeks , with basically two actors and a few extras , dialogue driven , makes Morgan Freeman look good : ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Considering all the teen films like " " the Breakfast Club " " and " " Pretty In Pink " " that are lionized . It is surprising that this one is so ignored.There is no sex in it , but sex is thought of , including the idea that it may matter what others think about it . The kids do not always get along with their parents , but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong , and the parents are not seen as monsters.It deals with hero-worship . How one girl does a dangerous thing , which could have lead to real dustier , before realizing that she was wrong.The movie is kind of ahead of its ' time .

" Every time the supposed explorers and we , the audience , is primed to set its first sights one of the wonderous new worlds , for some ungodly reason , the filmmakers decided to distract with an " " emergency " " or some false alarm or some bit of artificial dramatic suspense . So instead of calmly enjoying the surface of Io , or standing over the rings of Saturn or concentrating on the magic of flying by a comet or an asteroid , we are distracted into worrying about the wellbeing and survival of the characters . Big let down ! ! ! ! The filmmakers seem to be unsure what they want . A documentary of the natural wonders in our solar system , or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than the subject matter . Come on . Hello . If I wanted suspense and tension I 'd watch a real Narrative sci-fi movie . Sure it 's a docu-drama . But the characters and their survival here ( the risks of such a mission - should be secondary to the subject matter ) . Wait . Yes the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject matter - since essentially this is a film about a space mission , not just about the solar system . But it was overplayed and distracted strongly from the discovery of new worlds we were supposed to be enjoying . Otherwise , the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feel for the human elements of a space mission , the squabbles , the tensions , the weight of responsibility , the near-fatal mistakes , the sacrifices , etc . Also it would fit very well in the hard-sci-fi subgenre - in fact it would be one of the best , because here the science was almost closely adhered to . But the distractions were awful . Otherwise , I missed showing the effects of being in space for several years on the astronauts AFTER landing on Earth . Also not , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Neatly skipping over everything from the coup in Cuba to his undercover entry into Bolivia , part two of Soderbergh 's portrayal of Che Guevara is that of the tragic hero . As with Che 혯 Part One , this rather rambling guerrilla warfare escapade through the colourful mountains of Bolivia is probably destined to disappoint more people than it will satisfy , so why was the film ( and particularly Benicio Del Toro 's performance ) so loudly praised at Cannes ? James Rocchi , for instance , called it , a work of art that 's , " " not just the story of a revolutionary , " " but , " " a revolution in and of itself . " " The Guardian 's Peter Bradshaw called it a " " flawed masterpiece . " " I return to my original contention for Part One 혯 that the value lies particularly in depiction of a hero figure . And in an age when there is a surfeit of poor hero role-models , could it not be salutary to see a strongly honourable one , even if stripped of some of the less endearing episodes of his life ? This is the psychological hero enshrined by the great Scottish essayist , Thomas Carlyle , in his seminal book , Heroes and Hero Worship . Heroes can be real or imaginary ( or somewhere in-between ) . But should genuinely inspire us to higher goals , a higher purpose . Compare this with the unrealistic ' heroes ' of standard Western storytelling : where a person undergoes trials and tribulations before obtaining a barely-believable reward 혯 usually everlasting love or material wealth 혯 as if by divine studio intervention . Real heroes have an excess of moral courage 혯 not Lost Ark dare-devilishness or James Bond super-toys . They rise , and empower others to rise , to be the best that they can be . In Part One , Che succeeds . In Part Two , he fails . It is not for want of moral courage but since a ) not all good plans can succeed and b ) being human , mistakes are inevitable.Guevara 's intellectual clarity is flawed when he equates conditions that justify armed struggle with conditions that make that armed struggle able to succeed . It is a serious miscalculation.High in the mountains from La Paz , the colours are breathtaking . There is an air of mise-en-scene authenticity that was occasionally lacking in Che - Part One ( The U.S. would not allow Soderbergh to film in Cuba . ) Visual treats are heightened by maximising natural light and the extreme flexibility and realism offered with groundbreaking RED cameras . This is a high performance digital cine camera with the quality of 35mm film and the convenience of pure digital . Designed for flexibility and functionality , the package weighs a mere 9 lbs . " " Shooting with RED is like hearing the Beatles for the first time , " " says Soderbergh . " " RED sees the way I see . . . so organic , so beautifully attuned to that most natural of phenomena 혯 light . " " If Che had stopped with the successful Cuban revolution it would have enshrouded him with an almost mystical invincibility . That he fails in Bolivia shows not only that he has human limitations but that it is his moral virtues that are remembered , not the political triumph . Critics will say 혯 and with some justification - that his armed struggle inspired much less noble characters to achieve tin-pot dictatorships . His development of guerrilla fighting tactics are not good or bad in themselves ( and have since been used for both ) .But for all its praiseworthiness , the film often seems to lack dramatic and narrative tension . We stumble from one escapade to another , knowing that he will eventually meet his death . I found myself glancing at my watch and thinking it could have been shorter . But the work that has gone into this 혯 interviews with people from all sides and even getting one of Guevara 's ex-comrades to coach actors on the minutiae of the Bolivian operations 혯 make the film a commendable achievement . It might not be top-flight entertainment , but it demonstrates integrity in documenting a significant slice of history.There is also another very important point in the Che ' hero ' figure here . It 's about failure . That if you try your utmost , even if you fail , your effort will not have been in vain because it may give others hope and moral courage . One could cynically call it a ' martyr ' complex , and it is found , of course , in many religious figures as well . But Che does not ' sacrifice ' himself . He does what he does best , to the best of his not inconsiderate ability , and so provides an example . Success or failure in any particular instance become mere details.With the U.S. ' s longstanding and illegal blockade of Cuba ( all in the name of ' freedom ' ) , I am tempted to write that Che Parts 1 & 2 are too good to be wasted on the U.S. But that would be to invite a contention that the film has sought so earnestly to avoid . One must hope that many viewers will have the skill to view Che without politics and the bias that inevitably engenders . Whatever its faults , it rehabilitates Soderbergh from the populist nonsense of Oceans 11.But if you haven 't heard of Che Guevara or seen Part One , or if you can 't get past the phrase ' murderous Marxist ' without frothing at the mouth , I might struggle to imagine what you would get from this film . The same can be said for many who have , and can . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Yet i still love this movie and everything about it even if it is kind of " " kiddy " " this is one of the few movies me and my freinds have been able to keep watching over the years and quote whenever possible . GREAT MOVIE . This movie should the AFIs number 1 because its so friggin ' high class .

" In 2004 , I wrote the following statements on an IMDb message board when a user wondered if The Best Years of Our Lives was a forgotten movie : * * * * * To me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule . I think in many ways " " The Best Years of Our Lives " " is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the US in the mid-1940s after WWII . I believe " " Coming Home " " and " " The Deer Hunter " , " both released in 1978 , were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in " " The Best Years of Our Lives " . " What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie.This movie still packs a wallop and I 'm very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time . * * * * * I 'm very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI . Also , though it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic , It 's a Wonderful Life , arguably , The Best Years of Our Lives ' Oscar wins , including Best Picture , were very well-deserved . I 've just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years , The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful , beautifully acted and well-crafted motion picture . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " Well , i got these episodes of Farscape " . " I said : " " Ok , let me try it " " I was pretty sure at that time that i wont like it because i was just finised watching TNG and found it great . " " I had 3 episodes , viewed those but the show didn 't impressed me very much , i found it childish initially and i thought its just another TV show , nice adventures but regular . Music was a little bit different , neat special effects though and i had the vague impression that the actors didn 't fully get into the characters skin.I watched another 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide i like or not since . Then the show started to get me , i got a good grasp of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor Crichton .... the rest is history . I think i mostly like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action unlike Star Trek where everybody slept when they were supposed to do and way too much high tech bullshit . The show got better with each episode , very interesting story line ..... what can i say , this movie its like poetry . I highly recommend it ! ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I believe anyone who enjoyed Eisentein 's Ivan the Terrible movies would enjoy this well crafted movie . This movie played out like " " Lord of the Ring : Return of the King " , " but without the special effect but as good and better drama.We have the German , who dressed like KKK , conquered Novgorod of Russia . The Russian summoned Nevsky to lead them to fight the German to save Russia . Nikolai Cherkasov , who played Ivan in the Ivan the Terrible films , was charismatic as Nevsky . The first 10 min how he handled the passing by Mongol was captivating.Many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white . The anticipation of War did not require any dialogue such as " " how many enemy we will be killing " , " etc . Except for a few speeches , the film can basically be played out as a silent film . The fighting scene can hold up to those of the Civil War fighting scene of The Birth of a Nation.Another strength of the movie is the great musical score , by Sergei Prokofiev . The music gave an epic feel to the movie in those scenes without dialogue . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I saw LAUREN BACALL do CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway , I never dreamed that one day I would see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN playing the Bacall role on screen . But here Ingrid really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretending to be WALTER MATTHAU 's wife so he can go on with the fib he 's told GOLDIE HAWN.It 's a story played for laughs from beginning to end , good-humored stuff that never runs out of dry humor and wit throughout its running time . There are plenty of one-liners or gags that are way above the usual situation comedy stuff one hears on TV--the lines ring true because they blend so well with the characters and their motives.As the daffy girl who contemplates ( in the beginning ) committing suicide over her unhappy affair with Matthau , GOLDIE HAWN ( fresh from her days as a star on TV 's " " Laugh In " " ) does a dumb blonde role to perfection . Easy to see why she won that Supporting Actress Oscar.Ingrid is surprisingly fetching in a rare comedy role , although there are times when she seems just a bit too matronly for the part . At any rate , she 's a surprising choice to play the nurse who puts on a freeze act at the office but is considerably warmer off duty.As Goldie 's next door neighbor , Igor , Rick Lenz acquits himself admirably , and makes a suitable match for her in that final scene.Matthau plays the kind of character that became his stock in trade in all those Neil Simon roles he had--a lovable cad who gets caught up in his own messes when he tells lie after lie.It 's the kind of rib-tickling comedy that 'll have you laughing out loud at some of the amusing lines that Abe Burrows and I.A.L. Diamond have managed to scrap together , based on a French farce . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What if Marylin Monroe , Albert Einstein , Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy were to come together in a mind-bending evening of relativity ? This delightful roman 횪 clef never uses the actual names of the characters it so thinly veils and scathingly exposes not only for the individuals they must have been , but also for what they came to represent over time . If you are confused by allegory , or if you like your movies served up predigested and mushy , you won 't like this film . It is a demanding opus that rewards on many levels the viewer with the intelligence to appreciate it . Dropping , for the time being , the rigorous avoidance of using the real names of the characters , we see Einstein , about to deliver a pacifist speech to a United Nations hell-bent for nukes , being visited by Marylin Monroe , after filming the notorious Seven Year Itch scene that some say led to the end of her marriage with Joe Dimaggio . They have a lovely interplay in which Einstein stumbles with suitable professorial clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sex symbol of modern times . Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is a Red . He is determined to extract Einstein 's assurance that he will support the activities of the House Unamerican Activities Committee while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace . Add Joe , a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person perhaps not perfectly cast as Gary Busey , who hates Marylin 's exhibitionism and believes Einstein has become her lover , even though Marylin only wants to show Einstein that she understands the Special Theory of Relativity . But there 's more . Just like each of us , these characters have their deepest fears , which they reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks . It is these weaknesses , ultimately , that lend humanity to figures we cannot help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today . Finally , we see the shocking terror of Einstein 's vision , and the statement of the movie becomes clear . It is a powerful and memorable moment.Insignificance is one of my top five movies of all time . It is utterly amazing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's a little disconcerting to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young . But this film is where Gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name.I 'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that I really enjoyed this film , mainly because of the vibrant performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona . She was funny , angry , vulnerable , caring , and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the Lusitania , and whose father was later killed during Woar War I. As the " " man " " of the house , Fiona has stood steadfast for years against settling her father 's will which would therefore allow a Donald Trump type named Charles Barclay to get the family home . But Fiona 's keeping a secret as to why she hates Barclay so much .

" This interesting lost film ( written by Terence Malick ) stars Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest as two wacky , Southern brothers on a quest to open a seafood restaurant . Margot Kidder was never prettier and Forrest should have been nominated . Originally titled The Dion Brothers , this light-hearted flick with a violent ending is a pure joy ! Where is this film ? I 've been searching for it for 30 years . Keach was still great back then and I 'm surprised it doesn 't have more of a cult following ( maybe it does ) .

" Kenneth Branagh 's " " Hamlet " " hits all the marks . The acting is magnificent , the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous , the Oscar-nominated costumes and sets are stunning , and Patrick Doyle 's score ( also Oscar-nominated ) is sensitive and moving . Oh yeah - the screenplay , by some guy named Will S. , isn 't too bad either . Film critics ribbed Branagh for receiving the films ' fourth Oscar nod for " " adapting " " the screenplay , but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one . I can 't think of many better ways to make four hours fly by.Nearly every decision Branagh makes works brilliantly : the use of England 's Blenheim Palace for exteriors , the Edwardian dress , and the staging of " " To be or not to be " " in a hall of mirrors , to name a few . The casting of Hollywood luminaries such as Robin Williams , Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor parts can be distracting , but that 's nitpicking . The principal cast excels : Derek Jacobi captures the conflicted nature of Claudius ; Kate Winslet acutely depicts Ophelia 's descent into madness ; Julie Christie brings passion to her portrayal of Gertrude ; Richard Briers is pitch-perfect as the conniving Polonius ; and Nicholas Farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of Horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship . Every speech , every line , every word is delivered with passion and conviction ; there isn 't a wasted moment in the entire film . The final scenes magnify the extent of Shakespeare 's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations.Branagh 's " " Hamlet " " is a bold , ambitious , and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare 's language with equally eloquent imagery . It 's arguably the greatest Shakespearean adaptation ever filmed 혯 strong praise , but well deserved . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" After reading the book , I happened across this DVD at Wal-Mart for 3 bucks and thought , sure , what the hell ... I got the DVD and watched it last night . When I started watching it , I checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes . I thought , OK cool ... It seemed to run rather slowly , knowing the story and how much of it there was . By the time I got to the actual killings , I was like , " " how much time does this have left ? " " Checked . " " One minute ? ! What the hell ? ! " " I felt incredibly cheated , thinking that the movie only progressed through a third of the overall story.But then , I happily noticed that the DVD 's scene selection menu included a part 1 AND a part 2 . I still had another hour and a half to go ! I then sat very happily and enjoyed the second half of the movie , even more so than the first.I admit that I have not seen the 1967 original film ( despite my sincerest desire to ) , I have however read the novel and felt that this was a fairly descent film , for a two-part TV miniseries , that is . I think the casting of the role of Perry was completely wrong and a few minor inconsistencies jumped out at me , but still very well done . The first half drags on a bit , while the second half is much more gripping . I think they should have proportioned the movie more like Capote did his book : 1 / 3 before the murders , 1 / 3 after , and 1 / 3 after the killers are arrested . Instead , the film makes it more 1 / 2 before the murders , 1 / 4 after , and 1 / 4 after the killers are arrested . Again , this makes the second half more exciting , but at the same time , less compelling while making the first half drag on and on ... Now I look back and realize I have just made the same mistake about making things drag on and on , so I will shut the hell up . Go watch the movie and make up your own damn mind !

Some great comical lines - actually laugh out loud , amazing action and a great plot . Choice of music and ambiance all fantastic , basically brilliantly directed and brilliants written .

" I bought this film from my local blockbuster for 99p an it 's been sitting in my video bookcase for at least a year now . Then tonight I decided to see it , the film was quite different to what I had expected and I didn 't find any humour in it all I saw was that it was a bleak look at people dealing with love relationships and sexual orientation and I didn 't really see the psycho killer plot really having a point except to add tension to the end of the film . I felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job . I was following her emotions and what happened around her . Some people would probably have seen some of the stuff that she does as funny but I could really put myself in her place , loving someone but them rejecting you at every turn no matter how hard you try . I thought it was a very moving film and dealt with all the different sexualities well . I was expecting something like Bound & Gagged : A love story , but this is a very different film .

" This , ladies and gentlemen , is truly a modern B-movie . The dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity , the premise is predictable ( there are a few decent twists ) and characters remain 2D for most of it . And yet there is a certain ... charm . WWE wrestler Kane brings to life the sick , twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos ( though it is somewhat like his character that he 's been playing around ten years ) and so I 'll find it quite amusing when people say it 's " " not much of a reach for him , " " but Glen Jacobs is , apparently , quite the nice guy , so actually it is . In any event , he 's cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top ( Jason would be proud ) , but I heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes . Frankly go into this movie thinking that you 'll have some fun and a gorefest , oh it is QUITE the gorefest . The R-rating IS richly deserved and I actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times .

" Tim Robbins did a masterful job directing this film . I say this because he avoided convention and clich챕 . He also oversaw superb performances from Susan Sarandon ( who won an Oscar for her role ) and Sean Penn . Even more amazing , Robbins doesn 't patronize . He just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer 's mind .

" How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad , scary and life-affirming . It ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen , even though you were hoping--maybe even beleiving--it wouldn 't . Utlimately , this is the film 's greatest strength : it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations , then drops a bomb on you . I saw this in a film theory class at USC back in the mid- ' 90s . It is not easy to find , but is definitely worth hunting for . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched this movie recently and fell in love with it . I loved the storyline and the actors . It has a little of everything . I was completely taken by the unfolding of the story . It has so many surprises along the way . I highly recommend it . In fact , I loved it so much that I ran out and bought the book . I felt I had to read it in order to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie . I also wanted to make sure I didn 't miss anything that was in the book but kept out of the movie . I recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is enough difference in the book , especially in the second episode , to want to read it . It has become my favorite movie . I am now a Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy fan ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I love this movie ! It has everything ! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing , directing and co-starring in this film . David Duchovny is just plain hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with David Allen Grier , Carol O 'Connor , Robert Loggia , Joley Richardson , and Jim Belushi you have a Oscar worthy movie ! I 'm surprised they didn 't get one. if you haven 't seen it , go rent the DVD , watch it once then put directors commentary on ... Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have watched this film several times over the years and always find it an entertaining experience . As a retired airline pilot , I am interested in most aviation movies and this is one of the better ones . I know that Lindbergh was only 25 years old at the time of his historic solo flight to Paris and that James Stewart was almost 50 when making this movie but I can overlook that fact because Stewart has always been one of my all-time favorite actors and does one of his usual outstanding performances as the " " lone eagle " . " There is a good mixture of comedy and drama throughout the film and a good use of flashbacks . It also helps that James Stewart was a pilot in real life both in the military and civilian life . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" An unqualified " " 10 . " " The level of writing and acting in this Australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of " " old " " Hollywood . Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together . Neill matches Streep line for line , and take for take -- it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best , notwithstanding the intensity of his role . This engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama , portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms . The movie -- which won several top awards in Australia -- boasts not only a superlative cast and director , but wonderful and authentic Australian locales . It proves that people are the same the world over . And , after all these years , people still delight in repeating the famous Streep line , accent and all : " " A dingo ate moy baby ! " " Including that imp " " Elaine Benis " " on " " Seinfeld . " " , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is a true masterpiece , it really is . It 's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick , full of fun , laughter , heartbreak , and with a little drama to keep you on your toes . A true family film , Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave pets , who set out to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their owners , following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way . One of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice acting is that good . Shadow is a wonderful character , old , wise and brave , and watching him trying to save Sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment . Chance - who wouldn 't love a dog like Chance ? He 's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen . And Sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper ; ' Here kitty kitty kitty ... not on your life , chubby . ' There were also lots of well made emotional scenes , such as Sassy going over the waterfall ( I was truly scared for her ) , Shadow falling in the ditch ( almost in tears ) and then the fantastic ending , when all three pets return home ... including good old Shadow ! A favourite for all time - anyone who doesn 't like this film must just not like animals . Rent it or buy it now , and it 'll leave you with happy memories that 'll last a lifetime . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " October Sky " " is a film that will steal your heart , fill your mind with vivid imagery , and lift your spirit . The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first , especially when the film is set in a mining town , where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine . But Homer cannot follow in his father 's footsteps . With the encouragement of Miss Riley , ( a friendly teacher ) , members of his father 's staff , and his friends , Homer attempts to make his dream a reality.Yet as in any true to life story , there are many stops along the way . Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines , where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock . With lit helmets and bent posture , they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness . The hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work.Contrasting the mine shaft 's lugubrious load are the images of Homer and his friend 's rocket launches . Underneath the blue bowl of sky , rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time.Yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters . Homer 's father is a classic hardened man ... but he has a soft side as well . We see that he does love his son , despite their many arguments . The love and support of Miss Riley is evident as well . Best of all , the film is uncomfortable . It doesn 't tie everything up in a nice bow . It tears at you , lifts you up . It keeps an air of reality , which is important in a film like this.This film can be considered a complete work . At first , I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer 's life . I didn 't want it to end . Then I realized ... that 's what a good film does to a person . If it has done its job , you won 't want it to end . And " " October Sky " " accomplishes just that . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this movie on TV when it came out , and never seen it again . For the life of me , I couldn 't remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking Roy Thinne 's movie credits . Excellent , dark , and spooky TV horror movie in the same class as " " Crowhaven Farm " " ; " " Don 't Be Afraid Of The Dark " " ; and " " Satan 's School for Girls " , " all lost Satanic classics . I also think it has many parallels to Clint Eastwood 's classic , " " High Plains Drifter " . " Why don 't they release these great little movies , especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount DVD racks at Wal-Mart ? Most of these flicks have a cult-following , so sales shouldn 't be a problem . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . While the first credits were rolling , we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie . They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek , which was totally gay ! When we saw this , we groaned . We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek , but we were so wrong ! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek ( which really isn 't that hard ) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time ! They really redeemed themselves with this movie . It was gory , smart , and scary , which are the combinations to an awesome horror movie . Kane is awesome as Jacob Goodnight , and Christina Vidal , Samantha Noble , and Luke Pegler did pretty good jobs as part of a group of delinquents cleaning an old motel . It had some gross scenes , and you actually kinda feel sad for some of the people who die . All in all , a great horror movie to watch on a Friday or Saturday night with the lights off and with friends . Just don 't watch it in a hotel . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman 's Romeo & Juliet or Spielberg 's Titanic . Gerda 's love impresses me every time , her search , her battle is exceptional . Gerda becomes a strong , loving woman throughout the movie . Kay is the poisoner of dark forces : the temptation . This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE , for the love of my life , for Mister Right . Patience is one of the keywords of this movie . I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay . And I wish that it ends soon ... Snowqueen tells although my life , I deeply identify with the story and the characters . Thanks at least for Hans Christian Anderson and the director . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow . What a wonderful film . The script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by Minglun Wei , I hope he has more stories in him.The acting is sublime . Renying Zhou as Doggie was amazing -- very natural talent , and Xu Zhu was a delight - very believable as the jaded old traditionalist . The soundtrack was very effective , guiding without being overwhelming . If only more movies like this were made whether in Hollywood or Hong Kong- a family friendly , well acted , well written , well directed , near perfect gem . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" this is my first review on IMDb , i didn 't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now , i feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no , i 'm not associated to the movie makers in any way ( yeah yeah how often did you here that before ; - ) ) FYI i 'm in my late 20s1st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies , because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one . Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style . The characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie , after all it 's a fairytale-like world . But the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this . The blue , bunny-like mini-dragon steels the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie , he is already an instant classic , much as Scrat from Ice Age . The story is not too surprising ( a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine ) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds THAT good ; - ) 1 thing i have to point out , imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say , these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo . Anyway i had a great time watching this and can 't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it.8,5 for me , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is an extraordinary topical thriller . Fonda and Douglas are good , but Lemmon blows them away . He plays a man who must go against everything he thought was right .

" As I drove from Skagway , Alaska to Dawson City , Yukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery , I cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location . Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a magnificent place , but still not the real place where the film takes place . When the story moves to Dawson , that is when I feel Anthony Mann , who used the outdoor locations so well , could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place . James Stewart here is again a man fighting within himself , one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money , and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered . Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps , Corinne Calvet is the nice girl . Mann is excellent directing the shootouts , but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes . He uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery , the predominating white , like it was with the greens in " " The Naked Spur " " and the browns in " " The Man From Laramie " . " Like all of the Mann-Stewarts , this is a traditional western , with a difference in the elaboration of Stewart 's character which is more complex . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie explores the difficulties that strain hopes , dreams , love and friendship , and incorporates humour beautifully . Along with a stunning cast and brilliant filming , the sound track enhances and amplifies the atmosphere and mood of this work of art . All actors and actresses give an extremely good performance , surpassing expectation in every way . Parminder Nagra is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film , and she is exceptional , capturing the vividness and vitality that this movie is all about . Keira Knightly also works well with her co-stars , and this is her best work so far.All in all , this is brilliant film , and one that everyone should make the effort to see at least once . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As the celebration of Christmas has evolved through the years , whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions , it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other . That has somehow slipped past one Ebenezer Scrooge , merchant and money lender in 19th century London.As his nephew points out to his uncle , he doesn 't keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug . The humanity in Scrooge was driven out long ago , he 's a hard case , a whole lot like his 20th Century counterpart , Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls , New York.But as Charles Dickens told this tale , redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how.A Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century Great Britain as Oliver Twist was . The characters in this film are middle and lower class . The Cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in Oliver Twist , but they are having to struggle to stay up there . Still love and happiness radiate their home , no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for . Like George Bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much , Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world.Patrick Stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of Scrooge . But George C. Scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film . The meanness of him , but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change . Scott joins a fine tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim who 've both done great interpretations of Scrooge.Among the supporting roles I particularly enjoyed David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of Christmas present . According to IMDb this is one of 32 versions of A Christmas Carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy . It 's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don 't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own . The cat is named Sassy and she lives up to her name . Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound . Shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things . Put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time . There are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn 't cheesy at all . It 's the best talking animal movie that I 've seen so far . It 's a really good movie for families . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Delivers great acting and greater Special Effects . Stars David Cronenberg , one of my personal favorites , as Decker .

" Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star , he was a great actor . This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his best performances . " " Red Rock West " " was a low-budget , almost un-known film , but is one of my favorite movies of all time . I discovered it walking down the video store aisle , and wanted to see Cage and Hopper ( Who also is great in the movie ) appear together . Go get this one , and I 'm sure you won 't be disappointed . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've slowly been collecting the films available on DVD of both Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut . Both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time - fortunately Mississipi Mermaid is not one of them.Next to " " The Soft Skin " , " coincidentally staring Deneuve 's sister ( the late Francoise Dorleac ) , this would have to be my favourite Truffaut film.As well as directing , Truffaut also wrote the screenplay . Something that always strikes me about Truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story -- one could almost call it naivety.There 's a scene towards the end of the film where Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon with the remains of the loot . He rings the doorbell and Deneuve answers wearing a negligee . In the time it takes Belmondo to reach their room from the street , Deneuve changes into her dress , puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes , then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep . It 's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child - but that 's Truffaut for you.Watching Catherine Deneuve in her films of the late 60 's is indeed a sensory pleasure . She is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch . Incidentally , for those fans , there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film - indeed a sinful pleasure.I disagree with previous posters . I see nothing ' Hitchcockian ' about the film at all . As for the ' look ' of it - i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60 's . It certainly gives films of this period a unique look.Highly recommended for both Deneuve and Truffaut fans ...... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I went into a screening of " " SISTER HELEN " " at the Sundance Film Festival and did not know what to expect.I was riveted by the people in this documentary . Sister Helen is an incredible character ! ! ! The filmmakers captured the essence of Sister Helen 's amazing soul and took me into a world unknown . I was thoroughly satisfied by the journey and was completely caught off guard by this film 's ending.This film speaks to those who desire a second chance at life . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Not since " " Harold and Maude " " has suicide been so successfully used as the theme for a love story . The acting , by a top notch cast is terrific . With a well structured script , things progress at an enjoyable pace . There are moments of black comedy , but I would classify " " My Suicidal Sweetheart " " as a unique romantic comedy , with a touch of dark humor . The relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers , is both touching and engaging . The movie actually makes you question , what is a normal relationship ? I highly recommend " " My Suicidal Sweetheart " . " Seek it out on DVD under the title " " Crazy for Love " . " You will not be disappointed . - MERK , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I must admit , I was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it . I determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by Ronald D. Moore wielding the retcon-wand.I was wrong ! The pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers . The accessibility is marvelous ! Of course , seasoned BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot , which is focused on the development of the Cylons before the first War . ( 58 years before the events of the BSG pilot ) . The pilot also allows for newcomers , clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.Don 't be mistaken : " " Caprica " " is not BSG . We are presented with an immersive , cerebral drama dotted by provocative , daring , and controversial ideas . The casting maintains BSG 's standards ; Stoltz and Morales are simply astounding . Morales ' portrayal of Joseph Adama , inspired by Olmos ' portrayal of William , gives a wonderful glimpse of William 's heroic father . Stoltz 's portrayal of Dr. Graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions.If the quality of the pilot is any indication of what 's yet to come , RDM and the creative team are set to continue BSG 's legacy of first-rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Though I saw this movie dubbed in French , so I 'm sure it lost something in the translation , lack of accents , etc . , it was an excellent , fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room--a real pick-me-up that portrayed accurately and positively the complexities of individual sexuality , gender role , and finding a place within the communities to which one is supposed to belong--male , gay , urban , 30-ish , etc . I was very proud of French television for showing such an honest and positive portrayal of the gay community . While the fact that the gay lead character ends up somewhat " " straight " " in the end is mildly disappointing , that 's life , and that happens sometimes . This is a great movie , whether alone or with a date ! A really enjoyable experience . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Yes . Bam cried a couple times and so did Englund . And most probably you will too .

Right from the get-go you 're laughing , and believe you me , don 't plan on resting that smile of yours . I personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first . You know when you go into a theater , and you kind of don 't want to have high expectations for it ..... well , this movie blows all expectations away . If you love Jackass , you can go into this with gigantic expectations . No matter what you 'll laugh your ass off . If you 're not laughing , the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you were eating Jack Sh ! t for breakfast and Jack left town .

" For some inexplicable reason , Jerry 's movies often seemed to come in for diatribes from certain quarters although they were rarely box office disappointments . It 's one of life 's great mysteries to me because his films have always had a ' feel good ' factor about them for me . But this film is not only not bad : it 's an exceedingly good and clever comedy . To those who may be tickled by ' modern ' crude or cruel humour , don 't see this film : There 's nothing in it like that and you 'll be wasting your time.I 've only seen this film once on the television . I 've waited ever since to see it again and that 's been quite a few years . You 'd think the idea of an arrogant millionaire businessman heading off to win the war against the Nazis with his own small private army of subservient employees would be boring wouldn 't you ? Well only Jerry Lewis would dare try such a plot for an out and out comedy and it works , I have to say , brilliantly.I think that , as with ' The Nutty Professor ' and most of his other films , this movie is testimony to his comic genius , both in concept and execution . I think Buddy Love might have said , " " You know , true comedy can not only make a six year old hysterical , it 'll do that for his Dad too . " " Maybe a few nutty Nazis generals with monocles and a limp would dislike this movie , honestly . If you only see one more comedy in your life , see this one .

" This is one of the most brilliant movies that I have seen in recent times . Goes way above even any international movie of any repute . I am really surprised why this has not received the recognition it deserved . Sonali Kulkarni winning the National Award is perhaps the only consoling fact . Renuka Daftardar simply amazes as she speaks volumes through her eyes . There are a few scenes that stand out : When Gauri comes back from the city on Krishna 's wedding , she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years . Krishna notices a change in Gauri , but not a single line of dialogue is said . The entire gamut of emotions is conveyed through subtle mannerisms and the eyes . There 's another towards the end when Krishna pleads to Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead . If you are not moved by that scene , you don 't have a heart.Watch this movie for sheer movie-making brilliance and acting capabilities . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Babs Johnson ( Divine ) lives in a trailer with her son Crackers , her daughter Cotton and her mother Edie ( Edie Massey ) . She 's in competition with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles ( Mink Stole , David Lochary ) to be named the filthiest person alive . The film shows their attempts to outdo each other.This film is very much NOT for everyone . It 's a in your face no holds barred assault in bad taste . Crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches ; the Marbles pick up female hitchhikers , impregnate them , keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples ; Divine and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc . It 's disgusting but , in a way , not unwatchable . It 's SO over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it 's kind of fascinating . As director John Waters might say , it 's bad taste done well . Also it 's kind of amusing to watch--the acting is so wretched ( especially by Massey ) that you just watch it in disbelief . A friend laughed out loud at how bad Massey was ( she improved in later pictures ) .This is NOT for people who are easily offended . Even though it 's over 30 years old it 's STILL shocking .

" Now i really liked this movie , it was so funny.Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors , i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future.Akshay Kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time , but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch , he acted really well int his film and i hope that he makes more great comedy 's like this one in the future , John Abraham plays his best friend , he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really Good actor. i just love John , Neha Dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well.The muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" While caricatures and / or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one , they aren 't used in quantity here . Most of the individual gags are rather generic . As I 'm going to give examples , there will be spoilers below : There are only three ( well , technically four-there 's a quick one at the very end of the cartoon ) caricatures that I spotted , which is kind of low for this type of short , though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity . They are Jack Benny ( as Jack Bunny ) , Leopold Stowkowski and the inimitable Ned Sparks ( as a crab on a can-chances are very good that , if a crab was involved in a Warner Brothers short in the 1930s-1940s , the caricature used would be Ned Sparks ) . There are also references to Billy Rose 's Aquacade and a riff on a radio show character called " " Henry Aldrich " " ( Coming , mother ! ) , a play on Superman ( Superguy here ) and the villain is a take-off on " " King Kong " . " That 's it for that kind of gag.The products themselves are mostly generic and the gags are more plays on basic items in unusual situations , such as turtles coming off of cans of soup to attack the villain as tanks , tomato soup cans doing " " The can-can ' , gingerbread men who turn into paratroopers , using tissues for parachutes and so on . The gags are very good and it 's an excellent example of a Bob Clampett cartoon . Clampett had hit his stride as a director by this point and while it isn 't anywhere near his best work , it 's nothing to sneeze at either . This short can be found on Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Vol . 3 , which is an excellent set that I highly recommend . This short itself is also recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Anna ( Charlotte Burke ) develops a strange fever that causes her to pass out and drift off into a world of her own creation . A bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the inhabitant of an old dumpy house in the middle of a lonely field . Lacking in detail , much like any child drawing the house and it 's inhabitant Marc ( who can 't walk because Anna didn 't draw him any legs ) are inhabitants of this purgatory / limbo world . Anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure what 's what and in the process tries to help save the boy , but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her , but trap her and Marc there forever.Wow ! Is a good word to sum up Bernard Rose 's brilliantly haunting and poetic Paperhouse . A film that is so simple that it 's damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget . While you may find this puppy in your horror section it 's anything but . It 's more of a serious fantasy , expertly directed , and exceptionally well acted by it 's cast , in particular Charlotte Burke and Elliot Speirs ( Marc ) . And yet , it 's not a children 's movie either , but meant to make us remember those carefree days of old that are now just dark memories . Rose creates a rich tapestry of moody ambiance that creates a thrilling backdrop for the brilliant story and great actors to play with . Paperhouse stays away from trying to explain it 's more dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the viewers imagination . There 's much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into . Paperhouse enjoys playing games with the viewers mind , engrossing you with it 's very own sense of reasoning . As the story unfolded I was again and again impressed at just how powerful the film managed to be up to the finale which left me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye.Bernard Rose 's visuals are brilliant here . He 's able to create an unnervingly bleak atmosphere that appears simple on the surface , but as a whole is much greater than the sum of it 's parts . The acting is of young Charlotte Burke in this , her feature debut , is a truly impressing as well . Unfortunately she 's not graced the screen since . A much deserved Burnout Central award only seems proper for that performance . Toward the end the movie lags a bit here and there , but I was easily able to overlook it . I wished they had took a darker turn creating a far more powerful finale that would have proved to be all the more unnerving and truly riveting in retrospect . The movie as is , is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious film lover . It 's a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child , a powerful film in which much is left to be pondered and far more to be praised . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is an evocative and idealized portrait of the early life of Lincoln ( born 1809 Hodgensville-Kentucky- and died in Washington 1865 ) . Ford 's excellent movie takes Abraham Lincoln ( Fonda ) from his youth . He studied laws , common law and began practice as lawyer in 1837.This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his log-cabin days , initial relationship to Mary Todd ( Weaver ) , following the couple from their first ball , and his departure for congress candidate . But focuses mainly on a brothers ( Richard Cromwell , Eddie Quillan ) accused for murder , the posterior trial with amusing court debate scenes and the protection for their mum ( Alice Brady ) . The Lincoln-Fonda as defender advocate and Donald Meek-prosecutor are nothing short of brilliant.Excellent performance from Henry Fonda as idealistic , traveller Springfield solicitor , he was to star regularly for Ford from this movie , as 짢Grapes of wrath , My darling Clementine , and Fort Apache짢 . Besides sterling acting by Alice Brady as grieved mother , she was a great actress from the silent cinema , but this one results to be her last movie because she early died from cancer.The Lincoln 's deeds developing make for skilfully appealing entertaining.His portrayal shows a nostalgic longing for things past and old values and describes his goodness , uprightness and willful . Lincoln , like John Ford , was a straightforward man who never varied the ideals of his youth.This American masterpiece is correct on both counts , as splendid biography and as magnificent drama.Another biographies about Abraham Lincoln are the following : 1 ) 짢Abraham Lincoln짢 ( 1930 ) by D.W.Griffith with Walter Huston , Una Merkel , talking from his birth until his assassination ; 2 ) 짢Abe Lincoln in Illinois짢 ( 1940 ) by John Cromwell with Raymond Massey , Ruth Gordon , concerning similar events to Ford 's film through his career as lawyer 3 ) TV version titled 짢Gore Vidal 's Lincoln짢 with Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" First , the positives : an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film . Some of the shots could be paintings by De Chirico . Sophie Marceau , beautiful.The negatives : the stories are hard to believe . Unreal , uni-dimensional characters preen and posture 100 % of the time , as if they were in some kind of catwalk . This is neither the Antonioni of his earlier , much better movies nor the Wenders we 've all come to know and appreciate . Malkovich is excess baggage in this movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I never heard of Mishima before I watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious , I still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box . At the beginning of the film , we are told about a celebrated Japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public . As the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of Mishima 's mind . The stages of his life are are presented in four chapters . Each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives , the first continues the story with scenes from Mishima 's life and appear in black and white . The second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged like a play and filmed in vivid colours . There is a different novel staged in each chapter . Between each chapter , the narrative returns to the present , as Mishima proceeds towards his eventual ritual suicide . This means that the drama and tension is maintained until the end.I suspect that many people will find this film to be boring pretentious and art-house . I respect that , this is not a film for people who want action and a strong story line . If on the other hand you are the kind of person who relishes the opportunity to penetrate the mind a bizarre man while watching his life story told in collage of beautiful pictures set to music by Philip Glass , you will love it . I loved it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" POSSIBLE SPOILER - In some way " " How to Alienate Friends .... " " is the " " loser learns to adjust , becomes successful and finds out that something else matter more " " type of story , situated in the celebrity business . - END OF SPOILER I don 't know the original book but this comedy delivers several good moments . Though I do think the ending is flawed . It felt too fast and too abrupt , as if something was missing . Besides I 'd say the movie isn 't able to keep a high level . Apart from this you 'll find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities . Until now I 've never seen Pegg any different . Still he is a very unique type though on the screen he sometimes might seem a little more tedious than necessary . Fox proved she is capable to play a hot starlet with her head in the clouds . Don 't know whether it was a hard thing to do , but her performance was hot and way better than during " " Transformers " " ( okay ... probably that 's no tough match ) . Kirsten Dunst is very much Kirsten Dunst ( again ) and you may like it ( as I do ) or find it annoying . On the other hand you 'll see Anderson who proved her acting skills and Jeff Bridges ( who is fine but perhaps he could have acted a little more powerful ) . They all fit their character well enough.Conclusion : I think it 's a nice celeb comedy with some more and some less funny passages , a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

At that time , it was the game of upper class and rich " " gentlemen " , " and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs . With this backdrop , this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young , working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world , Harry Vardon.And the story is inspirational . Against all odds , Francis Ouimet ( played by Shia LaBeouf of " " Holes " " ) gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U.S. and Great Britain at the 1913 U.S. Open . Francis is ill-prepared , and has a child for a caddy . ( The caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in . ) But despite these handicaps , Francis displays courage , spirit , heroism , and humility at this world class event.And , we learn a lot about the early years of golf ; for example , the use of small wooden clubs , the layout of the short holes , the manual scoreboard , the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths , the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways , and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.This film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing . And with no big movie stars , the story is somehow more believable.This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of " " Miracle " " and " " Remember the Titans .

" SPOILERS Edgar Rice Burroughs 's famous character was adapted thousand of times for the screen til one 's thirst is quenched , notably during the thirties and the forties by Hollywood . Its productors made Tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters . Several years later , Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkey-man and it 's a more natural , more wild and more down-to-earth Tarzan that he gives away here . Hudson skilfully avoids the clich챕s that you usually grant to Tarzan such as his famous scream or his friendly pet , Cheetah . Not only , are we far from the designed and invented character made by Hollwood but we are also far from the film set used to make his stories . The movie was partly made in Africa ( more precisely in Cameroon ) . The movie introduces two obvious parts : the first one which takes place in the jungle where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends , the apes and considers himself as their lord . But he ignores his real origins . The second one in England where Tarzan discovers the English society . Ian Holm epitomizes the link between the two parts and Hudson avoids all that could make the movie falls into the ridiculous thanks to a clever screenplay . Indeed , Holm teaches Lambert basic rules of manners so as to behave correctly in the English society and the result works . Moreover , in the second part , no-one ever laughs at Tarzan and he 's even really appreciated . As far as the end is concerned well it 's a both bitter and happy end . Happy because Tarzan comes back to the jungle and meets again his adoptive close relatives . But bitter too , because this homecoming means that the Greystoke line won 't be ensured and is condemned to disappear ... Christophe Lambert finds here , his first ( and last ? ) great role . Sadly , he 'll never equal the achievement of his performance in this movie and he 'll play in poor and insipide action movies . Nevertheless , as I said previously , a clever screenplay , a performance of a rare quality , some impressive natural sceneries ( both the jungle and the English country and we get a gorgeous movie . It 's also an excellent rereading from a popular novel . So why is it only rated barely ( 6 / 10 ) ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more of Robin Williams , then Mork & Mindy . Still , thought it was great . We got to see , Robin always being ' on ' , no matter what . The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players , seem so real to me . Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful . He was so charming in this , which helped me get through all the Williams energy . The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows ( Happy Days , and Laverne & Shirley ) , was enlightening . I also thought Richmond-Peck 's Harvey was also a nice rock in the pond . ( This is a good thing ) .This movie told the age old story of Hollywood folks , going through the ups and downs of stardom . It kept me glued to my TV , and I learned to love Robin , well hell , mostly everybody seem to be the super people I sometimes think Hollywood is . Go figure.I sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots . We never saw the head of ABC . Just heard him , like Charlie from Charlie Angels ( I wonder if this way planed ? ) . It seems so sad , that a show at number 1 , could be so destroy by their own network.I think this story could be told about anyone 's life , as they climb the ladder of any job . Movie , and TV stars are always loved or hated by so many people , that you grew up with , you just want to reach back in their past , to remember your own past . I Remember watching the show , and always wondering what does happen in their personal lives.Mork and Mindy , will always be part of me , and I got to see part of them .

" Just got out of an advance screening , and wow was this movie hilarious . Possibly better than the first one , but at least its equal . If you don 't like jackass , or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity ( way more than in the first ) then stay far , far away . But if you dig the whole Jackass thing , then this movie will not disappoint . Toro Totter is the greatest invention ever . OK. so my review wasn 't long enough ... All else i have to say is poor , poor Dunn , they really kick the crap out of him in this . So if you enjoy masochistic humor , and prolific male nudity , and by far the most disgusting female nudity ever ( John Waters is involved , need i say more ? ) then this movie will keep you in stitches for it entirety .

" " " Batman : The Mystery of the Batwoman " " is about as entertaining as animated Batman movies get.While still true to the feeling of the comic books , the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series . Bruce Wayne looks much like he has before , but now he appears somewhat less imposing . The Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by the less edgy , more youthful Tim Drake Robin.Kevin Conroy , as usual , invokes the voice of Batman better than most live action actors.Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voice-acting job than I was expecting.As in the live action Batman films , the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains . My all-time favorite , the Penguin , is here . His design is sleeker than it has appeared before , hearkening more to the Burgess Meredith portrayal of the ' 60 's than the Danny DeVito portrayal of " " Batman Returns . " " David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the Penguin 's voice . The Penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate , just as he most commonly appears in the comics . Hector Elizondo 's voice creates a Bane who 's much more memorable than the forgettable version in " " Batman & Robin . " " And finally , Batman has a descent mystery to solve , putting the " " Detective " " back in " " Detective Comics " " ( that is what " " DC " " stands for , after all . ) The revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist.The score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie . It sounds like a mix between the score from " " Poirot " " and the score from " " Mission : Impossible . " " All in all , it 's more entertaining than your average cartoon . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad it may look . His debut , Hustle and Flow , was one of my favorites from that year , with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic , fallible characters . I wasn 't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort . The cast seemed great , the trailer used music effectively , however , it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity , and fast . Fortunately , Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on . The acting is astonishing , the writing superb , and the editing style , as well as juxtaposed music , riveting the whole way . Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption.The first moment I knew I was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning . Like he did with Hustle and Flow , Brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically . The 70 's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema 's best . From here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both Lazarus and Rae , each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross . The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose . Rae 's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz 's wife leaves him for his brother . Each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situation혰Rae to sex and Laz to the bottle . Only when Rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear.Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him . There are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his captive / patient . You never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well . Also , the character of Rae is not chained up for very long , despite what the trailers would have you believe . The situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two . As for that chained girl , Christina Ricci really shines . I never really saw her as anything special , but this role is a true breakthrough for her . This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down . Any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away . Her nymphomania is not for pleasure , but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids . Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism . Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake , again showing some real acting talent . Where this guy came from I have no clue , but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out.While not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow , Moan still ranks equally to it , in my mind , because when it is on , it is spectacular . Towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with " " This Little Light of Mine " " singing out , and earlier , the interaction between captive and captor , when the chain is first introduced , shows some top-notch work . The truly magical moment , though , is when Jackson sings ( yes that is him throughout , like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle ) the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker . If I don 't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year , I won 't be surprised . What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of . One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer 's work is the fact that he doesn 't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes . Instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been , or how bad life has been , everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people . We don 't have saints here , but fallible people looking to right their ship . If the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness , no one really knows , but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" When it comes to political movies I usually come out feeling empty . They generally take up some moralistic stance and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some sort of Batman movie.But with Lumumba it is the first movie I 've seen that showed politics for what it is , and the real issues of trying to rule a country of broken people who have known no other rule but violence . There were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest . This is the only political movie in my opinion that one can come out of it truly learning something . Especially for anyone with their eye on politics as a career this movie shows you , you cannot rule on what you want for a country , but what the country wants from you.That 's why I disagree with a lot of reviews that say everyone comes of bad , I think they come of too idealistic , ( the Belgians want the perfect colony , Lumumba wants a perfect Unity Congo , Tshombe wants wealth and riches , America wants the perfect ally against communism , Russia wants the perfect aide for Communism ) . And the Congolese ? They come off used and abused , ( best example in the movie when G챕n챕ral Janssens tells his black troops your government lied to you and it leaves them all in an uproar ) they are always being pulled and pushed into supporting this person or another.This movie shows in politics a mistake can cost you dearly and this movie everyone makes mistake after mistake until it escalates and ends up destroying the country . Their intentions might be good ( or at least in the characters opinion ) , but it 's everyone 's mistakes that lead to the downfall of Congo . I don 't think anyone is bad in this film , I just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking.Overall , it 's not just the best political film , it is a great film in general . Acting is fabulous ( Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba was perfect casting I really believe him ) script flawless , editing perfect pace , and production value higher than I expected for a central African film . A must watch . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this originally on Channel 4 ( UK ) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me . However I saw it on Irish TV recently and there was an added narration by Roy Scheider ( " " we 're going to need a bigger boat ! " " ) . This ruined the film for me . His droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film , and if anything takes from the films brilliance . I wonder at the new DVD version that has no Roy ( due to legal reasons ? ) would stop people from buying it . Well believe me , the film is much better for it !

" As with some of the best films and series , I stumbled across this quite by accident . It was late , a storm was in full force outside and I was sitting comfortably on the sofa when I flicked past a channel that was just about to show one of the episodes . I intended merely to watch a couple of minutes while waiting for the commercials to be finished on another channel before switching back to some or other sitcom . About an hour and a half later I remembered my resolve and was so happy that I hadn 't done that . Needless to say I made sure I saw all the other episodes.John Hannah has been brilliant in almost everything I have seen him in and he does not let down here either . All other cast members do a stellar job too . My personal favourite ( aside from John Hannah , of course ) is Gerard Murphy.The only negative side to this series are the limited amount of episodes . Only 8 with JH himself and an additional 1 with someone else . I would love to see McCallum back on the screens , though it would have to be with JH ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following , then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected . In Memento , Nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly . We were able to tell when it was the past , when it 's current , etc . However , Nolan experimented with it a little , and it just doesn 't work . Although he had a small budget and couldn 't use color ( which is one way Memento worked ) , it was just too hard to distinguish between time . On the DVD is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order . I intended to write my review after watching it , so hopefully it would make more sense , but , of course , it wasn 't working.You can 't blame Nolan for not coming up with original ideas . A young man , Bill ( Jeremy Theobald ) , is bored , so he decides to follow random people on the street . He finds one , Cobb ( Alex Haw ) , that particularly interests him . Soon , Bill becomes friends with Cobb and goes with him as he breaks into houses and robs them . Then , a saucy young blond ( Lucy Russell ) enters , and the movie becomes even weirder from there.The ending of Following is one of the most shocking endings I 've seen . Sure , Fight Club had an amazing ending , but the way that Following 's ending played out was amazing . I felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion . Nolan has a thing for making good endings ( well , maybe not , I could guess Insomnia 's from a mile away ) , and can really construct a great story . Following may not be the easiest to follow or look at , but it 's such a finely crafted , original story with a shocker ending that you 'll probably want to watch all of its 70 minutes again.My rating : 7 / 10Rated R for language and some violence . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger 's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants . Funny , horribly so . The invented yarn takes " " The Dirty Dozen " " for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies . Lots of fun . Even " " Paris when it sizzles " " is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog . I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer 's character and by his sensational performance . Brad Pitt creates a true original . I love the actor 's lack of vanity . There 's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt .

" What starts out as generational conflict in this movie , ends in understanding , solemnity and grace . The movie meanders through Europe with the father and the young son cramped in a car over 3000 miles . The cramping forces lifestyles , beliefs and life skills to collide . There 's really no clear winner . It all adds up in the end as experience , experience of multiple layers of life . For those interested in understanding Islam , this movie offers a generous and gentle outlook , without being pushy about the agenda . It 's a coming of age story for the young son , his dismissive and rebellious nature turning to openness for receiving more ways of life . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" To my surprise I quite enjoyed ' Spacecamp ' , i remember seeing it about 13 years ago , and recently I hired it again . I was quite impressed . Obviously the special effects in todays space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those in SpaceCamp . However , this film had a story- a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it . But thats what I liked about it- they don 't make films like this anymore , so it was a refreshing change . It was interesting to see Kelly Preston , Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in early roles , with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add substance to the light & fluffy plot . Absolutely loved the robot named Jinx , it was very cute , but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters . The film was almost inspirational in its own way , and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the NASA Spacecamp in Alabama ( i think ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times . The acting in this film is not bad , but definetly not great either . Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film , I mean who does he think he is , Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington ? He does 1 half-good movie and won 't do a film for less than $ 20 million . And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it . But enough about , in my eyes , the worst character of the film . Kate Winslet 's performance on the other hand was wonderful . I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together . There is one lesson to be learned about this movie : there are too many love-stories as it is , filmmakers shouldn 't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie ! ! ! Out of a possible 100 % I give this film a mere 71 % . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better . The last one , Heaven Can Wait , was great , I suggest you see that one . This one is not so great . The last third of the movie is not so bad and Chris Rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today . However , I don 't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie . It plays like some really bad " " B " " movie where people sound like they are in some bad TV sit-com . The situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie . It all seems real fake and the editing is just bad . I don 't know how they could release this movie like that . Anyway , the last part isn 't to bad , so wait for the video and see it then . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I like this episode quite a bit , Ruth Gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was . As has been stated , the music is very good , and it has a moodiness that doesn 't exist in all episodes.But one major plot hole exists , so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it . It is established that the light doesn 't work in the vault . Don 't you think that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked ? You 'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note . Granted this is TV whodunit fiction , and various holes will always be found , but this seems much too glaring.It really doesn 't make Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn 't work but the " " death bed " " testimony goes on unfound , apparently for days . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Suzumiya Haruhi no y청utsu ( The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya ) might at a first glance make you think that this is just another animated school comedy / drama . Well , it 's not ! The setting just happen to be a school environment . This is a comedy alright , but a very smart one with a lot of sarcasm . And the characters does have a psychological sublimeness which is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of Ingmar Bergman . The episodes is aired , as it seems , out of order , i.e. the pilot is in fact episode 11 . This makes it possible to present small clues to upcoming episodes . The show is an adaption of Nagaru Tanigawa 's popular novel series about Haruhi Suzumiya.What about the story then ? Like in all the episodes does the story revolves Haruhi Suzumiya , who tries to ease her own boredom by embarking in adventures . Haruhi her self has no interest in ordinary humans , and actively searches for aliens , time travelers and espers ( persons with supernatural forces ) . To find this sort of people she has formed a club which she calls the SOS-Brigade ( Save the world by Overloading it with fun : Haruhi Suzumiyas Brigade ) . Except for Haruhi , the other members of the SOS-brigade is Kyon . He is the real protagonist of the show . It 's trough his point of view that we follow the story . He just happen to sit in front in class when Haruhi came up with the idea to form the SOS-Brigade . He is quite sceptical to most club activities and tags along just to ensure that Haruhi don 't go to much to the extremes , and he is the only one in the class that Haruhi likes to talk with . Another member is Yuki Nagato , which is the " " indispensable silent member " " and is also the only remaining member of the Literature club , which room the SOS-Brigade has occupied in the quest for a free club room . She doesn 't mind that the SOS-Brigade uses her clubroom , as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books . She also participate in the brigades activities . Mikuru Asahina was " " voluntarily arrested " " by Haruhi because the club needed a Lolita-like mascot for anything suspicious to happen . She often act as the clubs maid . The last member is the always smiling Itsuki Koizumi , who happens to be the " " mysterious transfer student " " ( meaning he transfered two months in to the semester which Haruhi finds to qualifies as mysterious ) .Haruhi thinks that all members but Kyon are some random picked people in school , but the do indeed have their own interest in her . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've always loved " " Gone With The Wind " " and have seen it numerous times . However , its ending left me not only " " hanging , " " but depressed , with a hopeless feeling . Finally , in " " Scarlett , " " Ripley took us to a very plausible and satisfying end ( " " beginning " " ) of the original story.It follows that someone of Scarlett 's obvious intelligence ( as originally written ) would eventually grow up . Although , like most people , I fell in love with Scarlett in GWTW , I tired of her constant insipid infantiilism to the point of exasperation , and I was disappointed that Mitchell did not show Scarlett using that obvious intelligence to even make an attempt to grow emotionally . Thankfully , someone finally did . ( After all , isn 't that nagging immaturity that conflicted with her beauty and intelligence the very reason Rhett finally gave up on her in the first place ? ) I think Ripley did an excellent job of describing that long-overdue process , and Whalley-Kilmer did a superb job of portraying it . Joanne W-K has all the fire , exuberance and intelligent sparkle as did Vivian Leigh , and she is certainly at least as , if not more , beautiful.There was , is , and always will be only one Clark Gable . However , if I had to pick an actor out of the thousands to which I 've been exposed to portray him in his biography , it would definitely be Timothy Dalton . Dalton possesses the same elegant charm that Gable did , which is essential for Rhett 's character . I can 't imagine anyone else who could come close.In my opinion , both Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were superbly cast and the only actors who could have possibly played Scarlett and Rhett . I think both their performances did justice to not only the late actors but also the spirit of their characters.I enjoyed the whole cast . Julie Harris was her usual delightful presence , and Jean Smart was an adorable kick ! Even Ashley 's character was nicely played by Stephen Collins , and the progression of his relationship with Scarlett was totally believable.The story became a little convoluted in Ireland , but so is life , after all , and I still found it entertaining.All in all , I thoroughly enjoyed the fruits of Ripley 's imagination . I wish I 'd written it ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " We 're both stumbling around together in this unformed world , whose rules and objectives are largely unknown , seemingly indecipherable or even possibly nonexistent , always on the verge of being killed by forces that we don 't understand . " " So says Ted Pikul in the film . Which for some people sums up life and ' eXistenZ ' probably is a film about existence . What is real and what is unreal and how you tell the difference . Or not . The last line of the film is superbly ambiguous.The film seems like a shaggy dog story ( indeed it has a real shaggy dog in it ) but it takes you along on an interesting ride , full of provocative Cronenberg touches that will make you look at amphibians , game pods , fish , spines and bones in a new light . Some bits are quite icky . It takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called ' GAS STATION ' and a Chinese restaurant is called ' CHINESE RESTAURANT . ' The film has an engrossing texture that is leagues away from your usual big budget science fiction movie.You can read many things into the film and it repays watching more than once.The main actors are Jude Law who is OK and Jennifer Jason Leigh who is great . Some roles don 't suit this very talented actor but when she has a good role like this she is unmatchable . Her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice suits the part of Allegra . ( Looks great in a short black skirt too . ) There are other familiar actors but they are not given much to do . It looks good , sounds good and a Howard Shore score complements the film very well . Cronenberg is possibly the Alfred Hitchcock of the sci-fi / horror genre . No matter what film he makes he is always worth watching . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week . What 's the problem here ? Folks admit that the performances are great--I mean , Lange is stellar ! --and that the film is good-looking , but it 's got less than a ' 6' ! I don 't get it . Come on ! The writing 's not that bad ! Having read a lot of Pulitzer-winning novels , and having seen a lot of the films based on them , I think a better-than-decent job was done in bringing the screenplay together . I thought the paring down of all the dialogue in the novel was executed almost perfectly . This story had a pretty hefty amount of dialogue in it , and the story really came through on the screen despite the fact that only a portion of it was used . * * BOOK SPOILER PART * * I was , however , a little disappointed in the Ginny-tries-to-kill-Rose subplot 's being omitted . I thought that was one of the more emotionally jarring parts of the book , but it was probably a good bet to leave it out . Avid movie-goers , more than avid readers , I think , tend to be less forgiving of protagonists pulling antagonistic stuff . It 's apt to confuse Johnny Lunchpail and Joe Sixpack.If you loved the book , you will like the movie . If you hated the book , you will likely hate the movie . * * * * * * * * Rog , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I did not have too much interest in watching The Flock.Andrew Lau co-directed the masterpiece trilogy of Infernal Affairs but he had been fired from The Flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called Niels Mueller.I had the feeling that Lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study , so they fired him and hired another director.This usually does not work well ( let 's remember The Invasion ) .But The Flock resulted to be better than what I expected.It 's not a great film but it 's an interesting and entertaining thriller.The character development is very well done and I could know the characters very well.Also , the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible.Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances.Now , let 's go to the negative points.One element which really bothered me ( there was a moment in which it irritated me ) was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more " " attitude " " and style.That tricks feel out of place and their presence is arbitrary.Plus , I think the film should have been more ambitious.In spite of that , I recommend The Flock as a good thriller.It 's not memorable at all , but it 's entertaining . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Lifeforce starts in outer space where the HMS Churchill tracks Haley 's Comet & it 's equipment detects a 150 mile long alien spaceship in the head of the comet , unable to contact Earth because of interference Colonel Tom Carlsen ( Steve Railsback ) decides this is the one & only chance to investigate it . Going outside in spacesuits Carlsen & some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship & find the remains of a bat like race of creatures & three perfect looking humanoids , two men ( Chris Jagger & Bill Malin ) & a beautiful woman ( Mathilda May ) all of whom they take aboard the Churchill . Thirty days later & back on Earth the Churchill is detected on radar , a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out & all the crew supposedly dead . The rescue team do find the three humanoid aliens though & take them back to Earth where in a space research center in London they come back to life & start to literally suck the lifeforce out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust , things look grim as the epidemic spreads throughout London ... This English production was produced by the notorious Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus who during the early 80 's were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company Cannon usually starring Chuck Norris & they wanted to move into the big time & signed director Tobe Hooper up on a three film deal ( which were this Lifeforce , the Invaders from Mars ( 1986 ) remake & The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 ( 1986 ) a sequel to Hooper 's own classic ) all of which flopped & basically bankrupt both Golan & Globus & Cannon was no more . Anyway , despite being a commercial flop at the box-office I have to say I think Lifeforce is a highly enjoyable , if rather silly sci-fi horror . When originally released into theatres back in ' 85 Lifefore was cut down to 101 minutes by Golan & Globus but over the past few years the longer 116 minute cut has all but replaced it on DVD , VHS , Laserdisc & TV although apparently Hooper 's original cut of the film ran for 128 minutes so there 's even more footage out there somewhere . I will be basing my comments on the longer 116 minute cut , the script by Dan O 'Bannon , Don Jakoby & uncredited rewrites by Michael Armstrong & Olaf Pooley was based on the 1976 novel ' The Space Vampires ' by Colin Wilson & has many extraordinary ideas , it 's scope is truly ambitious & one felt that it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of an entertaining one . It moves along like a rocket & at heart there 's a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into a tangle . There are also some hilarious moments in Lifeforce , the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female Vampire to surrender by offering her a half eaten biscuit is a true camp classic , the horribly overwrought hypnosis scenes including the one where Railsback ends up kissing Patrick Stewart & many , many more besides . I don 't know , call me weird but I just thought Lifeforce was tremendous fun & highly entertaining in just about every way , from silly character 's , odd dialogue , strange ideas that never quite come together & some terrific visuals Lifeforce certainly isn 't a film that will bore you.Director Hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has ( double what he had for Poltergeist ( 1982 ) even ) & he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen , John Dykstra the guy responsible for Star Wars ( 1977 ) , Star Trek : The Motion Picture ( 1979 ) & more recently Spider-Man ( 2002 ) was brought in to handle the visual effects & generally speaking they look fabulous . The sequences set in outer space with spaceships in particular look great , there 's also some really good visual effects back on Earth including the destruction of London as 100 's of blue souls fly around everywhere . There 's some nudity but not much gore , there are some withered corpses , a few gunshot wounds , the skin on someones hand peels off , blood spurts from someones eyes , nose & ears & there 's a severed arm as well as some zombies . The special make-up effects are also generally very good . I wouldn 't say Lifeforce is scary as such as it 's more of a sci-fi film than horror , I loved the way Hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps rotating his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness & that there is no ' solid ' floor as it were.With a supposed budget of about $ 25,000,000 it made less than half that in it 's theatrical run & hasn 't set the world alight on video or DVD either which is a shame because although it 's a bit of a mess it 's very enjoyable to watch . Shot on location in England . Well filmed in 2 : 35 : 1 widescreen , the 4 : 3 cropped image is horrible & cuts huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen , this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes it 's hard to make out what 's going on & the sense of the vastness of space & the alien spaceship is lost . The acting is OK in a very silly film , Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gielgud , Nancy Paul replaced Olivia Hussey , Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski while Anthony Hopkins turned the role of Caine down.Lifeforce is a bizarre film , no two ways about it really & anyone looking for something simple & straight forward should look elsewhere . Anyone looking for something a bit different in the sci-fi genre than give Lifeforce a go as it 's one of those so bad it 's good films with some impressive effects & it isn 't your average run of the mill film by any means . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This film was made thirteen years before I was born but I still think it is the wittiest , dottiest , most harmless piece of fun ever made . It simply could not go wrong with the cast of superb British character actors it boasts.Where to start ? Alastair Sim-peerless ; Margaret Rutherford-ditto ; the wonderfully alkward , innocent Gossage , played to perfection by the imperious Joyce Grenfell . The caddish Victor Hyde-Brown ( a Guy Middleton special ) and the rest of the staff sum up post-war middle-class England to a tee.The humour is sometimes obvious , but it is of that special " " Ealing " " variety and is never offensive.I have watched this film more times than I care to remember and still laugh like a drain at the antics every time . The storming of the dorms occupied by the girls school , the magnificently-planned but ultimately doomed twin tours of the school and the chaotic ending involving the arrival of a third school to add to the anarchy , are priceless.It 's an old clich챕 I know , but they really do not make them like that anymore . How I wish they did . If you haven 't seen it , please do , you won 't be disappointed . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" She 's not Michael JordanThink of all the marvelous NBA players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth . Their names might trip as easily off the public 's lips as Russell , Cousy , Byrd , Magic , McHale , Oscar , Wilt , the list goes on ; but the volume gets turned down a little , for Stockton and Malone , Charles , Patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to Michael.I 've seen it written that Gretchen Mol 's career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the 1998 Vanity Fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for Ms. Mol . It was later said that she had been over hyped . I disagree.I still remember that for some time after I saw " " The Devil 's Advocate " " in ' 97 or ' 98 , I would get confused as to which actress played Mary Ann Lomax . Was it Mol or Theron ? Oh yeah ! Charlize Theron was the one in " " 2 Days in the Valley " " and " " Mighty Joe Young " " and Gretchen Mol was in " " Donnie Brasco " , " " " Celebrity " , " and " " Rounders " . " By the time I had seen " " The Thirteenth Floor " " ( Mol ) and " " Sweet November " " ( Theron ) , I pretty much had them straightened out but I still put them in the same mental file drawer . Both were highly talented , had sweet faces , similar body types , short blonde hair and so on.Theron , though , was offered more work . I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating.In 2003 " " Monster " " was released and from that point until the handing of the Oscar itself , all of filmdom knew who the " " Best Actress " " award was going to . And deservedly so ! Theron was Aileen Wuornos . The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real Aileen Wuornos tick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in Selby 's head . And for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive ! Unheard of ! Then in 2005 " " The Notorious Bettie Page " " was released . Mol 's performance was extraordinary . Maybe she was standing in the shadow of Ms. Theron . It was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the losing Presidential candidate , nobody came and nobody cared . It was viewed as a continuation of an old tale , once promising actress with a declining career does a nudie part in a " " B " " movie . Ho hum ! No , no , no ! Wrong ! No matter what you may think of the film ( and I enjoy films about the fifties ) if you pass on this one you 'll be missing one of the better performances of that year . Ms. Moll was every bit as much Bettie as Ms. Theron was Aileen . Unfortunately Aileen , to the film-going public , is the more sympathetic character . For whatever reason , an amoral , sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a na챦ve , unsophisticated , uninhibited , religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed . Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties . Her photos and films never sexual , never pornographic , but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky . There was no sense of realism , only parody . Ms. Moll captured the very essence of the character . She gained 20 pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film , her body was Bettie 's . Her full frontal lack of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about Bettie . Cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism or sexuality . In this film it 's all about innocence . Seeing Gretchen / Bettie nude didn 't make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other . If you pass on this film you 'll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years . By the way , shame on the MPAA for giving this an R rating . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was really stunned how much a film , that 's over 60 years old could impress me . It is nearly two hours long , there are absolutely no stars in it , there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch . What impressed me mostly was the realism of the film . You could nearly feel the coldness of the ice , because you could see that the storms are real . This is a relief in a CGI-world like ourdays . I wondered how much work this must have been for van Dyke . I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it . Now who wants to talk about ' Titanic ' anymore ? It 's a great film with a great message and I would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I just viewed MURDER AT THE VANITIES in the newly-released Universal Pre-Code set , and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed the vehicle end to end . Most of the other commentators have covered the story , a murder mystery within a musical , but I wanted to add a few additional notes . Brisson and Carlisle are relatively bland , compared to even most of the minor players , and neither one really seems to have the proper voice for what they 're singing ( Carlisle being a trained opera singer , Brisson a bit wobbly on some of his high and low notes ) . The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well off each other , with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball rolling between musical numbers . Yes , Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanities girls , but let 's not forget the splendid jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the " " Ebony Rhapsody " " number . Gail Patrick makes one of her early appearances , sounding a bit like Eve Arden ; Patrick would go on to become the executive producer of the Perry Mason TV series . Then there 's Jessie Ralph as the wardrobe mistress--you 'll spot her also in David COPPERFIELD ( as Aunt Peggoty ) and THE BANK DICK . The music is very good--Brisson introducing the standard " " Cocktails for Two " " in two different scenes ; " " Sweet Marihuana " " with barely clad peyote button girls in the background ( blood dripping on one chorine 's white skin was wonderfully chilling ) ; the " " Ebony Rhapsody , " " with Duke Ellington 's Orchestra and a bevy of beautiful dancers , both black and white , mixing it up . And I believe this is one of the only early musicals to feature such a mix--and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil . The love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction . Two brothers , Andy and Hank , will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most.Andy Hanson ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) and his younger brother Hank ( Ethan Hawke ) couldn 't be more different . Andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in New York 's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife Gina ( Marisa Tomei ) who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed . Hank , however , is divorc챕e who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife , his daughter 's expensive school bills , and endless amount of child support payments . A man who means well and has good intentions , Hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it.However , Andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better . He has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears . The pressure of his life , and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up , have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with Gina in order to start over again . Of course , like Hank , he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it . How ? By robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run . This act of betrayal is where the Hanson brothers , their families , and several other lives , will be destroyed because of greed , pride , and fear . The uniqueness of Before The Devil Knows You 're Dead is the manner in which the story is told . After the robbery goes wrong , and Nanette Hanson ( Rosemary Harris ) who is the mother of both Andy and Hank is killed , the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt . We learn more about the motivations of not only Andy and Hank but also the reaction to their father Charles ( Albert Finney ) to the death of his wife . The relationship between Charles and his two sons , especially to Andy , is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men . Nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story.Philip Seymour Hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in Hollywood today by portraying Andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also , in contradictory way , as a man we can sympathize with . Ethan Hawke also brings Hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left . Andy and Hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions.Before The Devil Knows You 're Dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face . More than that , our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected . In what should have been best picture of the year , we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives . In other words , there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse.10 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie shocked me . It was so realistic and the story was incredible touching . They talk German and Russian , which makes it more believable and real . This is a must-see movie .

" " Wilder Napalm " " is the kind of theme-based movie that I love , addressing the idea that prodigies in America are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them .

In particular , deranged hunter Otis takes it personally . He follows the family to their vacation home , making sure they see him . He spies on George and Kim as they have sex . He fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren 't home , letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return . When Kim takes Miles to the drugstore in town , Miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case , carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag . A Native American man tells Miles that this is the Wendigo , a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry . Miles takes the figure home with him , already haunted by the death of the deer the day before . That afternoon , when he and his father go sledding , George is shot and Miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed ... or is he just in shock , and imagining the whole thing ? Hours later , George is rushed to the hospital and Miles , still clutching his statue , either faints , dreams or goes on a vision quest , in which the Wendigo returns . This time the angry , flesh eating god - part tree , part stag and part man - is hunting for Otis , who has finally gone over the edge.Wendigo is a beautifully made film , almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees . Okay , so the monster itself is kind of fakey-looking , but it 's a small flaw , more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film , and the eerie backdrop of the silent , snowy countryside . The performances are great , particularly by Jake Weber as the moody and thoughtful George and Patricia Clarkson as his sweet but no-nonsense wife . They are a happy couple with their share of common problems , and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful . Watching this film is often like watching someone 's home videos , so realistic are the performances . This movie is not for everyone . A lot of people may find themselves totally bored , waiting for the hideous Lovecraftian Beast and bloody revenge that never come . We can never really be sure if the Wendigo even exists , seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also , later , through the eyes of a madman . This is more a psychological drama than a horror film , but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My interpretation is that the term ' distant ' is used in the sense of the opposite of ' warm ' ; people who are not warm toward others . The film reminds me of the teachings of the Dalai Lama in ' The Art of Happiness ' where his main point is that the key to happiness is connecting with others . Not only are the characters in the film insular , but they are also humorless , charmless , shy , quiet and unfriendly . These characteristics appear to prevent them , amongst other things , from forming and enjoying relationships and being able to talk about and deal with their problems . And as a result they are terribly unhappy . I see it as a strong vindication of the Dalai Lama 's teaching ( I 'm not a Buddist by the way ) . If you are one of the people who thinks that their behavior is a natural response to living in a large city then I think you may be right but I recommend the Dalai Lama 's book . City life need not be like this.I can see why some people found it boring - it does drag a bit in places and the characters are not particularly likable . And it does contrast to Lost In Translation where the insular characters are much more likable and do connect with one another even though they don 't connect with people generally . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you 're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice . Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser . It 's an intellectual film , you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that . However , if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice . Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed . People who like Euro flicks will like this one . Adam Sandler fans should skip it because it will be over their heads and definitely NOT their style . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" To be completely honest , I completely intrigued by the original concept of ' Sleeper Cell . ' Having watched the best part of the series on FX Channel ( UK ) , my Sky got broke meaning I missed the crucial finale . But what I DID see of it , I assumed it to be a great story line , good acting and as I don 't watch ' 24 ' I thought it was great , AND it 's been confirmed for a second season ... One of the best TV programs I have seen . Much more realistic and believable than " " 24 . " " Excellent character development and plot line . Does not bash Islam , but gives a thoughtful and considered approach , showing the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam . Everybody should see this show !

" This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by Harriet Hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and / or shared between the principals . As usual the storyline needn 't detain us though for the record it was based on a play , Shore Leave , that also served as the basis for a Broadway Musical , Hit The Deck . Anyone who actually saw Shore Leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the movie but what matters , as always , is the music , lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle . It 's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1 ) we get to see Astaire play the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs , one of which , I 'm Building Up To An Awful Let-Down , had a lyric by Johnny Mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman , albeit an ex-hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner Ginger before the story starts . He gets to perform a little-known but excellent Berlin number , I 'd Rather Lead A Band as well as duetting on I 'm Putting All My Eggs In One Basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of World War II were already being felt - Let 's Face The Music And Dance , one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team . So what if Randolph Scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and Harriet Hilliard doesn 't exactly set the screen on fire ; we came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is , do they deliver . Answer : In spades . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well , I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan 's best film . The plot , the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent . In this film , Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui ( Kevin Chan in some versions ) who successfully arrested a crime lord . After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer . Due to this , he became wanted by the police . Later on , Salina ( Brigitte Lin ) , who was the secretary of the crime lord , went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord 's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to Chan . However , the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her . Later on , Chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen , defeating them one by one . At the last scene , Chan was seen punching the crime lord . Lastly , this is the best action and comedy movie . Everyone should watch it . Highly recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film has got to be ranked as one of the most disturbing and arresting films in years . It is one of the few films , perhaps the only one , that actually gave me shivers : not even Pasolini쨈s S찼lo , to which this film bears comparison , affected me like that . I saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like Pasolini , Fassbinder and others . I had to ask myself , what was it about the film that made me feel like I did ? I think the answer would be that I was watching a horror film , but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre . Typically , in a horror film , horrible and frightening things will happen , but on the margins of civilized society : abandoned houses , deserted hotels , castles , churchyards , morgues etc . This handling of the subject in horror is , I think , a sort of defence mechanism , a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desires and fears of the viewer . So , from this perspective , Hundstage is not a horror film ; it takes place in a perfectly normal society , and so doesn쨈t dabble in the histrionics of the horror film . But what you see is the displacement of certain key thematics from the horror genre , especially concerning the body and its violation , the stages of fright and torture it can be put through . What Seidl does is to use the settings of an everyday , middle class society as a stage on which is relayed a repetitious play of sexual aggression , loneliness , lack and violation of intimacy and integrity : precisely the themes you would find in horror , but subjected to a principle of light and transparency from which there is no escape . It is precisely within this displacement that the power of Seidl쨈s film resides . Hundstage deals with these matters as a function of the everyday , displays them in quotidian repetition , rather than as sites of extremity and catharsis - a move you would encounter in said horror genre . One important point of reference here is Rainer Werner Fassbinder . Fassbinder also had a way of blending the political with the personal in his films , a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism , domination , desire , questions concerning ownership , sexual property and control , fascism and capitalism etc . Seidl쨈s tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with Fassbinder ; like this German ally , he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films . During a seminar at the Gothenburg Film Festival this year , at which Seidl was a guest , he was asked why he would have so many instances of violated , subjugated women in Hundstage , but no instances of a woman fighting back , liberating herself . Seidl replied that some may view it as immoral to show violence against women , but that he himself felt it would be immoral not to show it . An artistic statement as good as any , I think . Thank you . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval . Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet , sometimes corny , but all the way sincere flick . He gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good , solid advice that holds true today about morals , decisions , the generation gap , teen dating , ( some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding . They sound like today 's stats ) . Just to see Billy in his younger days is worth seeing . It 's an awesome movie .

" One of my favorites . As a child , growing up in the NY Metro area in the late 60s and early 70s , I was often afforded the opportunity to visit NYC with my grandfather or father , as they conducted business there . The gritty , bustling , human , reality of that city , particularly in winter , have stayed with me . This film very aptly captures the stark , cold , matter-of-fact feel of the NYC winter season , while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region 's infamous underworld of crime and policing . A great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture . And the car chase is simply amazing . At least on par with the one in " " Bullitt " , " and surpassing the chase in " " The French Connection " . " I can watch , time and again , as the suspension comes unstuck on that Plymouth Fury police cruiser barreling toward the GW Bridge in pursuit , as it lurches into that sharp right curve , bouncing and scraping into oncoming traffic . The stunt driving coordinator for that scene did " " Bullitt " " and " " The French Connection " " as well as many other noatable movie chases . Good acting , too , and a decent plot line . The musical score is edgy and compelling , and the cinematography and direction are top notch . A great , if underrated 1970s cop drama . A keeper . Not out on DVD yet , though.Comparable in style and content to : The French Connection and Super Fly . Early 1970 's cop dramas set in the bleak NYC winter months . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film . After seeing it for the first time I 'm glad to say that it doesn 't disappoint . On the contrary , you get your time 's worth , which means ( as to what Miyazaki 's films are concern ) , that is nothing less than excellent ! Produced early in his cinematic career , Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies , with strong ( but young ) female characters , forced to grow up due to external circumstances , helped out by very interesting ( and some times lovable ) supporting characters . And , of course , the usual battle of nature versus civilization , flying machines ( lots of it ! ! ) , beautiful painted sceneries 혚 but alas , no pigs ( at least that i 've noticed , after all I have only seen it once ) . Never the less , Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier , with Nausic찾a , which was a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke , his magnum opus . Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two , with a soft action packed first 30 minutes , resembling his TV series Conan , and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes . In here we are introduced to Sheeta , a girl who literally falls from the sky , only to be found by Pazu , a young boy working in a little countryside mining town . Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa , Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from , whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates . As the movie progresses , the plot gets heavier and much more interesting , revealing Myiazaki at his best . The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away , ( or vice versa , as Castle in the sky was produced first ) , and much like its director , Joe Hisaishi _ the composer _ starts with a very light score , that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward ! A note to the English dubbing , with a good interpretation from the two lead stars , although Anna Paquin 's Sheeta has a very thick accent ( which the actress still had at that point in her career ) , and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska , making up for a delighting yet devilish villain ! Don 't miss this one people ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The number of times I 've had tears in my eyes when watching a movie are few . And there is only one time when I have really cried and that was when I saw this movie . This movie has some kliches but I really don 't care . I cry even as I write this and it was quite some time since I saw it . It is perfectly acted and all the production values are good , but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message . We all know it in our hearts , but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all it 's forms . It 's only when we love that we 're truly alive . I know how sentimental I sound and I promise I 'm not usually like that . I 'm quite a cynic .

" This movie is kind of good . It seem that they used the Tyrannosaurus Rex like a blown up balloon , just like Godzilla , just maybe back in those 60-70 's days , scientist haven 't got enough info. on all sorts of dinosaurs . Back in those time scientist still making dinosaur , so I guess this movie was base on a Tyrannosaurus Rex movements back in the 60-70 's . There even a part where a giant rock , fired by someone at the Tyrannosaurus Rex , it damage the Tyrannosaurus Rex and it was knock out for a little while . At the end , the Tyrannosaurus Rex went back to search for food . There is something wrong in the movie as well , like a rifle , how can one rifle kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex , when it could be 1,000-5,000 stronger than we are .

" The second ( not animated ) movie about the only people still refusing to surrender to the Roman Empire is even more hilarious than the first film " " Asterix & Obelix contre Ceasar " . " Where the first movie got all the laughs because all cartoon-characters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their cartoonesque identity , this sequel ( which is a separate story as are all the comic-books ) is even better . Sure , all the ingredients that you find in the first movie and in the comic-books are present again : Obelix is still dying to taste the " " magic potion " " that gives his other tribe members such enormous powers , Caesar and the rest of the Roman Empire are still enemy number 1 , but some new , refreshing elements have been brought to the stage as well.Not only is setting very idyllic ( biggest part plays of course in Egypt ) but rather than repeating movie number one , some extras have been added by making all kinds of references to other movies ( Bruce Lee etc . ) . This is all not very new , but the unexpected combination of the known story from the comic-book ( with almost the same title as the movie ) and references to stuff that has got absolutely nothing to do with Asterix & Obelix really works.In that way the movie builds further on a tradition by comic-writers Goscinny and Uderzo who didn 't hesitate to bring Laurel and Hardy on the stage and even dedicate an entire story to Kirk Douglas.If all of this doesn 't convince you to watch this movie , I 'm sure Monica Bellucci playing Cleopatra will .... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The most special effects are also beautiful , although some are really fake ( like a drilled-out tongue , that has laid for 1 night outside , and is still red in the morning ) .

" This is a story about Shin-ae , who moves to Milyang from Seoul with her young son Jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband . Her husband was born here , and she is opening up a piano school , but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death . If that is what the film was about , it probably would have been like a Hollywood film , with her falling for some local guy and being happy with her son in their new home . But , this is not Hollywood . Her son gets kidnapped and murdered , ostensibly because it is known she has cash from the settlement . The grief process , attempts at moving on , attempts to clear her conscience of guilt , are all done admirably , and the lead actress is superb . The only caveat , and it has to be stated , is that this is a depressing film . You have to know that going in . You want Shin-ae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness . Again , this is not Hollywood , it is Korea and in Korean cinema , especially drama , they pull no punches . Life is what happens to you . Great acting , but sometimes a tough film to watch , due to the goings on . If you stay , you 'll be rewarded . Do that . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Shame is rather unique as a war film ( or rather quite the anti-war film ) in that it not only doesn 't focus on the soldiers or politics involved ( there is politics but not how you 'd think it 'd be shown ) , it deals with its two main subjects as the only two beings that can possibly be cared about at all in this brutal , decaying society they inhabit . Ingmar Bergman , in the midst of his prime , and following two other heavily psychological films , Persona and Hour of the Wolf , is far more interested in seeing what the effect of war has on usually civilized beings , that it brings out the worst in them , and also in a cathartic way is a reminder of what is truly crucial in living . His two key actors are frequent collaborators and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman ( as the Rosenbergs oddly enough ) , who are musicians living on a farm on an island ( not too dissimilar from ' Wolf ' when one thinks about it ) .They see the tanks roll by , and a couple of old friends already getting worn down , but they try not to put it too much to heart ; there 's a sweet scene where the couple just talk , rather frankly but with heart ( all one shot , as is repeated through the film is to perhaps create a sense of being provoked ) ... Then comes the trouble , including a fake film of propaganda made at gunpoint with the Rosenbergs , the psychological turmoil in being prisoners of war , and the terror involved with a ' friend ' in the military ( one of Gunnar Bjornstrand 's most subtle works with Bergman ) . Needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of Bergman 's filmography , however for some it may be one of his more accessible works . His religious themes this time is kept very low key , even as the idea of keeping a sort of faith pervades the film 's atmosphere . When there is war action it 's shot in unconventional , quick ways ( via great amigo Sven Nykvist ) .And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eva is corresponded successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of war-ground where the lines are never too surely drawn . In a way this film , shot right at the height of the worst times in Vietnam , is even more relevant for today ; I couldn 't help but see chilling , uncompromising coincidences between Iraq and elsewhere with some of Jan and Eva 's scenes with the fighters , or those ' in charge ' . The very last scene , by the way , is one of Bergman 's very best , all around ( acting , directing , lighting ) . It 's not the kind of war picture ( or , again , anti-war , I find little of the John Wayne spirit in this Svensk production ) that I would recommend right off the bat to my friends all into Saving Private Ryan- it has a little more in kinship with Paths of Glory , looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war . But in reality , like any of Bergman 's " " genre " " films , it stands alone , however one that packs a wallop for the art-house crowd . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Footprints certainly isn 't your average run of the mill Giallo , and that 's no bad thing . Unlike his previous effort , The Fifth Cord ( which was your ' classic ' Giallo ) Luigi Bazzoni 's film forsakes almost all of the Giallo trademarks and instead of murder ; the focus is very on psychological mystery . It 's obvious from the outset that this is going to be an entirely bizarre film as the film opens up with a scene set on the moon . Things don 't get any clearer after that as the lunar sequence turns out to be the dream of Alice , a troubled woman . Alice is tormented by dreams of an astronaut stranded on the moon , which have apparently come from a viewing of a film called ' Footprints on the Moon ' . After several things go wrong for her , Alice decides to go to a mostly deserted former tourist spot named Garma . Upon her arrival , she is surprised as the people she meets seem to already know her . Alice also meets a young red headed girl who also seems to already know her ; the girl tells Alice she looks exactly like Nicole , except nicer and with shorter hair ... The fact that Footprints doesn 't feature much in the way of sex , murder and other Giallo trademarks puts it somewhat on the back foot with it 's primary audience from the beginning as most people going into this film aren 't going to get what they were expecting ( or , probably , wanted ) . But on the other hand , Footprints commands respect for the fact that it doesn 't just follow on from what went before it . By 1975 , the Giallo had started to lose it 's popularity and many of the films coming out around this period ( with a few very notable exceptions ) were merely retreads of what came before , so Luigi Bazzoni would have been taking a big chance on this film . Florinda Bolkan gives a strong performance in the lead role ; and the fact that she 's not the prettiest Giallo heroine isn 't really important . The mystery builds nicely throughout , and while it can become a little turgid at times ; Footprints is , generally speaking , intriguing for the duration . It probably won 't come as a surprise to many once they get there that the ending doesn 't make much sense , and doesn 't really clear anything up ; but it nicely adds to the bizarre cult value of the film , and all in all ; I give Footprints a thumbs up ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

... " this one . What came to my mind immediately was Loving Annabelle , as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject . We simply observe as the story unfolds , without taking sides , or having to confront any " " moral " " issues ( or of course we are , but are not spoon-fed them ) . Sure , there were some difficult facts to face , and choices to make , but it just flowed . Basically it was just like any other love story , in any other life , with any other sexes.I personally found the girls having a good chemistry , and had fun with them on their night outs . The only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind of ... retained . Held back . It 's not about the sex scenes ( or those missing ) , but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time , it kind of contrasted with the rest . Lowkey is good , but it just never quite sizzled like Loving Annabelle , nor touched me quite as much.This said , i heartily recommend it , it 's by no means a waste of ones precious time , on the contrary ... 7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" October Sky is a highly lauded movie , and it징짝s easy to see why . The story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping , the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs , especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper , the hero finally gets what he wants , and it징짝s a true story . Frankly I think the director징짝s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates . We don징짝t see any special narrative or cinematography ; the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters . We feel Homer징짝s desire to earn his father징짝s recognition and create his own future , and his resilience wins our respect . 징짠October Sky징짢 reminds me of a later 2001 Japanese production of mini series 징짠Rocket Boy , 징짢 which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie . Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison . When October Sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny , 징짠Rocket Boy징짢 offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society . Starring the outstanding actor Yuji Oda , 징짠Rocket Boy징짢 focuses on three men as ordinary as can be : a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut , a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother ( like what Homer feels in his family ) , and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea . The collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them 징짠impossible.징짢 To compensate for his lost ideal , Kobayashi ( Yuji ) works in the tour operator because it징짝s called 징짠Galaxy.징짢 When his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him , he finally finds strength from his father징짝s words , who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed . 징짠But I don징짝t regret it , 징짢 his father told Kobayashi , 징짠at least I tried.징짢 It is his father징짝s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair . Kobayashi징짝s effort finally fails , and he goes back to the travel agency . But his 징짠crazy징짢 courage inspires his friends , and everyone loves him more . Just before the end of the series , Kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts . After the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree , unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says : 징짠Astronauts Wanted for 2004.징짢 Kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs , just like a kid looking at his ticket to Disneyland . Kobayashi may never get what he wants , but he dares his destiny and 징짠just does it.징짢 This series is so heart-gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds , but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy . Unlike Dilbert or other sarcastic writings , this show enlightens us and teaches us something . Homer and Kobayashi both have the dream , and they do what they can despite other people징짝s opinions . I recommend other IMDB users to see the Japanese TV series . If you are a nine-to-fiver , you will feel more touched . I feel sorry that IMDB doesn징짝t have its data , maybe you can ask somebody from Japan to help you . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well I gave this movie a 7 . It was better than " " Thirdspace " " but not as good as " " In the Beginning " " as far as the B5 movies go . I really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal . Let 's hope the producers and cast get the next series " " Crusade " " up to the standards of B5 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Though structured totally different from the book by Tim Krabb챕 who wrote the original ' The Vanishing ' ( Spoorloos ) it does have the same overall feel , except for that Koolhoven 's style is less business-like and more lyric . The beginning is great , the middle is fine , but the sting is in the end . A surprise emotional ending . As you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film , but it is done all very beautifully . Never explicit , but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour . It is a shame American films can 't be as open an honoust as this one . Where Dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject , ' De Grot ' stays always within the boundaries of good taste . ' De Grot ' tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years . When you 'll leave the cinema you 'll be moved . What can we ask more of a film ? Anyway , this film even gives more .... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the first James Cagney film I have ever really watched . I was never interested in his movies before because I figured I wouldn 't like anything in that style of cinema and because I 've heard most Cagney films are the same . I have to say I really liked it . By today 's standards for movies , it was not special , but I found it surprisingly entertaining . Cagney did not have the look of a tough guy but he played the part very well . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is unfortunately Carlin 's last recorded HBO concert , from a series that lasted over 30 years . Though this may not be his " " best " " work , it is excellent , funny , and thought provoking . This recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit lengthier than most of his other concerts.Throughout his long , prolific , and influential career , Carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes , towards a more ' humanitarian ' viewpoint of society and culture . His focus on the English Language and euphemisms increased throughout the years , and culminates in this performance . Though , I would argue that his audio book " " When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops ? " " best displays his vast wit with regards to language , euphemisms , and the breakdown of our values . It 's Bad For Ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer.If you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church , you will probably not like any of Carlin 's stand up material . However , if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy , you would probably greatly enjoy this concert . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing , this is the main pleasure I took from the beautifully shot " " Thirst " " - laughter . Although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn 't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy , the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals . It helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful , and that I was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady , who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became.I read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong . I didn 't think so . In fact the last scenes , moving and hilarious ( I mean , the brown shoes .... ) by turns , were among the best in the film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Paul Verhoeven ( genius and master film maker ) strikes back with the less than perfect , yet still fun in a " " dirty old man type of way , " " Hollow Man . The first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints . Yet I am giving a recommendation to this film for it 's MIND BLOWING special effects ( perhaps the best so far around ) and two dandy performances by the leads . Verhoeven 's moral questions are of course thought provoking , and although the film turned off many , this movie is pretty soft-core for old Verhoeven.Two major flaws : Josh Brolin ( aka walking ape-man ) and the whole deal with the elevator . If there was an access ladder , why were they trapped down in the lab ? A fun horror film for a Saturday night . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Not only do the storylines in " " The Sopranos " " engage audiences from all over , but I think ( for me at least ) what brings the viewers back is the acting . ( Not even you , Gary , can dispute that claim ) James Gandolfini , who plays the lead-man , Tony Soprano , has become ( in this viewer 's opinion ) one of the " " Hollywood Elites " " as far as acting in a television series goes . I wouldn 't go ahead and compare him with Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino , or at least , not just yet . He , however , does do a hell of a job playing the part of Tony Soprano . In the years since 1999 , Gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor ( mainly thanks to his role in The Sopranos ) that today he is considered to be among the best in the business . And it 's not just him . " " The Sopranos " " fields a great supporting cast including that of Lorraine Bracco , Edie Falco , Michael Imperioli , Dominic Chianese , and the late Nancy Marchand who played Tony 's dreadful mother . At this point in the show 's existence , it 's being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so . The first two seasons were extraordinary . Violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner , but without a doubt , extraordinarily done . The third season was great , but didn 't quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2 . Season 4 , which wrapped up right before new-years , was the weakest season yet ( or at least , in my opinion it was ) . Despite a dry-spell , I still found it ( season 4 of " " The Sopranos " " ) to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that 's saying a lot because lately I 've been noticing a trend in good new television shows . Examples of this : Six Feet Under , The Shield , Curb Your Enthusiasm , and OZ ( which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year ) . To get back to my point though , to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year , no less , is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers . " " The Sopranos " " ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit . To close , I 'd like to say , " " The Sopranos " " is the real deal folks . For the average mature viewer ( 17 and above ) who enjoys drama and doesn 't mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity , you might want to check out " " The Sopranos " " if you get the chance . Trust me in that it will be well worth the time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary " " Earth " " ? How much time do you have on earth so I can explain this to you ? OK , I will not elongate my review exploration on " " Earth " " to infinity , but I must stand my ground on why this is a " " must see " . " The documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families : a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path , a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey , and an elephant mama with her small ( maybe not so small , they are elephants ) offspring migrating in Africa . Directors Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield did an " " out of this earth " " job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists . The cinematographically skilled team of Richard Brooks Burton , Mike Holding , Adam Ravetch , and Andrew Shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors ; not to mention , the slo-mo animal prey shots were u n b e l i e a v a b l e . " " Earth " " is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals ; the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence . So fellow earthlings , it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit " " Earth " " today ! * * * * Good , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared ( when all they make you do is walk out of the theater ) and movies that just shouldn 't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn 't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it ( but her death scene makes up for it , believe me ) .... so here they are .. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie .. 1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton 's ! after finding her boyfriend Blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck , Paige starts to run. well , speed walk is more respectable. she finds this like garage with all these cars in it. then ( one of ) the killers cuts her ankle from below ( this whole time shes holding a HUGE metal spike ) so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car. the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead .. I 've NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED OR LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE.2. Paige 's boyfriend Blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him ( while hes on the ground ) and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat .. then he dies.3. Elisha cuthbert ( carly ) ( one of the hottest chicks EVER ) doesn 't die PHEW but she does get her lips super-glued together , punched in the face , and gets part of her index finger chopped off ( yeah , i felt like heaving ) 4 . Carly 's twin brother nick also survives , but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg.5. nicks best friend Dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs , and then is decapitated. his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink .. then he gets covered in wax.6. wade ( Carly 's boyfriend ) gets his Achilles tendon snipped by a massive pair of scissors , and then is attacked by the same scissors. he doesn 't die , but hes covered in wax , and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed , revealing his nasty bloody flesh .

" " " The Woman in Black " " is easily one of the creepiest British ghost stories ever made.A young solicitor , after arriving in a small town to handle a dead client 's estate , is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed all in black.The film is loaded with extremely eerie atmosphere and the frights are calculated for and deliver the maximum effect possible.The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite disturbing.The acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times.So if you want to see a truly creepy horror film give this one a look.I dare anyone to watch " " The Woman in Black " " alone at night with the lights off.Highly recommended.10 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
14 years since this show was made and it is still is the best show ever made . The writing was 1st class and the production second to none . This show would never be made today and that this a shame . I hope if you are thinking about finding this show to watch that you do . AG came out the year I left high school at the time my fav TV show was the x files this gives you an idea of why I first got into this show . AG was a far better program with better writing but only got one reason ? I know this is not the only program to only get one season another example that comes to mind would be the lone gunman ( x files spin off ) it had good writing and was funny but also only got one season . It does not seem right ! We also have to remember that this show was around before shows like twilight made dark shows ' cool ' so I think this may have also let to the show going down hill .

" It 's probably a year since I saw Uzak , but it has left strong memories of the two main characters , jaded photographer Mahmut and his naive cousin from the village Yusuf.It 's a long film with very little dialogue and a quite limited plot . This has evidently annoyed a fair few viewers . But the film constructs such a painfully believable portrait of Mahmut and Yusuf that there 's just as much emotional tension as in the paciest thriller.Just to be clear , there 's no padding in this film -- in the long pauses where no one speaks there as much happening in the characters ' emotions ( and in yours , watching them ) as you could bear . Go to see it awake and alert , and you 'll be gripped rather than anaesthetised.Uzak rings true in so many ways , and that sincerity is probably its greatest accomplishment . People don 't grapple with events and problems , so much as with each other . In fact , in the whole film , there 's probably not one point where the main characters ( Mahmut , Yusuf and Mahmut 's ex-wife Nazan ) are not opposed.Much of it is true the world over : country cousin Yusuf 's perhaps wilfully naive expectation that a job on a ship will drop into his lap ; Mahmut 's urbanised cynicism and unwillingness to sympathise with Yusuf.Other truths are more-specific to Turkey : Yusuf 's incomprehension that Mahmut might be tolerating his stay with gritted teeth ; Yusuf veering between macho ambition and wide-eyed awkwardness when he tries to get to know a woman.Uzak is undoubtedly a pretty bleak film , and one Ceylan 's strengths is not to beat us over the head with the themes he explores . For me at least , I believed entirely in the behaviour of his characters . All the little failed attempts to connect and petty cruelties ring so true . And yet I didn 't leave with a message that " " The world is like that " , " but instead I got " " This is how we sometimes treat each other . " " , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Haven 't played the game ? Don 't bother . This is for the Final Fantasy VII fans out there that beat the game , and no other will appreciate this rare gem of a movie . Want to watch it and love it ? Buy the game , beat it and then watch it . When 's the last time you 've seen an excellent movie based on a video game ? Well , this is it.The story takes place two years after the game and no short summaries are given to refresh your memory ( though I doubt many would forget ) , and goes right into the one hour and forty-one minute adventure.All your favorite characters are there , even Cait Sith . The voice acting is superb in the Japanese version , every character is cast perfectly . Cloud sounds tough and broody , Tifa sounds kind yet strong ... Aeris is also perfect , she sounds exactly as I imagined . Cait Sith sounds less cute than I imagined , but worked very well.The character models are spectacular , great textures and lighting . The environments are breathtaking and the battles are choreographed in a way to make The Matrix blush . The amazing camera work comes through in the bike chases , for example , where your eyes are just screaming in satisfaction and your lungs breathing heavily without consent.The music is typical Uematsu quality , which means its top notch . Familiar tunes are remade to accompany Advent Children 's graphical leap , which meshes with the visual aspects very well . There 's even an inside joke for the fans that involves music , it 'll make you smile for sure.I did not watch it with subtitles since I 'm half-Japanese so I can 't say that the subtitles are any good . In Japanese , however , the dialogue is very good and every word sounds like it 's coming from real living beings , not just actors . Impressive . I 'll watch this again someday with subtitles to see the differences since I 've played both the Japanese and American release of Final Fantasy VII.If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII , buy this movie the day it comes out or pre-order it . If you haven 't played the game but want to see this movie very badly , don 't waste your time : buy the game , beat it , and then come back for this DVD . I won 't tell you to not watch it , but play the game . It 'll make the experience a lot better and won 't leave you in the dust scratching your heads.Come back , old friends - it 's time to go on an adventure again with your brave comrades ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Of all Arnold 's mid- ' 80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man . A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad . It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now . Not when you think about it . Currently , Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar . If the next one isn 't more controversial as the last , it 's a dud . How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man ? How long before we have ' court-appointed theatrical attorneys ' or the entertainment division of the Justice Department ? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows.The biggest message of all is ' You are being lied to ' . It 's no secret that the Government and the media work in cahoots . And the masses believe what the media tells them to believe . It 's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the Running Man in the near future . It 's no secret that Reality TV is not very realistic . It 's edited and reshaped before being aired and it 's only what the networks want you to see . Usually it 's far from the real truth.Although rather different than Stephen King 's book ( the ending is completely changed ) the script does conform to the typical Arnie formula . Yes , he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say ' I 'll be back ' ( which he never REALLY said that often anyway , when you think about it ) in the most ironic situation yet but he 's still a zillion times better in the role then Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren would have been ( these two were considered BEFORE Arnie believe it or not ) .The director is none other than Dave Starsky himself ( Paul Michael Glaser ) . It may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look . Andrew Davis ( not a director I particularly like ) was attached before Glaser , though no matter who directs , the film is still marred by a very heavy 80 's feel.First of all , Harold Faltermeyer 's score ( remember him ? ) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity . And the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future . Apart from the dated feel , the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.This new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release . Gone is the horrid letterbox picture . In its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85 : 1 anamorphic transfer . The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen . The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing . There constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful . Definitely one of the best re-masters I 've seen so far . Two intriguing documentaries , a trailer and a ' Meet the Stalkers ' gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Basically , this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do , rather than having to sit through it for two hours .

The fact that U have to find the things mentioned above , actually makes the movie even more funny , because u get the impression the director isn 't even aware of how funny his movie is , which doesn 't seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called : Spaced Invaders ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I want to state first that I am a Christian ( and that I do work in the film and TV industry ) so I understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard . I 'm all for positive , uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life ( that this is a fallen world and that things don 't always work out ... even for followers of Christ ) . I 'm glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt Christian message ; for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face . A movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes , exposition aplenty , and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least . I believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across . I 'm sure the Kendrick bros. will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well . Maybe they could direct someone else 's screenplay as their next project . * Sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one ( Hoosiers , Field of Dreams , etc ) can inspire in a multitude of ways . If you would be interested in a PG-rated film that inspires , give Steven Soderbergh 's ' King of the Hill ' a look . All truth is God 's truth ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " The Shop Around the Corner " " is one of the great films from director Ernst Lubitsch . In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan , it 's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart .They 're the type of character actors that Hollywood sadly no longer employs . In fact , the film itself is the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn 't make anymore . ( The makers of " " You 've Got Mail " " claim their film to be a remake , but that 's just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise . ) Anyway , if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940 's , you 'll find " " The Shop Around the Corner " " to be nothing short of wonderful .

" Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down . His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that will never be matched . Earth : The Final Conflict was proof ! His pilot film and the first 2 Seasons were well written and meticulously produced , but somewhere along the way the Roddenberry touch was lost . The loss of lead , Kevin Kilner ( William Boone ) definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work . The story involves the human race being visited by the Taelons , an extra-terrestrial race who dub themselves ' The Companions ' . After 3 years they have given earth new technologies , helpful information about the Universe and more . Many question their intentions here on Earth . The main liaison on Earth between the races is Da 'an ( Leni Parker ) and he is to many , the most trustworthy Taelon . Questions arise : just why are they here ? what are their goals , is Da 'an aware of any suspected plots against the humans ? There is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist Jonathan Doors ( David Hemblen ) who utilizes his millions to investigate the Taelons . By the end of the First Season things are going well , Da 'an seems trustworthy , Boone assists Doors in his investigation while working with Da 'an and the Taelons as a liaison . In the middle of the 2nd Season things start unraveling and the once terrific and fascinating series spirals downward , mostly because Roddenberry had died and was not around to guide the producers , of whom his wife Majel Barrett-Roddenberry was co-producer . Still , the first Season remains intriguing and fun to watch . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I won 't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is . I 'll just state my opinion . OK , I really liked the script , the way things are told and characters are introduced . However , I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen , it could maybe try and fit this other media . Since this movie was directed by Jo찾o Falc찾o , the same man who directed the play , it 's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical . It 's the man 's first movie , for cryin ' out-loud ! What I 'm saying is , there are parts in the film - like the city of Nordestina , which slightly resembles the set of " " Hoje 챕 Dia de Maria " " - that feel like we 're not at a movie theater . We 're at the theater ! Lines are spoken too formally , characters are moving choreographically , and the lightening is clearly meant for a stage . Sure , maybe that was the intention , but that 's been done . On stage . Wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie - the beautiful " " Closer " , " for instance .

" Director / writer Michael Winner 's feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film ( although still schlock efficiently catered for ) , which really does by go unnoticed . Sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period , but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material ( of good vs. evil ) and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive , if somewhat exploitative set-pieces . As a whole it 's sketchy , however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang-busters with the scares . Actually there 's always something going on amongst its busy framework , but it 's rather down-played with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring , up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation . Winner 's dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian , however it 's the ensemble cast that really holds it together혚 as you try to spot the faces . There 's plenty too . Some having more to do with the scheme of things than others , but there 's no doubts every one of them are committed , despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all . It 's interesting to see names like Sylvia Miles ( who 's significantly creepy ! ) , Beverly D 'Angelo ( likewise ) , Deborah Raffin , Eli Wallach , Christopher Walken , William Hickey ( a neat cameo ) , Jeff Goldblum , Jerry Orbach and Tom Berenger in bit parts . Then you got a mild-mannered Chris Sarandon and movingly gorgeous Cristina Raines in the leads . Offering able support Jos챕 Ferrer , Martin Balsam , Ava Gardner , John Carradine , Burgess Meredith and Arthur Kennedy . The script does throw around many characters , as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in . However it 's disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what 's really going on here . Is there a reason for all of this , and why is it surrounding Raines ' character ? The emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle , as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange / worrying experiences she encounters when she 's moves into her new apartment . This is where Winner tries to pull out the eerie shades , which projects some icy moments . Gil Melle was the man responsible for the grand , overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and Richard C. Kratina instruments the sweeping , scope-like photography . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've seen this film in avant-premiere at Imagina Festival in Monaco.I saw the first trailer four years ago , and from this moment , I was waiting to see the final result . I haven 't been disappointed.It is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render . Clearly inspired by some comic books , such as the ones from F. Miller . In this optic , it goes one step further than the excellent " " Sin City " " adaptation from R. Rodriguez . This time , ( almost ) no Grey or any middle color , but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film . ( can 't wait for scanner darkly ) The massive use of Motion Capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements , such as direction or plot . The direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium , and that is a really good surprise.The futuristic story ( Paris 2053 ) makes it a classic sci-fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end . Despite a classic base plot ( an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations ) the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes ( genetics , absolute power of certain firms ... ) gives this movie a great interest.Despite it is an animated film , this one is obviously not made for children . You won 't find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral , only the cold reality . It is far closer to a good film noir.I found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film : we still feel the well known Paris , but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurism.Nevertheless , I regret a few mistakes . The montage is sometimes a bit flat , one or two very clich챕 slow motion effects and some poor dialogs . Even though the technical is excellent , it shows its limits in some romantic sequences ( a bit like " " final fantasy " " did ) . Those little things makes it a 7 / 10.Altogether , it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can . The director , Christian Volckman , knows how not to fall into potential traps ( luckyly , they didn 't ask John Woo to do the job ! ) .To conclude , it is a film with blasting visuals , an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction . Watch it if you can ! Please excuse me for the spelling mistakes . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I really like the movie 's opening , when Col. Ted Masters realizes on his fighter radar that four enemy aircraft were approaching from about 10 o 'clock . The good news is that the movie does not mention at the very beginning that the colonel , along with a wingman fighter who was a lieutenant , was trying to do a " " freedom of navigation " " exercise along the eastern Meditteranean Sea , but went a little too past the restricted air space zone reserved for a rogue Middle eastern nation as they accidentially fly past it.I also like all of the intercutting on the colonel 's fighter radar readouts and computer displays as the enemy aircraft aggressively picks the two American fighter pilots into an engagement for violating their airspace . That first dogfight immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot movie , " " Top Gun . " " From the waxing of the enemy bandits to the enemy aircraft 's thirty-milimeter rounds that struck the colonel 's jet engines and forcing the plane down , forcing him to eject , all of this reminds us of one thing ... dogfight fighter techniques can keep you alive ... but one false move can cause you to be shot down.The only problem in the movie was the " " snake sequence " " scene . It was a little bit too long . Yes , the movie 's opening was great when you see the conflict ... which was the dogfight engagement . Only when one boy tells Doug Masters that his father was shot down after the Cessna planes landed in the " " snake " " race , forces us back to the time the conflict already started . I guess the snake sequence in the middle should be interrupted a little bit by Col. Masters being dragged in handcuffs in the middle of the Bilyad desert on his way to the detention center ... while the music sequence for the " " snake " " continues . The film does not do it ... if it were , the conflict 's details would have been smoother at that point . Still good otherwise.When word found out that Col. Ted Masters trial for high treason ( violating territorial air sovereignty ) was over and he was condemned to be hung on the gallows in three days , Doug Masters decides to go into action . With the Air Force having futile attempts to save the man , Doug decides to pull his friends and Col. Sinclair ( played by Louis Gossett Jr . ) for a plan to rescue Masters . Risking a high chance of facing a court martial and spending more than a year in a military stockade , he goes against Air Force policy and makes a plan to rescue Masters without consent of the U.S. government.Doug and his friends sneak into several classified areas of the base to get plenty of stuff on the area where Masters is held for the upcoming hanging , and the surrounding area around Bilyad ( which turns out to be a fake Middle Eastern country for the movie ) . One plan included shooting off firecrackers outside the Air Force darkroom area as a diversion to get classified photos and maintenance stuff on the fighter aircraft , fighter base , intelligence , and all of the other military stuff around Bilyad . When all was said and done , and Sinclair studied all of the intelligence , he almost rebuffed at that plan because Doug was way too cocky . Not until they get the two F-16 planes and tried a dry run across a firing range that I realized what they were going to do overseas . I realized that Doug 's fighter shooting and bomb dropping is not good until he hears rock music . I can remember when he dropped one Mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb missed by 20 feet .... I realized that Doug is unusual . He likes music when he fires the fighter ammunition.The last part of the conflict , the final dogfight action in " " Iron Eagle " " was better than Top Gun 's climax of the hostile dogfight sequences . I liked the way the final conflict unfolded , especially when Doug Masters faces off with an Middle-Eastern ace fighter pilot who actually ran the trial against Ted Masters . Short but sweet when Doug took the enemy fighter out after a second try by a side-winder missile . Looks like this Bilyad colonel was akin to " " Darth Vader " " in Star Wars .... in the air , he can be very evil , because if you have seen Star Wars , Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker , who was an ace pilot in space . Unusual connotation for this but still works ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" It 's quite revealing to see this today and appreciate how far we 've come along in what we expect from movies , and at the same time appreciate how many bedrock notions were established.Here we have a full-fledged narrative talking film - the audio and the visuals are pushed to their period limits . The framing is limited to about belt-high and up -- no face close-ups . The compositions are remarkable ; there 's an early over-the-shoulder cross cutting scene to showcase the dialogue ; there 's a treacherous descent into a canyon with some harrowing perspective angles ; a sun-bleached skeleton lies in the dust as the wheels and legs march in the upper portion of the frame ; the tension in the showdown between the hero and the bad guy is visually captured by filming above the long axis of a large tree that lies between them ; and on and on - early visual treats abound.Today , it 's unsettling to see the young Wayne carry a film , unencumbered by ego or mannerisms.I have to wonder if Walsh recognized the self-reference : the subject is the journey of a disparate group of pilgrims ; those who appear on screen are a disparate group of stage actors , vaudeville comedians , shell game artists , and , probably , carny barkers and ten-in-one show veterans . They all journey together to blaze a trail for how movies would be made.This is worth at least one viewing to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later movies . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Let me start by saying that Liev has gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his directorial debut " " Everything Is Illuminated " . " Anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with nonsensical and hilarious vocabulary by Alex along with countless flashback scenes and crazy dreamlike sequences . Liev took all of this and made it work . The movie itself is great - the soundtrack , the performances , the cinematography - it all works . There is a lot of story missing about the town and its inhabitants , but there 's only so much you can do with an indie , so this part of it didn 't bother me too much . It 's just disappointing that not a lot of people will see this movie or even know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that came with it . I didn 't even know it was in theatres . I didn 't know when the DVD came out . You 'd think that since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters , SOMEBODY wouldve at least released a commercial for it . I had to see the trailer on my " " Paradise Now " " DVD ( released on DVD in the Spring of ' 06 ) to even know that it had a " " Fall of 2005 " " theatrical release date .

" Reading the various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I love this movie , even though I only have a dubbed-into-Japanese video version of it.Apparently , many critics seem to take it as a minus that the story premise has been used before , most famously in the very great " " It 's a Wonderful Life . " " To me , a great premise is a great premise no matter how many times it 's used , and I 'd be happy to see more movies using this particular premise--the discontented man who gets a chance to gain a fresh perspective on his own life through a bit of " " divine magic . " " I suppose folks and critics of a more intellectual bent are not as pulled into the story , but I don 't go to movies to critique them with notebook in hand--I go to movies to throw myself into them and let them take me where they will . If you are sentimental sort like myself , you 'll be well rewarded by seeing this picture . The performances are excellent throughout , and the movie was very well cast . Wonderful choice of music , too . Michael Caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender . Jim Belushi does a great job as an " " average Joe " " kind of guy who wonders if his life hasn 't gone as it should . Linda Hamilton , always excellent , is again right on target here as the loving wife . Jon Lovitz entertains as usual , and even has some surprisingly moving moments in " " Mr. Destiny .

" One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears , and here he gets a rare lead as the title character . Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west . John Ford 's stock of character actors , including Harry Carey , Jr . , Jane Darwell , Russell Simpson and Hank Worden , provide ample support , as does eerily silent James Arness , a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train . The Mormon trail into Utah was one of the most arduous and demanding enterprises ever undertaken . We can 't really get the feel of that , but we do see ordeals that had to be overcome by pioneers on the way west ; river crossings , long stretches of dry , waterless desert , encounters with Indians and the like , all set to glorious song by the Sons of the Pioneers . The Mormons actually did dig sections of the trail with picks and shovels , as depicted in the movie . My main regret is that it wasn 't made in color , but I believe there is a colorized version . By the way , those craggy rocks featured in various scenes are called the Fisher Towers , located near Moab . Highly recommended viewing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" for a slasher flick , this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre.yes it is predictable-resident nut job goes on killing spree , people die , yada yada yada.however there are some good positives in this film.first off , i really liked the mask the nut job wore.it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique ( although i haven 't watched every single slasher film ever made ) also , the genesis of the bad due is something i haven 't seen before , and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept , as far as i know.i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by Mr sicko , for most of the murders.the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre , but that 'a small concern.the movie does not take itself seriously , which is something most slashers suffer from.oddly enough , while watching the movie , i was reminded of the early " " Friday the 13th films , which did take themselves seriously.there are a few concerns about this movie.in several scenes , the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons.by this , i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot , and also the way he walked.of bigger concern , however is a scene very close to the end , where Mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance ( actually a complete rip off ) of another famous horror titan.and in the very last scenes , we have our scumbag , once again , looking exactly like the 1st horror icon i mentioned.in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip-off from another icon in the slasher genre. these scenes were weak and unoriginal ( obviously ) .by the way , the movie is set in Australia , so if you 're a sucker for a chick with an Aussie accent ( like me ) you 'll be in heaven.if you not , than it just might grate on you.one other great thing about this movie : beautiful Kylie Minogoue ( just don 't get too attached to her ) there is one non Aussie accent , courtesy of Molly Ringwald.overall , there are more reasons to watch than not.i enjoyed it and had some fun.so , i have to give " " Cut " " 8 / 10 , which may seem too high to some people . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Babette 's Feast " " and " " The Horse 's Mouth " " are the two most insightful , accurate films on what it is to be a real artist . The key lines in " " Babette 's Feast " " are not , as some other commentators here have said , " " an artist is never poor , " " but two lines that come before and after it : " " I was able to make them happy when I gave of my very best . ... Throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist : give me the chance to do my very best . " " I spent nine years producing experimental multi-media music theater in San Francisco , raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers , actors , designers , etc . , and the artists I supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best . They were just like Babette : they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work . Babette 's art is fine French cooking , and for her to perform her art at its very best costs 10,000 francs . When , after years in political exile from France , isolated with two caring spinsters on a bleak Scandinavian coast , she suddenly gets a windfall of 10,000 francs , she does what every real artist would do : she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best , and so she does it . She spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist . The twist in the movie is that we don 't know she is such an artist , until she is actually cooking and serving the meal . Up until then , she appears to be just a working-class French lady who haggles a bit with the tradesmen , and is very serious ( her husband and son were murdered in Paris violence in 1871 ) . To such an artist , it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it . That is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving . Babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two spinsters , or to the religious community . It was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious sect . Indeed , she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them . After the meal , she is sitting alone , sipping some wine , not paying the slightest attention to how the guests reacted . She is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist . That is why it is so satisfying , and so important to the story , that the General unexpectedly shows up -- for , as Babette knows instantly , a general will know what she has placed before him , and will appreciate it . For there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it . She is glad , very glad , he came , in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner , the only one she singles out for special treatment -- not either of the spinsters . But she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it . To anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real first-class Parisian dinner , as I have ( my father was Naval Attache to Paris in the 1980s , and I had my honeymoon in France ) , this dinner , and Babette 's satisfaction in making it , and the pleasure it brings to the diners , is absolutely convincing . If any art has the power to suffuse the recipient with a sense of joy , it is a fine French meal cooked and served in France . This movie makes a claim about the transformative effects of great art on the recipients . Before the dinner , the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome , dredging up old resentments . The old hymns fail to restore good fellowship ; people ignore them , talk over them . But the shared experience of sensual great art -- for the people can enjoy the tastes of the foods and wines even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art -- contents the people , puts them in a forgiving mood , reconciles them , and by making them happy , encourages them to love each other , and thus has a god-like sacred effect of bringing peace . This is the claim found in the modern art movement today -- that art can supplant the traditional religions in making mankind more peaceful . Thus , contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian belief , it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that Christian ritual cannot . After all my years in the art world , I have to say that this claim -- that art brings peace that religion cannot -- is overblown and invalid . But it is a pretty conceit and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film.One last note : at Babette 's arrival at the spinsters ' home , a particular French general , Galliffet , is named as the person who in 1871 executed Babette 's husband and son , and imposed a military rule that she had to flee . At the end of the film , as the General tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in Paris many years before ( before 1871 ) , at the conclusion of some military maneuvers , it turns out that this same Galliffet was his host at the meal . As the General tells the story , French general Galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman , the only woman he would risk his life for . Of course , that woman was Babette . Thus , ironically , the same French general who said he honored Babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Nazarin by the acclaimed surrealist Bunuel is ovbviously an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values . It is not a visual film and I think it would have played better on the stage . Bunuel takes us through this man , the nazarene that lives like Christ lived ; a true follower i.e. in poverty , and without a care for property and what the next day bringeth . Some might call it a parallel to Christ 's story but any follower and practitioner of the word , life should be like Christ in a way . But in essence Bunuel also inquires into the ogle of man 's selfishness and need to sin and how goodness may save us all . It is a bold statement to make that may enliven , or recite to memory the movie for some . Truth , be told the Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it . His selfishness is his folly and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin ; with the same face on each side . Lots of people represent sides of a coin in this movie , all with both faces the same . But the movie isn 't exactly memorable once it ends and one could attack many of its ethical perforations and effusions within the movie 's own doctrine . Not top-notch Bunuel but a " " surreal " " dream sequence that bunuel stages whithin where the message of the movie is framed and is worth noting for it shows you the capability of the director , Bunuel . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sensitive film does lack brilliance and , to some degree , narrative structure , but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed . However , the narrative structure point is debatable . While it gives the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes , and connects its thoughts with what might be described by the modern viewer as a " " story " , " I 'm sceptical as to whether this feel * needs * a " " narrative structure " " that is definite and detectable . Inevitably , it will be compared with SOMERSAULT in that its central protagonist ( I 'm not sure that 's the correct word ! ) is a young , and very young-looking , woman , whose newly discovered sexuality both confuses and empowers her - although of course Cate Shortland 's film tackles this aspect better . But while the possibility exists for reckless viewers to dismiss this film as a clich챕 , PEACHES is , in some ways , much more ambitious than SOMERSAULT . Perhaps that 's where it doesn 't quite make it . It 's certainly very different to Monahan 's first feature - THE INTERVIEW ! I 'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung added to the story . Who knows - maybe they did . They certainly rammed home the compromised and flawed nature of Weaving 's character - although I personally think this was achieved without the need for these scenes . * * * * * JUST SAW THE FILM AGAIN * * * * * * * * * On a second viewing , I can see how some would dismiss it as a telemovie dressed up as a feature . But I 'm not sure how distinct these ' categories ' are anymore , or even if we should be making that distinction . In any case , I do think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark efforts . On the other hand , the film 's structure is very formal , and its content is hardly challenging , at least in the way SOMERSAULT , TOM WHITE , THREE DOLLARS , THE ILLUSTRATED FAMILY DOCTOR , LOOK BOTH WAYS and THE HUMAN TOUCH are . The performances are all good , but I did come to the realisation that the main reason I was enjoying the film was because it fit the " " Australian " " genre , without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that this can be a fairly good reason for another person * NOT * to like it ! Indeed , it wasn 't until Lung enters the room in her Vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack a punch . But that leads us into another debate - * should * we expect that a film must challenge us all the time ? Certainly I enjoy being challenged by a film ( or a book , or other people ) , but is there no room anymore for what is simply a nice story ? I haven 't deleted my initial post on this film , because I 'm all too aware of the Orwellian overtones of such an act . But I would downgrade my initial rating from an 8 to perhaps a 6.5.As for nominations for AFI Best Film , my votes go to THE HUMAN TOUCH , THREE DOLLARS and LOOK BOTH WAYS - and I think LOOK BOTH WAYS should win . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The saddest thing about this film is that only 8 people cared to leave a review of it and NO-ONE felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boards.Made the same year as Philadelphia ... the Tom Hanks Oscar-winner ... this is the film that people REALLY should have seen and given awards to . There is more humanity , life , love , tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film I have seen ... and it is all true.In order for this to be printed I need to leave a few more lines of text : suffice it to say that anyone who REALLY wants to know what it was like to be gay in the 60 's and 70 's , and to understand just what AIDS was like before the modern drug " " cocktails " " allowed people to breathe a little easier ... this is the film to see . Oh , and I will add a personal comment about AIDS . Despite everything , there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror . When AIDS first arrived , it was called the " " gay cancer " , " and governments preferred to " " let them die " " rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags . Then it became clear that AIDS would also be a heterosexual disease . But the government wasn 't ready for that ; So when straight people began getting ill too , the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves ( examples : The Names Project : the quilt memorializing all those who died of AIDS ; Act Up etc ) The result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them , because no other organizations existed . This close contact , in my estimation , is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals . When AIDS first came on the scene , many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us ... and that probably would have been true if straights didn 't suddenly become ill too ; nevertheless , the strides that have been made in gay liberation - to the point that , as I write this , there are at least 5 countries in the world that accept gay marriage - these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without AIDS to bring us together . It is sad to think that all those people - both straight and gay - had to die before our common humanity became more obvious - but if what I am writing here is true , and I think it is - then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film . Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain . This movie was not the best the first time I watched it , but after about 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best films that I have ever seen . It takes place in New York , and progresses on through his lifestyle . He discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend ( Diaz ) . He goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination . This film was beyond my expectations , and is one of Cruise 's best films ever ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a very rare film and probably the least known from Shirley Temple as it isn 't on any of her collections.The reason why is probably because it doesn 't have a happy ending , unlike all her other films.Its also not a musical , although she does belt out one song called ' The world owes me a living ' .The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white , the version i have is in colour and on VHS , i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic , unlike i would say the colourised films of Laurel And Hardy which are dreadful.The film is good for its age and the story hasn 't dated at all , I 'm surprised no one has tried to do a remake.At times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged out , in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five.Although don 't be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it , especially when { Jerry } Gary Cooper steals a necklace , and hides it in Shirley 's teddy bear.The tension and slow build up to his actions , { while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room } is very well directed.Gary and Caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good.In all this is a good film from the early 30 's , accept it for its age . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Wooden Horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by British POW 's during World War II . It is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor , especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues Leo Genn . Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson ( later George Banks in Mary Poppins ) are marvelous as the two heroes . The direction is taut and fast-moving throughout .

" Running Out of Time rests somewhere in the middle of Johnny To 's cannon , in the " " solid good " " category . As a crime thriller it 's not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not blow you away but it has something else going for it . It 's a Johnny To film after all , it has to.Andy Lau has 72 hours to live . He decides to play a strange cat-and-mouse game with a hostage negotiator of the HK police , played by Lau Ching Wan . That 's the plot in a nutshell . On top of that To piles layers of twists and turns that keep proceedings interesting throughout . It occasionally becomes too convoluted for its own sake but never lets it get the best of it . However , just as Johnny To is about to hand over a slick and well-made crime flick ( which , let 's face it , are dime-a-dozen ) , he slips in bits and pieces that bring Running Out of Time alive as a full emotional experience , providing the soul and heart to the well-oiled skeleton.The concepts of synchronism and minimalism ( staples in his work ) are explored in great effect here . Always subtle , letting the images speak for themselves , giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shots , exemplary cutting to the score , it 's all here . A small love story in a bus between Andy Lau and a girl is among the highlights of the film and part of the " " heart " " I 'm talking about . So simple yet so powerful . Ditto for Lau 's and Lau Ching Wan 's car scenes and the bowling-room showdown.However something stops me from claiming Running Out of Time is a masterpiece . To has all the ability and craftmanship down to a notch but he can also be too workmanlike or bland at times . When he 's good , he 's REAL good . There are even isolated moment of pure brilliance that are just TOO good for their own sake , leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the movie . I 'm convinced that if he puts his heart to it , he can make a really great film . As it is , this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable . Underneath the slick HK style , it 's the black humour and heartfelt drama that makes this a compelling film . Worth watching , definitely . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I caught this movie on the Sundance Channel on cable one late afternoon . You might say " " Who Loves the Sun " " is a perfect leisurely pastime of a story , why ever not . You get to hang out with the trio : Lukas Haas is Will ( returning after abruptly leaving everyone years ago ) , Molly Parker is Maggie ( we learn she 's very much part of the family Bloom ) , and Adam Scott is Daniel ( is he friend or foe or fianc챕 ) , by the scenic Falcon Lake , Manitoba , Canada , captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vivid summer colors against sunshine and shadows . And supporting the trio are two more family members in the revealing mix : Wendy Crewson is Mom Mary Bloom , and R.H. Thomson is Dad Arthur Bloom . Writer-director Matt Bissonnette has delivered an ingenious unfolding of story-line and its various tentacle links - worry not , Haas may have a ' listless ' face , but humor will come as Parker and Scott enter the circle of friends reunited , wry smiles will break and knowing delights stir . Dialogs may be terse or even nil , yet we 'd get the flavor of what 's cooking , bemused or wondering.Yes , " " Who Loves the Sun " " can very well be categorized as a sleeper gem . The chemistry between all five principals sure gels and ' combusts ' , giving an energetic ensemble performance . After all , it 's all in the family , and the film sure doesn 't take itself too seriously.Looks like the official site is still available at " " wholovesthesun.com " " and there are information on the soundtrack by Mac McCaughan ( Portastatic with guitar tunes and strings ) where score excerpts are being played , and behind the scenes production notes , interview with writer-director-producer Bissonnette on how the movie and concept came about , the casting and more . Have always appreciate Molly Parker since her spare yet mesmerizing performance in 1996 Lynne Stopkewich 's ' Kissed ' , and she 's married to Bissonnette , who " " wrote the Maggie part for Molly .

" Michael Radford , the director of " " The Merchant of Venice " " makes a tremendous job in opening the play , as he makes it more accessible for everyone to have a great time at the movies watching this thorny account of a horrible time in history . The luscious production of the Shakespeare 's play is a feast for the eyes with its rich detail of the Venice of the XVI century.This is a story of revenge , prejudice and justice , as imagined by William Shakespeare . Having seen the play a few times , we were not prepared about what to expect . Mr. Radford takes care of presenting the story with such detail so it can be easily understood by everyone . Also , he has used a version of English that makes more sense , rather than relying on the original text . In fact , the way Shylock speaks in the film , doesn 't shock at all , being he , a member of a minority that has been marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church.Al Pacino tremendous portrayal of Shylock shows a man that is vulnerable , arrogant , revengeful , mean , and totally human , all at the same time . Mr. Pacino sheds light into the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technicality . His own daughter has left him and his whole world seems to be caving in on him . At the end of the film , we see a man that has been reduced to being the target of hatred and ridicule by everyone.Lynn Collins , as Portia is a happy discovery . Having seen her in lighter fare , she not only surprises , but she makes the best of her role and her time in front of the camera . She shows us she is a woman with a high intelligence , who comes to the help of her husband and his best friend , who risked his own well being in trying to help Bassanio get Portia 's hand.Jeremy Irons plays Antonio , the man who seeks Shylock for a " " bridge loan " . " After all , he knows his ships will be returning with fortunes from abroad soon . Antonio gets much more than he bargained for in agreeing with Shylock to the terms of the loan . Antonio 's best laid plans go astray when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his obligations . Mr. Irons gives a subtle performance.Joseph Fiennes , makes a good appearance as Bassanio . His good looks and his charm make an impression on Portia , who clearly sees a soul mate in this young Venetian as she knows he is the one for her . Also , in smaller roles , Kris Marshall , Zuleika Robinson , Charlie Cox , contribute to make the film an enjoyable experience.Ultimately , it 's Mr. Radford 's triumph because of the vision he gives us of Venice and its citizens during a horrible time in the history of mankind . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious toleration . After a session at a recording studio Frank Sinatra leaves and comes upon a group of kids beating up on another because he was Jewish . He lectured them as only an American icon could about the meaning of prejudice and what we had just fought for against the Nazis . The meaning could not be clearer.Both songs from this short subject were recorded and sold big for Columbia records . If You Are But A Dream and the song written for the film , The House I Live In . The latter is one of the best songs about an idealized version of America , we 'd all like to strive for.Sinatra in fact recorded The House I Live In again during the Sixties for a joint album he did for his Reprise record label . The album is now a rarity and it shouldn 't be . His collaborators were Bing Crosby and Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians with the orchestra conducted by Nelson Riddle.Axel Stordahl was Sinatra 's primary music conductor and arranger during the forties . When he died that position eventually fell to Nelson Riddle . Stordahl does the orchestration for the short and the Columbia record , Riddle for the Reprise record . Sinatra aficionados and others should listen to both back to back and compare . And catch this worthwhile film whenever it is shown . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I still have grainy , late night , no-cable , cheap VHS dubs of this show from waaaaaayyyy back when , late-night-commercials and all , when I would stay up to whatever weird hour they would slap this show on -- just so I could tape it.The series wasn 't really ABOUT Freddy Kreuger - only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything but a Rod Serling-esquire announcer . Instead , each episode was a distinct nightmare , using the traditional horror themes of horrific childhood , dating , cannibalism , dating , money , death , dating , and ... hmm ... dating.From the episode where a teenage boy accidentally says " " I will love you forever " " to the wrong girl , and is stuck with her ( literally , at least for a moment , they grow together ... ) , to the one where a young stewardess goes home with a strange man , only to find herself in his cabin , where he has a trophy room full of other stewardesses , and one I only vaguely remember which compared blind dates to hockey ( and the injuries and penalties that go with it ) - dating was definitely the scariest thing in the series.One episode had Jeffrey Combs ( Re-Animator , etc . ) as a motivated pizza merchant with a tasty new secret ingredient . Not original , but still creepy and fun .... Even so , some of the episodes were great . My personal favorite was " " It 's a Miserable Life " " where a young man is trapped working in his parents ' burger joint , when he wants to go off to college . Stuck talking to himself and doing little puppet shows with old cheeseburgers - until one late night when a weird guy comes through the drive through and suddenly his life is not the same . No , not Freddy , just a thug with a gun - turns out the whole mind-blowing episode is just that - the last thoughts that pass through the kid 's head ... along with a bullet.The second half of the same episode ( many of the Freddie 's Nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely connected short stories ) followed his girlfriend , who was also wounded , but not killed in the drive-by , and who is taken to " " the hospital from heck " " - they cram in all the most creepy hospital nightmare clich챕s , and then some - from accidentally having your mouth sewn shut - or waking up during an operation - to having your dead boyfriend try and lure you into the morgue for a little cuddle.Again , that was my favorite.Some of the episodes were much dumber , like ALMOST ALL OF THE ONES THEY 'VE MADE AVAILABLE ON VIDEO . They put the crummy ones out as representative of the series , and then nobody likes them , thinks the show stunk , and then they don 't put any more on video . It 's a Miserable Life is only available on PAL DVD in England - but I 'm still gonna buy it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this film earlier today , and I was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters . It didn 't feel like a film - it felt more like a documentary ( the part I liked best ) .

" As far as fake documentaries go ( fakumentaries anyone ? ) , this one is up there with the best ! It looks very real and that is what it aims for .

One can only hope that a government like that doesn 't exist ! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that ? Of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same ( 70s mentality ) : Screw the politicians and politics in general .

" This show has come so far . At first EVERYONE in the cast from Eric to Fez , they were all new actors and actresses , fresh faces , and just look what they accomplished . They stuck with the show and it was a success . Its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom I 've ever seen in my life . It will be sad to see it end but if they end this show , I hope to God that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had . I don 't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode . Go down swinging , get one last punch in . The show deserves it , the fans deserve it , if they go , let everyone know its going to end , like on Friends , and let the finale be huge . I say get Donna and Eric married , I say have Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again , I say have something interesting happen between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for so long , but of course it wont work out for him .

" Chris Nolan 's labyrinth like noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish . A first film is as complex as " " Memento " " or " " The Prestige " , " though maybe a little harder to get a handle on . Still it smacks of originality and creative drive , and has a " " twist " " as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp . Few film makers have made as good of use of their editors and attention to narrative that Nolan has . The story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street , until he follows someone , whose noticed him following others , and has been following him in tern , from there the complexity escalates and identities begin to rearrange . More naturalistic and realist than Nolan 's later work but just as razor sharp . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It 's like saying that old people have a past before they got old ( no kidding ) . The lives of the main characters were painful to watch , one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes . However , I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story .

" When this movie first came out back in 1984 , Prince was one of the hottest acts around . Everyone wanted to see this movie , which was not much more than a extended music video . The acting was pretty bad , but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time ? Despite that , it was still a very entertaining film ! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some all time classic comedy , especially their rendition of " " The Password " , " which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their " " who 's on first " " baseball routine.Appolina ( who went by a single name then ) provided some beautiful breasts , so you had the brief nudity covered . Plus , she is very attractive . And of course , the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded . Prince later on had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name , but at this particular time in his career , he was at the top of his game.This movie doesn 't rank in the all time great category , but it is pretty entertaining . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " The Buddy Holly Story " " shows the famous singer 's beginnings in the dunk Lubbock , Texas , to his rise to stardom , to his tragic death in a plane crash . Strengthened by the fact that Gary Busey , as Holly , plays his own instruments , this movie is the biopic in its purest form . There are some things that seem a little hackneyed , namely the people of Lubbock considering rock ' n ' roll to be the devil 's music , but the masterful performances outweigh any weaknesses . If there 's only one thing that 's for certain in this great big world of ours , it 's that Buddy Holly 's music will never get stale . Whether it 's " " That 'll Be the Day " , " " " Peggy Sue " , " or another one of his songs , they still sound great after all these years .

" I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and found myself thoroughly entertained . First off , it was clean , and I mean by my standards . The majority of kids ' movies today are full of crude toilet humor and gross-out jokes to elicit cheap laughter from the pre-teen crowd . Nancy Drew is smarter than that , however , and the humor is subtle and clever.The title role is played with a refreshing vivaciousness by Emma Roberts , who is perky and polite without ever becoming annoying . Unlike The Brady Bunch Movie , where the anachronistic characters are jeered and ridiculed , Nancy 's style is treated with respect and dignity . It 's a great moment when the LA " " style-conscious " " girls with their Paris Hilton streetwalker attire are dismissed by the boutique owner , while Nancy , in her penny loafers and homemade Butterick pattern dress , is embraced . This movie shuns the we-need-to-enlighten-this-wholesome-girl tack so many Hollywood movies take . Nancy remains true to herself and her values throughout.The mystery is just tense enough at times to be engaging . There were several suspenseful moments where my daughter nervously grabbed my arm , but there were no gratuitous shock scenes . It 's all based on tension and mood and is a lot of fun . The supporting cast is good , particularly Marshall Bell as the creepy caretaker . There are some great cameos by Eddie Jemison , Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that will make adults smile.This film deserves better ratings than some have given it . Not only was I glad not to be dragged to yet another computer animated film where talking animals burp and pass gas all over the place , but I was also very entertained . Had I been there without a child , I still would 've enjoyed the movie . This is one DVD that will have my daughter 's name on it under the Christmas tree . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Another in the they don 't make em like that category . This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean , sometimes over-the-top fun . Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the troubled Hadley siblings , and they really took the roles and ran with them . Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories , both honors being eminently well-deserved . They counterbalance the somewhat bland leads . Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors , but they 've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here . It 's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here , but that 's more of a personal bias than anything else . But that doesn 't take away from the movie 's overall entertainment value , which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable . If you 're up some night and this movie comes on I 'd say watch it . It 's well worth it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was a surprisingly very good movie , and an interesting idea .. However , it was just a little bit disappointing in that the ' Twist ' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie . Whilst watching , it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that , the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist , but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow . There were superb performances , there was never a dull boring moment , so totally well worth watching this one . It kept me interested right up until the end , and for me there isn 't many movies that can do that these days . I highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" An RKO Short Subject.A group of rowdy little bullies are given a lesson in tolerance by crooner Frank Sinatra , who compares America to THE HOUSE I LIVE IN.This little film delivers a pertinent message about the evils of prejudice & bias . Sinatra is an absolute natural in front of the camera ; intense & sincere , he is the perfect spokesperson for the values espoused here.Sinatra sings 혩The House I Live In , ' by Lewis Allan & Earl Robinson . This fine tune , with a solid , pro-American message , is being given something of a comeback since the horrendous events of September 11 , 2001.After Pearl Harbor , Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis . Not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service , but the output of the Studios was largely turned to the war effort . The newsreels , of course , brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week . The features showcased battle stories or war related themes . Even the short subjects & cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda , the boosting of morale or information dissemination . Together , Uncle Sam , the American People & Hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For me , the Tempest and its characters ( by which I mean the admirable ones ) are like old friends . Ever since I first began to experience the play through acting classes ( I played Ferdinand ) I found myself immediately caught up in the fantastic world that Shakespeare created . I can distinctly remember one student deciding not to play Ferdinand after all , and so I took the stage and had the honor of playing opposite an excellent Miranda.One of the virtues that a great friend has is that you can never fully know them - there is always something you can discover about their character . A film production of the Tempest of quality is thus like a visit to an old friend , dear to one 's heart : each visit presents one with new perspective on the memory we had of the work . With Prospero 's Books , the ritual and the elegance of the play was emphasized , the exuberant celebration of art within the art . Here , we see a vision as esoteric mysticism , with lovingly crafted interiors full of candles and chalk diagrams on floors , more Aleister Crowley than Naples nobleman . It also made me reconsider - why was it that Prospero was cast out of Naples ? His magical power is so palpable in this production that it makes one wonder whether it was just politics that doomed Prospero to exile , but rather the fact of his difference from his peers . So , in the real world , he suffered . Was cast out , powerless to change the wrong to the right . All of the villains in this play , whether they realize it or not , act in accordance to creating a more pain-filled , hell of a world - it is always in the interest of the oppressor to make life on Earth closer to hell . But Prospero manages to bring these terrestrial villains into his island , the realm where he has ( absolute ) dominion.Shakespeare brings his audience to the theater , the realm where Shakespeare dictates the events , the words , the outcomes . Shakespeare is , of course , Prospero - but what this film adaptation does that really honors the text is to make Prospero so sympathetic such a figure of reason , despite the fact that he is surrounded by what society calls irrational ( astrological texts , alchemical symbols , magical diagrams , etc . ) . Is it more rational to be a man of the cloth and murder , or to be a heretic and work towards the righting of wrongs ? Prospero IS a heretic , for the reason he abandons his magic is not because the books will lose their value in Naples , but because they are not necessary anymore - the world itself - has become the magic of the books.In Hamlet , Hamlet presents a play to his peers . The play accuses his fellows of conspiring against others for their own advancement . The reaction of the audience varies : while Ophelia is puzzled , Claudius reacts with stunned shock . This happens within the play , and then Shakespeare has this play performed for the men of his time . Did Shakespeare watch for their reactions ? In the tempest , Prospero lives the play he is constructing , and we live it with him . How do we react ? Do you react with simple delight at the happy ending ? Are you upset and shocked by the strangeness of this production , which is entirely fitting given the source material ? Do you feel sad at the fact that this little life , the play , is rounded with a sleep , as transient as it is eternal ? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for mankind 's life on Earth but man is weak , and unwilling to realize it in favor of petty power struggles . We have Claudiuses.Like a good friend , this film is not without its flaws . I disagree with the choice to paint some scenes entirely in blue . The dance of the mariners is rather tangential . But at the heart this is truly The Tempest , and one of its many faces . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A recent viewing of THAT 'S ENTERTAINMENT has given me the urge to watch many of the classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifties . ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a lesser film than ON THE TOWN . The songs aren 't as good , nor is the chemistry between the characters . But the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites , such as Tchaikovsky . And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl , with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top , and then running down the steps , while dozens of pianists play on the piano , is the best scene in the film , even though the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous . Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing . Sinatra then croons , " " I Fall in Love Too Easily , " " before having his epiphany about whom he loves . The color is beautiful , Hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution-free air ( Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties , let alone the mid-1940s ? ! ) , and the piano music is absolutely glorious . MGM certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I think the film is educational . However , it fails to treat the issue which sparked so much controversy : plural marriage . Also , the film fails to reveal what the LDS church espouses . Big opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually believe . I could not get a clear idea of what it is LDS views are on central topics of religion.I have many LDS friends and they are nice people . Would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they view their prophet 's more controversial statements . Maybe these statements are just too controversial to be treated in a film format , but it would have been great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith 's truly interesting life . After all , it gives insight into American thought on religion in the 18th century . Hope they do some documentaries on this fascinating subject , allowing historians to comment on Smith 's life . We may have a Mormon president some day . After all , Smith ran for president . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" That 70s Show is the best TV show ever , period . It 's up there with the Andy Griffen Show , Saturday Night Live , and The Simpsons in my book . That 70s Show continued on for 8 seasons , all of which focus around a group of teenagers / young adults dealing with relationships , separating from their parents , and their overall futures.The two main characters , Eric and Donna , are two teenagers living next door to each other . They have been living next door to each other for most of their lives , and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season . A large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working.Two other characters , Red and Kitty , are Eric 's parents . Red was in the service , so he really pushes Eric around . Kitty is just the opposite . Even though she drinks heavily , she treats Eric and his friends with a lot of care . Bob , their neighbor , is obviously Donna 's Dad . Bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show 's story . Bob also annoys Red to his full extent.The remaining character , Hyde , Kelso , Fez , and Jackie , are Eric 's friends . They also play a major role in the show 's story.Well , the First Season is great . This is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other . The First Season is original , funny , and enjoyable.The Second Season is good , although it isn 't as good as the first . It is a basic continuation of the First . Eric and Donna are together , and everything is working out great.The Third Season is my favorite . It went back and captured the First Season feel and humor . I also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch , making the show all that more fun to watch.The Fourth Season isn 't near as good . Eric and Donna Arne 't together in this one , making the show slightly less pleasurable . It is still funny , although I didn 't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons.The Fifth Season is the last season I enjoyed all the way through . It is the gang 's Senior Year , so that really helps with the story . The Fifth Season also had the best ending out of all the seasons.The Sixth Season is good for the most part . It is extremely funny , although it doesn 't capture the feel that the other seasons did . The gang is out of High School , so I believe that it didn 't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did . I also didn 't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them.The Seventh Season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way , although it didn 't do it all the way . I enjoyed the Seventh Season as I did all the others , and the ending is great.The Last Season flat out sucked . Eric wasn 't in it , which ruined it . Kelso wasn 't in it for the most part either , which didn 't help . I hated the Eighth Season up until the last episode . I thought that the last episode was really good , and a fitting ending to the series.So overall , if you enjoy comedy , give That 70s Show a try . They stopped making new episodes , but it is still on TV a bunch . I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7 . It is up to you if you want to buy Season 8 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For us , an Abbott and Costello movie is something you have to be in the mood for . I 'm very happy I recorded this -- my wife remembered it from when she was young , but I had never seen it . The family wanted to watch something not too serious before bed and this was selected.Our daughter has watched many of the old movies with us -- always complaining in the beginning , but most often coming around . She mostly ignored this in the beginning , preferring to check her email , but she started enjoying herself -- many times laughing out loud to the zaniness.It 's wonderful to think you can have a fun evening with a 55yr old . The mono-colour introduction that blends into the full-colour fairy tale . It 's a fun twist of a story that everyone is familiar with , that includes a little song and a little dance , along with everything you expect Lou and Bud to delivery.Watch it with your children and have a very fun evening ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A tour deforce ! OK the kid that plays Oliver is a bit toooooo sweet ! Starting with the great cinematography , color , costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie . I have seen several adaptations of this great novel , but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot ! It is a masterful Fagan , never leaving his character to do a song . You never really know if you like him or not , the same feeling I got in the book . In other versions you hate him from start to finish . Bill Sykes .... when you read the book hes a mean one , and so he is in this movie . Oliver Reed was masterful . His wife directed this masterpiece . I went and saw his last movie , Gladiator based on his many fine performances , not to see the headliners . The music fits the times and the mood . Who will buy this beautiful movie ? You Should ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I wanted to see Valentine ever since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever . When I watched Valentine , I was amazed at how great the story line actually was . It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all . The actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning . Some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor , and I admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring , but overall it was non-stop entertaining and suspenseful . It had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn 't deserve all the crap it gets . I recommend this movie to watch anytime , but especially on Valentine 's Day because it 's sure to give you a ton of chills . Oh , and don 't even pay attention to the trailer OR rating , please , DON 'T ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Chan is in New York and he gets involved with an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design.The war was over a year away from reaching America but the second world war was already raging everywhere else in the world and so it colored everything since most people probably realized that war was coming . Here the War isn 't mentioned but the fact that the film deals with the production of planes at the very least alludes to it . The mystery itself is pretty good , it the notion of plane sabotage lends itself nicely to a couple of rather tense moments . To be certain we are talking about Charlie Chan so we can be certain that he would live to fight another day , but there was no guarantee what condition he would be in , not whether anyone around him would survive.I really like this film a great deal . Its not one of the nest , and far from the worst . It is one of the truly rare things , a truly enjoyable one . Definitely worth a look or six . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival . The film 's title and in fact much of the outline of the film is from the Robert Graves poem Beauty in Trouble . Jan Hrebejk directs a screenplay by Petr Jrchovsk첵 from a story by Hrebejk and Jrchovsk첵. the story begins in 2002 when Prague is hit by one of those devastating 100 year floods that destroys the household of Marcela ( Ana Ceislerov찼 ) and Jarda ( Roman Lukn찼r ) and their two children Kuba ( Adam Misik ) and Lucina ( Michaela Mrvikova ) . Because of the moldy conditions where they now live Kuba 's asthma is life threatening . Marcela works and Jarda runs a chop shop out of the garage they live next to . Jarda 's shady occupation runs him afoul of the law and one of his theft victims becomes infatuated with Marcela . Evzen Benes ( Josef Abrh찼m ) is a wealthy businessman who divides his time between Italy and the Czech Republic and offers to care Marcela and her two kids . Jana Brejchov찼 is Marcella 's mother who lives with her common-law husband called Uncle Richie played by Jir챠 Schmitzer in probably the film 's best role . Rounding out this excellent cast is Em챠lia Vasaryova as Jarda 's mentally fragile mother who gives any money she gets to the local religious charlatan . There is a lot going on here for a small film and it 's good story with a great script and a lot of comic relief . Ales Brezina provides the music score with additional music from Czech singer Raduza and Irish singer Glen Hansard . There is a lot to like about this film and I would give it an 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this film when it first came out , and didn 't know what to expect exactly . What followed the Overture was one of the most pleasurable filmgoing experiences I have ever had . A lush score of songs and music by Britisher Leslie Bricusse ( of Doctor Doolittle & Wilie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory fame as well as making his mark on the Broadway musical scene ) , and scored by the incomparable John Williams . There 's not a bad song in the entire film . Plus some of the most exquisite cinematography , costume design and filming locations I have ever seen in one film . Not to mention the Academy Award nominated performance by Peter O 'Toole , and the equally strong performance , in my opinion , by the wonderful Petula Clark . Now , given that Peter is not the same caliber a singer that Petula is , he still manages to sell his songs to the audience , and that , after all , is what it is all about . This is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by James Hilton , and deserves to be treasured for generations to come . I recommend this film for family viewing , though most men will consider this a ' chick ' flick . But if you like a truly great film musical , then this film is for you . But be warned that a standby box of Kleenex is just as important as popcorn for your viewing pleasure . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" As I am always looking for something new and unique , I watched this film online . I thought that it would be just another " " B " " rate movie but I was amazed at the acting by the two main characters . All of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed . The plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story.This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp , " " Dumb and Dumber " " or blood and guts . This is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting.I would prefer this movie to many " " A " " rate movies I have seen even a great number with high box office earnings.I highly recommend this movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The choice to make this SNL skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones . The humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor , and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or two.Oddly enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided , but that may have been because the constraints of live television schooled me to not expect it . I suppose I was thinking more " " Leisure Suit Larry " " risqu챕 than the producers were ... Definitely not a PG-13 movie , which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors , but still better premise and writing than its more dismal ones.I liked it , but I doubt it will be a smash hit ... ( which is sad , as Tim Meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other SNL alumni tend to ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Barbra Streisand in 1964 was still a curiosity , and probably raised more than a few industry eyebrows when CBS signed her to 10-year , $ 5 million television deal ( nothing these days ) . But more important than that , Barbra and her manager insisted on creative control--and got it . She had this special filmed her way , and for the most part her vision was by turns clever , canny , and incredible . Opening Act I with the title song ( not written specifically for her ) , Streisand races through a classy cast of songs linked with " " I 'm Late " " ( from " " Alice in Wonderland " " ! --she even keeps in the line about fuzzy ears and whiskers and " " too much time to shave " " ! ) ; this is a totally charming , if not bizarre , selection--and enjoy it because it didn 't make the TWO soundtrack albums released . She slows down for " " Make Believe " " ( which gets perhaps too slow ) , but the dramatic " " How Does the Wine Taste ? " " is amazing . " " A Kid Again " " is cute ( with Streisand looking tiny in a huge chair--is that where Lily Tomlin got the idea ? ) , as is " " Sweet Zoo " " ( " " I 'm an alligator--crocodile ? ? --no , alligator ! " " ) . " " Where is the Wonder " " is very cool and elegant , and her " " People " " number , surrounded by an orchestra who tap for her at the song 's close , is stunning . Act II is set in New York City 's Bergdof Goodman , with Streisand acting kooky in high fashion get-ups ( when she playfully stomps on the mink , the audience watching the tape actually gasps ) . Act III , before a studio audience ( made up of lucky fan club devotees ) , begins with a powerful version of " " When the Sun Comes Out " " ( Streisand actually looks out of breath at the dramatic close ) , followed by " " Why Did I Choose You ? " " ( probably her best early song ) , a too-quick " " Lover , Come Back to Me " " ( where she 's ultimately drowned out by the orchestra ) , and a ' Funny Girl ' medley . The finale , " " Happy Days are Here Again " , " which reportedly took 12 takes , closes the hour in amazing fashion . Sponsored by Chemstrand ( a fiber-making company ! ) , this black-and-white gem moves fast , with jazzy set-ups , terrific cinematography , kicky sets and costumes . They really don 't make ' em like this anymore--and that pertains to the special and to La Streisand . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film gets off to a bad start . An incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly-done , truly amazing spaceship crash . Then things go downhill again , as you realize that the survivors are all a ) bad actors ( apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath ) and b ) almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster-fodder . Hell , half of them don 't even speak English , preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all . You feel as if you were watching " " Deep Blue Sea " " meets " " Silence of the Lambs " , " minus the good bits . And unfortunately , the entire thing tries to hard to be " " Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter " " during the daylight scenes . Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he is no Anthony Hopkins , and he frankly annoys as the smart hyper-cool psycho . There is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor - but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or so ... But then things take a turn . I can 't exactly pinpoint the moment , but soon the movie gets a lot better . It also feels less chopped - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative , and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a show-stealer . By the time the first monsters appear , the film is actually quite enjoyable . By the time night falls , it is great . Thrilling , horrifying and exciting . And even the character development of most main characters is well-done . If you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you 're in for some GREAT entertainment . Besides , the visuals are eye-candy , and I honestly admit : I love the colour and the tone of this movie . 7 / 10 ( could have been 9 / 10 , if only .... ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations .

" The Brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family : the twenty years old Emily Brighton ( Taylor Roberts ) is retarded due to a fall when she was one , and her overprotective mother Martha Brighton ( Amy Madigan ) blames her negligence for the accident . The seventeen years old Evie Brighton ( Lauren Ambrose ) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily . Their father Harry Brighton ( John Savage ) , a bank investor , lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads . Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities being rejected , and teaches the poetries of her own to Emily . When Martha hears Emily repeating the poems , she takes notes and shows them to the English teacher Stewart Worthy ( Christopher Lloyd ) , who believes that Emily has had a moment of geniuses . When Evie 's only friend James ( Fran Kranz ) reads the notes , he immediately discloses the truth about the authority of the poetries . But when Martha becomes aware , she finds the reality of Evie , triggering a series of revelations . " " Admissions " " is a very powerful drama about needy of love and guilty complex . The performances are stunning , and this is the first work of Lauren Ambrose , from " " Six Feet Under " , " that I see and she is amazing . This independent movie is an excellent choice for the viewers that are looking for a refreshing story based on the acting of the cast .

" OK . I admit . I 'm one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved DVD player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series . Star Trek ( Next Generation ) was my first space date , and since then I 've switched partners regularly . I 've seen 'em all , it seems , and my favorites are 짬Lexx쨩 , 짬Farscape쨩 and the new 짬Battlestar Galactica쨩 , in other words : the newest , state of the art space operas . But , I also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones , the cheap ones , like the magnificent four seasoned BBC show 짬Blakes7쨩 . Here , the budgets are smaller than hobbits , the special effects seem to be made on a Commodore 64 , but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor , the acting dead serious and at times even high class ? But why do they always speak English in the space future ? Because this is NOT the future , it 's fantasy for kids . Still , it can be irritating at times . Me , being a Norwegian , have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series , like science fiction , for Scandinavian viewers . I never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened . But it did , actually , once , and even in my own homeland , Norway . I was two years old when the so called Fjernsynsteatret ( TV theater section ) of our national public service channel Nrk produced this three episode version of Blindpassasjer ( The Stowaway ) .When I first heard of it , I was not surprised of the fact that until this day , the show has only been screened once in Norway , making it impossible for me to actually see it . It went on Swedish , danish and Finnish television also , in it 's time , but that was a long time ago . There have been no video or DVD release of it , not a surprise either , and when it was screened on an art house cinema , this happened in Bergen , a city far far away from Oslo ( where I live ) . And then there 's another fact about 짬Blindpassasjer쨩 that didn 't surprise me , that it was written by the two Norwegian authors Tor 횇ge Bringsv챈rd and Jon Bing ( Bing & Bringsv챈rd ) . This duo basically introduced the SciFi genre to Norwegians in the seventies ; they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose . In my opinion , Bringsv챈rd is the most interesting of the two writers , and has written several great and entertaining novels , masterpieces even , some of them hilarious , such as 짬Bazar쨩 and 짬Syvsoverskens Dystre Frokost쨩 . No other than this guy , also an acclaimed dramatist , could construct the script of 짬Blindpassasjer쨩.When I finally got to watch it , it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on VCR in the 80 's , eventually managed to transform it to DVD and give it to me . He was a nice bloke . So I sat down and watched it , with Swedish subtitles , bad sound and some scrapes and errors ; but the thing came through and I was surprised that I eventually came to love it.The exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in Blakes7 , and the credit goes to Caprino studios ( who made the famous Fl책klypa Grand Prix ) , and the interior of the Marco Polo ( the space ship ) works better than I 'd expected . The acting is typically theatrical , but it works better than when they play Ibsen , to put it mildly , and Bj첩rn Floberg carries his role solidly , as does Trini Lund . The legendary actress Henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre , but this is an ensemble play , and I 'm happy to say that Ola B. Johannesen carries his mustache with nobility , and Marit 횠stbye is a really hot space chic of my standards.But is it really that good ? Well , one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending , the pretentious criticism of 짬modern society쨩 , but yes , it 's , well , not really really really fantastic , but charming , cool , nostalgic and pleasant . One and a half hour of classic Norwegian SciFi . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Tweaked a little bit , ' Nothing ' could be a children 's film . It 's a very clever concept , touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes , and goes against pretty much every Hollywood convention you can think of ... what goes against everything more than , literally , " " nothing " " ? Nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives . All that 's left is what they don 't hate , and a big empty white space . It 's hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film , especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot . It focuses on pretty much one subject , but that 's prime Vincenzo Natali territory . If you 've seen ' Cube ' , you know already that he tends to like that type of situation . The " " nothing " " in this movie is apparently infinite space , but Natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic , if only because there 's literally nothing else , and nowhere else to go . The actors sell it , although you can tell these guys are friends anyway . Two actors from ' Cube ' return here ( Worth and Kazan ) , but are entirely different characters . They change throughout the story , and while they 're not the strongest actors in the world , they 're at least believable.The reason I say this could be a children 's film under the right tweaks , is because aside from a few f-bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence , the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids . So I find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore , especially considering there isn 't very much of it . This could 've gotten a PG rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue . There is very little objectionable about this film , but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it . I only say that 's a shame because not because I support censorship , but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure.At any rate , this is a reasonably entertaining film , albeit with a few dragged-out scenes . But for literally being about nothing , and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing , they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Writers probably shouldn 't get a bonus , everyone else SRO for making the movie.Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT.Natasha 's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric , to say nothing of her beauty , that anything she is in goes on my favorite list .

" Let me say first of all that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before I realized I was totally uncoordinated . I 've always thought it was cool watching cats that know how to get extreme on ' em do their stuff , but I 've never been a skateboarder and have never really followed the sport . That being said , I thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary . Some reviewers have said that these dudes were sort of waving their own flag a bit , but what the hell ? It looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the skateboarding world a jolt and they 've provided some good footage of their innovations to back it up . It 's great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in California provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating . I never would have realized where extreme skating came from , but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary . I 'm sure it 's at least a tad biased , but aren 't all documentaries ? Worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or , as in my case , anyone who grew up in the 1970 's . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right . The only problem is the annoying visual style , which will either make you hate the movie or hate Tony Scott . I really feel sorry for the cinematographer because I 'm sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the DP for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like it 's been possessed by demons . I wouldn 't have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when it 's spread through out the whole movie then that 's when we have some problems . The same annoying style was recently used on " " Domino " " and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie.-Another person I feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great Harry Gregson Williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images . Somehow , Williams wrote some decent music for the movie but I 'm sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better . The sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience , it rather makes you feel like you 're being punished . The overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it . I don 't know why Scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie.-The acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals . Little Fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart . If the end of the movie doesn 't make anyone cry then they 're dead on the inside . Denzel Washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily , for him he gets to play a great character . The whole idea of a man that 's lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but Washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character . I love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge . Radha Mitchell plays Marc Anthony 's wife and she along with Fanning are the two reasons why I can 't hate the movie too much . J.Lo 's husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesn 't really stand out much . Mickey Rourke and Chris Walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact.-One thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray Mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie . A little too late for that if you ask me . Let 's hope that Tony Scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him CAN and must do better than this . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The early films of the Dead End Kids ( before they were re-christened " " the Bowery Boys " " ) were all very entertaining and well-produced films from Warner Brothers . Despite their being rather formulaic , they still had excellent writing , acting and hold up well over time . Do NOT confuse these with the cheap Bowery Boys films from Monogram Pictures--despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey , these films were several notches below the earlier films in regard to quality.The film begins with tough-guy John Garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship . Unfortunately , shortly after this he 's on a drunken binge and is blamed for a murder he really didn 't commit . The problem is that he was so loaded that he wasn 't sure he didn 't kill the man , so he runs away and lives the life of a hobo . Eventually , he meets up with feisty May Robson and the Dead End Kids--as well as a lady you just know will become his girlfriend given time.Where the rest of the film goes was not all that surprising , but because of the quality of the film , it doesn 't seem to matter . Garfield and the Kids are at their best and this is a film sure to please all but the pickiest of viewers . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie was amazing . Never before have I seen such a film that brought me to the harsh reality of drug use quite like this one . There is no glamorizing , sugar coating , or glorifying heroine . This movie shows the true struggles , pain , and loss people go through when dealing with this drug . Good film , decent emotionally packed acting , and a great storyline . A much watch ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For Urban Cowboy John Travolta plays one of the stronger alpha males ever portrayed on the big screen . He 's a decent enough young kid who leaves his parent 's homestead and strikes out for the big city of Dallas where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to find him work in the petrochemical industry . In 1980 that was beginning to boom and Texas was definitely a growing place in the USA.Travolta does a good job in making we the audience care about his character who when you come right down to it is a sexist pig . He meets and marries Debra Winger who 's from the same background , but she 's got some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men . And when she beats him at Gilley 's mechanical bull , a man 's game , that 's it for him.Scott Glenn who 's an ex-convict is working at Gilley 's and this film was his breakout role . He 's a real snake in Urban Cowboy , he gets Travolta 's goat with a mere look and he moves in on Winger . Travolta in turn takes up with rich girl , Madolyn Smith Osborne who 's slumming at Gilley 's . Despite the characters , Urban Cowboy was really one gigantic commercial for the self-styled biggest honky tonk in the world . Gilley 's is no longer there in the suburban Texas community of Pasadena , but the memories do live on . And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of country / western songs that were featured in the film . I 'm not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for Urban Cowboy , but it 's the only reason I can think of why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this film . I especially liked Johnny Lee 's Looking For Love , if it was specifically written for this film , it 's a disgrace that it wasn 't nominated for Best Song.I liked Debra Winger 's character best in this film . She doesn 't lose a trace of femininity , but she stands up to Travolta and does it in style . And this review is dedicated to that yet as unknown woman who will one day be the first woman bull-rider in the Professional Bull Riders . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Hari om " " is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name ( played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding ) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India . There 's no " " Bend it like Beckham " " backdrops and stereotypes , and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood ( however , the soundtrack is well worth procuring ) , but rather , the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors . Fortunately for us , Hari Om 's companion is a young and beautiful French woman in search of a journey . With overtures of an " " Y Tu Mama Tambien " " trip toward self-discovery ( without the sex and fatal disease ) , this beautiful film calms and brings the philosophic mind . Against the initial juxtaposition of the protagonists , all identify with traits of both and the cultural divide disappears as humanity steps in . Most succinctly put , the movie 's central theme , " " Everyone has a love story , don 't let yours pass by " " teaches us a great deal about love on a number of levels . Don 't let this film pass you by ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Poorly cast , terrible script full of holes , hot blonde gets eaten alive , The evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache , one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor , terrible special effects , they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster ... Awesome . The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings . Haha . Good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners . I highly enjoyed this movie , but before you watch it make sure you 're in for a good laugh . I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious . I can not , in my right mind , think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously . However , if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy , I really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed . Very simply . So get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie . It brought some joy into my life . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The second in director Cohen 's trilogy of Second World War comedies ( the others being 혩Till Death Do Us Part ' and ' Adolf Hitler - My Part In His Downfall ' ) is a film version of the BBC 's long running ( and much loved ) situation comedy . Like most transfers of television shows , this movie suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches . Some of which work better than others for example the scene where a high ranking army officer floats down a river is a memorable , surreal moment.The joy of this movie is it 's representation of a past that probably never existed and an England which is defined by picturesque countryside and the chance it offers to see veteran scene-stealers such as John Le Mesurier given their biggest film roles . Arthur Lowe is superb as Captain Mainwaring , a bungler , who , when the chips are down , displays great courage and saves the day ( the climax is probably the character 's greatest moment ) .Episodes of the television series are of course funnier but as an introduction to a British legend , you cannot find anything better . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well , I can safely say I 'm human , Wong . And I didn 't throw up . I laughed . And laughed . If this movie made you puke , there is something wrong with you . But this movie is incredible . I bought it four days ago , and have watched it 5 times already . The animal cruelty gets my heart , but not long enough to be guilty . The movie is shocking , disgusting , and vulgar . The acting is horrific . What else do you want from a movie ? I am a die-hard cult film maniac . Pink Flamingos is awesome . It makes Rocky Horror , as someone has said , look like the teletubbies . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
... " This isn 't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect , either . In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation , and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments . Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one 's family isn 't hilarious of course , but the dialogue is very knowing ( " " five months of peace is just what I want ... " " ) and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit , but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version . The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness , which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son . The environment that he is in , however , then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness . In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there , the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man , and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return . He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives , but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.Kubrick 's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film , and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you . When he explodes , you won 't be sure how far he can go . Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic . If you want a great viewing experience , then this is an example that well and truly shines ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old , where actors didn 't have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their film.Firstly I think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita , it is definitely the making of the film.I have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy . In response to this , I think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis , however considering this is a Barjatya film I think that compared to MPK , HAHK , HSSH and MPKDH , it has been toned down significantly . HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places.In this film however , when the sentimental moments come along , you find yourself smiling , wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to them.Another major plus point is the performances of Shahid and Amrita . Both have acted very well , especially Shahid who looks great in the film . Amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star.Although I really enjoyed the film as a whole , I do feel that it was too long . Some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact . I also think the music , although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack had been available . Although the picturisation of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein are wonderful.All in all , I definitely recommend this film , its romantic , looks stunning and has a dramatic climax ( I won 't go into details , just in case you haven 't seen it.PS. If you 're prone to crying-take a tissue ! ( I needed several ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well no , I tell a lie , this is in fact not the best movie of all time , but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody I know has seen.It 's a buddy cop movie starring Jay Leno and Pat Morita ( Mr Miyagi ) with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something , but that doesn 't matter. the reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads , who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friends . The whole culture difference thing is done quite well , in that it 's fun to watch , it 's completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way . The soundtrack is cool , once again in a cheesy 80 's kind of way , it suits the movie , I 've been trying to find one of the songs for ages , but as I 'm working from memory of what I think a few of the words were i can 't seem to find it.Another thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever , but I won 't give that one away , oh no ! In conclusion I 'd take this movie over 48 Hours \ most of Eddie Murphys output including Beverly Hills cop , and whatever buddy junk Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have to their names . If you 're looking for a buddy cop movie and are getting fed up with " " straight white cop meets zany streetwise black cop " " give this a shot . You might be pleasantly surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with " " straight Japanese cop meets zany streetwise white cop " . " I 'm giving this 7. to be honest I like it more than that . I 'd rather watch this than a lot of stuff I 'd give 8 . But I guess I know deep down that it 's some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world .

" " " Closet Land " " tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements . You could read lots of stuff about the movie 's plot before hand , but you don 't really need to . All you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation . Along the way , we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated . We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place . Especially when you have absolutely no control over it.In the end , the movie amounts to a warning ( really though , the movie has several different aspects to it ) about what happens to people 's freedoms when they " " look the other way " " and ignore injustices happening to those around them.If you 've got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this , I strongly recommend that you do so . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Victor McLaglen , the title character of John Ford 's THE INFORMER , reminded me of the circus man from Fellini 's LA STRADA . Anthony Quinn played the brutish man , who may have even been influenced by the pug-faced , Oscar-winning performance given by McLaglen . Poverty-stricken Dublin is the true-life , atmospheric setting of the picture , which takes place in 1922 . Dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep Irish patriotism and the fight of the Irish Republican Army . The conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes THE INFORMER tick . McLaglen 's large , simple character just wants to go to America and we 're reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently . Two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken Irishman . One is the previous , the other a WANTED sign . Should he do it and get the money to go ? John Ford once famously said , " " My name is Ford . I make Westerns . " " After seeing this film , he obviously could do a heck of a lot more . The serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about . And the look of the piece is amazing , consisting of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable Ireland night . Ford was always known for his luminescent , gorgeous cinematography that helped to foresee the conflicts within his characters . This is hard in color , but he did it in pictures like THE SEARCHERS , painting John Wayne in a sometimes vicious manner . Victor McLaglen 's performance not only benefits from the lighting , but by the sheer simplicity of his acting . He shoves a lot . He knocks people out . He is a brute who knows no better . He should , however , know whether or not to cross the IRA.See the film to find out the gritty details . See it also for McLaglen and Ford 's patriotic portrayal of the IRA . Max Steiner 's score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters , placing more emphasis on them . This was usually only seen in silent films , especially Chaplin . The topic of naming names or " " informing " " is obviously still important . Just look at how the media covered this year 's Oscars , giving much attention to the Elia Kazan scandal . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The End Of Suburbia ( TEOS ) is a very useful film . It 's also important and provocative . There seems to be no middle ground with either the film or its main source of entertainment , the anti-sprawl Meister , James Howard Kunstler . While I am not a big fan of the New Urbanism , my criticism of it is because of its small vision . In the case of New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe - another talking head - you finally hear what 's somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added TEOS out-takes ... Calthorpe just doesn 't understand peak oil . I 've used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to get at the importance of land as a factor of production - a fact long diminished by Neoclassical Economics - and also as a vehicle for educating about : peak oil , our wastrel land use , global warming , our threatened food production , public transit our compromised futureMove over South Park ! ....

" Aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat , this film rings true on the chaos of the post-war.Beautiful photography , and a powerful national expression of the Polish national character.It 's very slow at points , but its entire pacing is so different from American and Western European films that it 's quite refreshing.Both lead actors do a very good job .

" If a more masterful adaptation than this one even existed , you need not look for it ; you will find all and more in this near-perfect presentation of Charlotte Bront챘 's masterpiece.Rarely have I seen a film that would urge me to read the novel on which it was based , but I admit to that here . Although I have not read Jane Eyre , I am convinced that I have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or of intensity and emotion . I only wish to explore the novel due to the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has stirred within me.I need not divulge anything in the way of plot here . Let me just say this : if you are perhaps unsure as to whether you should watch or read the beautiful story that is Jane Eyre , I implore you to doubt no more ! Every atom of might and magic that has reared Jane Eyre as a popular classic of English literature has successfully been captured in this film.What Bront챘 did not bring herself , Clarke and Dalton managed to translate in the limelight with stupendous intensity . The movie 's success is , no doubt , due in no small part to their acting prowess.Love Jane Eyre or hate her , but appreciate the richness , the vitality , the truth of the story ; love the characters ; love the actors ; all just as you would love what is great in cinema . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant ! i love it ! all the story lines are so good ! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real , and it really drew you into the show. the show is basically about this family called ' the Days ' and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day ( mum ) , Jack Day ( dad ) , Natalie Day ( sporty daughter ) , Cooper Day ( outsider son ) , and Nathan Day ( boy genius son ) . each episodes a day of their life , with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things it could 've continued with , I 'm really sad another season wasn 't made. it was a great show I 'm gonna miss it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

They strangle Gisaburo and dump his body inside a well in the woods , and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo moved to Tokyo to work . Three years later , the locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo , and Seki is haunted by his ghost .

" I saw this movie when it was new . Later I rented it in Japan after having been here three years , afraid that I would cringe when I viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience . The movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between Japan and Pennsylvania ( where I 'm from ) . Not all the stuff is factually spot on , but the tone is perfect.I 'm still in Japan many years later , and I continue to enjoy this film for its even-handed treatment of the two sides in the story . Interestingly , although the Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original , the dialog is redubbed in the Japan version to cover up obvious second-language delivery problems.I noticed one reviewer uses this in a Japanese class . I think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with Japan by watching this film than by reading any of the " " serious " " books on the matter ( most of which were written in the 80s and financed by propagandizing Japanese companies ) .Don 't be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who , among other things , found it implausible that the Japanese would want to build cars in the US . ( Of course , the Japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction . ) This is a very warm and funny movie that I would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clich챕s , like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music . Michael Keaton has never been funnier . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is your typical cheerful and colorful MGM musical from the early ' 50 's and it 's definitely on of the better ones to watch out there.The movie got directed by the genre expert Vincente Minnelli and stars Gene Kelly in the main lead . Both did quite a few movies together back in those days , of which this one is probably their best known one . The movie itself actually managed to win the best picture Oscar over the year , which meant it beat out movies such as " " A Place in the Sun " , " " " A Streetcar Named Desire " , " " " The African Queen " , " " " Quo Vadis " , " " " The Blue Veil " , " " " Death of a Salesman " " that year . A real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this delightful , bright and entertaining movie.When you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all , which is also thanks to the movie its beautiful color look and the many nice characters within this movie . The musical numbers are also all nicely done , which is no big surprise when you have people such as Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work . But really , couldn 't had everything that got told in this movie been done in halve an hour less or so ? I mean , we already know where the movie is heading to but yet it manages to stretch it out all for as long as possible . Not that it makes the movie drag in any parts , it just makes it a bit overlong . The movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it.One of the better MGM musicals , that is not without its flaws though.8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The phenomenon Helge Schneider defies easy description or quick categorization . Yet , for the international audience not acquainted to him , one could say he 's something like a crude mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman , adding a foible for Jazz music and 70s outfits . While his stage performances already are eccentric , his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous . " " 00 Schneider " " is , in my opinion , Helge 's best movie . He stars in the two leading roles - police detective " " Kommissar 00 Schneider " " and murderer-villain " " Nihil Baxter " , " and also in a precious smaller role as physician " " Dr. Hasenbein " . " In the opening scene , we see how modern-art-loving Baxter accidentally kills the circus clown Bratislav Metulskie , from whom he has bought a malfunctioning used Jaguar , when a beloved sculpture slips out of Baxter 's hands , fatally hitting Metulskie . Upon reading about the incident in the newspaper , 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick , Lt. Koerschgen , who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name . They pick up Baxter 's track quickly , and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion ( one of the movie 's best scenes ! ) , but initially fail to gather any proof . The story winds through many turns , with several scenes that don 't always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny , such as a daydream by 00 ( including the most unusual view on a running man 's brief-clad crotch in movie history ) , a police-department party during which Koerschgen gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized , and a visit at the already mentioned Dr. Hasenbein 's . Baxter , then , is finally caught attempting to escape to Rio de Janeiro on a plane.Always worth special mention is Andreas Kunze who in this case plays 00 's wife , as he 's usually appearing in drag performing women 's roles in Helge 's Movies.So all you folks out there looking for new laughs , I strongly recommend this movie . The catch ? You have to understand German ( as I doubt there 's an English version around ) ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8 , 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes ( Was this a record , or merely a faulty VCR ? ) . Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination . But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it . My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim 's original book . My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form . Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things , but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing , although in no way syrupy , and was also very well written . I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film , and so decided to buy her the videotape . I am now very glad that I did , and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-Mussolini Italian atmosphere . The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together , away from their families , in a rented villa in Italy . Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds . Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses , not only between these four very disparate mature ladies , but also with the occasional male visitor . If you want action , thrills , dramatic sex scenes , natural or man-made disasters , or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you . But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch , and if you care to give it a try you may , as I did , come to rank it among your much loved films.It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar . In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film , but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book , effectively unrolled before my eyes . ( Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this , the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio 's Decameron on TV . ) Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal , but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events . This works very well , although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story . Great credit is due to the Director , Mike Newell , and all members of the cast , particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I can 't add much to what has been said already , except I 'm going to have to because of the 10 lines minimum policy.I 've actually got this on a VHS-to-DVD copy , but the quality is quite poor and I desperately need for it to be officially released.I can just imagine what extras I would like to see ( Tim Healy 's character swearing his way through one of those ' Football Bloopers ' type programmes would be great ! ) . You can imagine it now , can 't you ? But of course , it looks like most people will have to carry on dreaming about a DVD release.Surely to God there must be someone in the DVD releases department at ITV who also knows something about British culture , is web savvy and has enough about them to look at IMDb now and again ?

" This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film-there is hardly any dialogue in it , apart from the narration ; and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly . I didn 't at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend ( who also has red hair ! ) It is almost an old fashioned type of children 's films , saying that children nowadays prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story etc-but I feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does . Maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages -not just children . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Written , co-produced & directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was complete total & utter crap from start to finish & it 's as simple & straight forward as that . According to the opening credits Jacqueline Hyde was ' inspired ' by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel ' The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ' , frankly if Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done to his story here he 'd turn in his grave . For a start I think Jacqueline Hyde was / is intended to be a horror film , the IMDb certainly lists it as such but there isn 't any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is . I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft-core porno than anything else & extremely tame with it , why sit down & watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard-core stuff that actually delivers the goods ? Why , that 's the question I ask here . It 's not even good porn either , besides being far too soft it 's dull , boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between . The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde ( 1998 ) title during the last century & judging by the IMDb 's plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish . This is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that 's not an excuse these days , shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy , the final ' shocking ' twist has probably the worst morph effect I 've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie 's breasts grow via more terrible CGI . That 's another thing , the film takes itself far too seriously . The subject matter sucks , is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch , alas it isn 't so it isn 't . Forget about any decent horror , violence or gore as there isn 't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff , the photography is of the flat hand held point- & -shoot variety , the music , production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script . The acting was awful , seriously this is bad.Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap , there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of . Any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap , definitely one to avoid . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Honore De Balzac 's genuinely bizarre short story on which this was loosely based gets an unsettling , albeit breathtakingly filmed , treatment here as a sort of forbidden-love blossoms over a period of time between man and beast in the early part of the nineteenth century . Thin and very blonde English actor Ben Daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars who gets lost whilst escorting an exiled ( ? ) french painter across the rugged , dangerous landscapes of the Gobi Desert . After literally going around in circles the two men give up ever trying to reach civilization again , thus each decides ( against better judgment mind you ) to go their separate ways with the promise of both returning to the same exact spot when and if a water source is actually found . This is of course how Daniels ' character comes to encounter the creature ( a wild and untamed female leopard ) and eventually form a seemingly unbreakable bond , or rather love , with it that both saves his life and nearly destroys it by film 's end . The exquisite cinematography , minimalist dialog , somewhat demented story which arguably hints at possible bestiality in about three scenes are what ultimately lead professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and overlong rubbish . While it is a film that isn 't exactly for all tastes mind you , I find it to be a subtle , though decidedly left-of-center mixture of fantasy with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere , highlighted by the fact that for more than half of the flick actor Ben Daniels is forced to perform opposite a wild animal ( four leopards were actually used as opposed to just the one ) , which plain common sense and a slight knowledge of theatrics dictates that it must have been a maddening and very difficult job that he managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you ask me ! Overall , I think that " " Passion in the Desert " " takes a while to warm up to , but if you 're a patient person who is willing to give it some time it does in fact cast it 's uniquely original spell over you in spite of everything ; and unlike most platonic human and animal relationship stories it need not require a talking pig , monkey or shaggy dog to keep your interest throughout .

" " " Radiofreccia " " is still a good surprise in Italian cinema . The film is based on a book of Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue , who also directs the movie and writes the music score -of course.The film is a portrait of north Italian province life , in the Emilia Romagna region . We 're in 1975 , the time of the first free radios -one of the boys of the movie creates " " Radioraptus " . " Youth wishes , friendship , love , sex , individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes , but the film speaks also about drugs -Freccia , the main character , is a victim of heroin slavery.Without being boring and moralist , the story flows very well ; the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well . Obviously Luciano " " Liga " " Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a movie professional , first of all he 's a musician . But he succeeds in making a good product . Unfortunately he 'll not repeat the success with his second movie " " Da zero a dieci " " -not good at all.In " " Radiofreccia " " actors are generally not very famous , the only star is Stefano Accorsi -one of the most popular young Italian actors .

" I 'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum , and many of the reviews . I think Tony Scott made a good movie here .

I 've previously seen Scott 's Man on Fire , Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all good movies , but I like this one more . It 's like a roller-coaster ride , with great soundtrack selections , visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13 , it is nice to see that someone isn 't afraid of showing nudity , gory violence , and have explicit dialog.It doesn 't hurt that Keira is super-hot , and even shows nipples in this one , either ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Four tales of terror regarding the events at a creepy old mansion are recounted to sceptical Scotland Yard investigator Holloway ( John Bennett ) as he investigates the whereabouts of the latest occupant of the house that dripped blood.One can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is 혩The House That Dripped Blood ' . This Seventies horror anthology is quite remarkable in the way that such a visually innocent movie is capable of inducing horror in even the most discerning of viewers . Incredibly , the number of depictions of violence on-screen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in conjuring up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination , all the while refraining from taking the obvious route of graphic violence . In a rare feature of early Seventies horror the technicalities of the movie are virtually flawless , from the faultless performances of the star-studded cast ( featuring the legendary Peter Cushing , Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt ) all the way to the superb direction and story telling courtesy of Peter Duffell and master of the macabre writer Robert Bloch ( the author of the novel 혩Psycho ' ) . The only real complaints that one may have with 혩The House That Dripped Blood ' are the somewhat asinine plot-twists at the end of the first two segments and the predictable ending of the picture , but even these minor details fail to detract from the overall viewing enjoyment.The first segment , entitled 혩Method for Murder ' , tells the story of Charles Hillyer ( Denholm Elliott ) , a horror author who rents the creepy house while he works on his latest novel . While working on the novel , Hillyer continues to start seeing the murderous character from his story in and around the house and soon begins to question the difference between fiction and reality . Elliott 's performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability . The key to this segment , as with the others , is the mystery surrounding the events that take place . The viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of Dominic is merely a hallucination , a schizophrenic disorder or whether the character is actually there . Duffell 's direction succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere coupled with a slow , methodical approach to engendering the tension and suspense required to make the segment greatly enthralling.The following segment features Peter Cushing as the new occupant of the sinister house . During a trip into town he comes across a wax museum of horrors and decides to venture in . While there , he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman that seems all too familiar to him . Cushing 's character ( Philip ) is then joined by his friend Neville ( Joss Ackland ) who also wishes to visit the museum , much to the dismay of Philip . In this segment the viewer is given no more than very subtle clues as to the mystery of the wax woman but in general the viewer is left in the dark . There is far less tension to this particular story yet the segment still succeeds in maintaining its air of mystery through a particularly harrowing dream sequence and the general ambiguity of the story . Duffell 's direction is once again exceptional and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four stories , there is no denying that through some creative direction and credible acting 혩Waxworks ' is still a delightful entry into the film.혩Waxworks ' is followed by what is , in my opinion , the greatest of the four segments 혯 혩Sweets to the Sweet ' . Christopher Lee stars as John Reid , the father to a young girl who to begin with has an inexplicable fear of fire which is soon remedied by caring nanny Ann Norton ( Nyree Dawn Porter ) . However , John appears to be harbouring a dark secret about the family . 혩Sweets to the Sweet ' is easily the most sober and intricate of the four stories and that is why the segment is undeniably compelling to the viewer . Throughout the segment small and subtle clues are released about the truth behind the family , but it is not until the immensely horrific final scene that everything slots neatly into place . This is the best example of how Duffell used dramatic tension and suspense to create the foreboding atmosphere that made the entire film great . Accompanied by a wonderfully arranged soundtrack , 혩Sweets to the Sweet ' is an exercise in sustained fear that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go until the agonising screams that end this piece finally cease . Personally , I believe that this short segment would have made an entertaining and haunting feature length movie and I would give this segment a rare 10 / 10.The film is ended with the story surrounding the missing performer that the investigator was originally interested in . Jon Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt star as two performers who are currently working on a horror movie . Pertwee 's character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he purchases his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries . However , strange things begin to happen when he wears the cloak and soon he begins to fear the worst . This segment , which places the inspector amongst the events , is a nice way to wrap up a wonderful anthology . Although there is an irrefutable air of camp to the segment this is , in a way , what makes the story so enjoyable . Unfortunately , there is little in this segment that could be classed as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming features . Horror buffs should definitely look out for Pertwee 's brief comment on Bela Lugosi 's and Christopher Lee 's portrayal of Dracula . This slightly comical and light-hearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspense-driven horror.To sum up , 혩The House That Dripped Blood ' is one of the greatest horror anthologies that features an incredible cast , great stories and above par direction . There are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed , fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely . My rating for 혩The House That Dripped Blood ' 혯 8 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" What a fun movie St. Ives is . It reminds me of the type of film made during the 40 's . Classic story , rounded off by characters and a plot that is neither over dramatic nor overtly complicated . In fact it isn 't over anything . Robert Lewis Stevenson 's story - here adapted for the screen - reads like Jane Austen for men . We do get a tale that has a romance at its heart , but there is plenty of fun too : battle scenes ( sort of ) , prison escapes , mistaken identities , swordplay , and the funniest line I 've heard in years : " " Only in Scotland would guests be announced by name at a masked ball . " " There is much hilarity , hardship , and not a little heartbreak as St. Ives tries to fight and find his way back to a family and life he barely knew.The cast is absolutely stellar with the too infrequently seen Jean Marc Barr absolutely perfect in the title role . Anna Friel is a refreshing delight as the resourceful Flora and Miranda Richardson nearly walks away with the movie as her wise and worldly , been there and seen-it-all Aunt Susan . Richard Grant provides comic relief of the highest order.This is not going to be the greatest movie anyone has ever seen , but its charms are undeniable and the entire film fairly bristles with an energy that bursts with life . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Inexplicably , I watched this movie for the very first time just a couple of days ago , and understood from the very beginning what all the fuss is about . This movie held my attention from beginning to end , and ran me through the whole range of emotions ( and might have helped me discover a few I never knew about . ) Dustin Hoffman absolutely shines as Ted Kramer . He is absolutely convincing as a man having to juggle at least three different challenges in life : jilted husband , workaholic ad executive and loving father . Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central to the movie simply because Joanna was absent for a good part of it , but when she was on screen she gave Hoffman a run for his money . The true standout , though , ( in my opinion ) had to be young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer . Children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakdown , and Justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with Dad , only then to have the confusion around why he should have to leave his Dad when it was his Mom who walked out on him . Young Justin didn 't seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role.All in all , this is an excellent , Oscar-worthy movie whose only weak point was what I thought to be a truly disappointing decision to go for the sappy and happy ending , which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle Ted and Joanna had gone through . But there 's not much else to complain about here.9 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First time of seeing Buster Keaton 's first feature film and I have to admit I liked it a lot and only wish I 'd stumbled across it years ago . The Rohauer blurb at the start warns that the Three Ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion , and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated . So , it 's rocky viewing in places , but I 've seen and survived much worse.It would have been OK as the 3 short films but as a take on Intolerance it 's inventive and funny from the start to the finish : In the Stone Age with baddie Wallace Beery riding an elephant and goodie Buster riding a pet brontosaurus ; In the Roman Age Buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging , No Parking signs in Latin ; In this technological Age of Speed Need and Greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump . Both him and Beery are after the Girl through the ages , a never ending tussle . Favourite bit : As the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera - an amazing second or two ! Great stuff , reaffirming my love of silent film comedy . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First saw this gem from Joe Sarno way back when , and I must say that after seeing it , I could never forget Jennifer Welles . At first I thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a Sarno film , but when Jennifer made her entrance , the first time I ever saw her anywhere , I was sat up and took notice . Her presence in this film is hard to avoid , and spices up every scene she 's involved in . I 've seen most of the rest of Sarno 's films , and the other films starring or featuring Jennifer Welles , and I must say that this was both Sarno and Jennifer at their collective best . Sarno 's direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb , and Jennifer showed ( figuratively and literally ) an acting prowess that make this a must see . Co-stars Rebecca Brooke ( aka Mary Mendum ) and Chris Jordan , both frequent co-stars of Ms. Welles , and also frequent stars of Sarno 's work , turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous , yet normal housewives . This film is Sarno classic . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Business vs. personal conviction . Profit vs. art.As with any documentary that pits the capitalist large corporations against the small producer , the viewer will invariably have to take the side of one or the other based on their own believes . This is as much a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us , against the old traditional ways where character and the art of making things matters almost more than getting the product sold.If you have to remember one thing from this movie , it is that the masses can no longer decide by themselves , they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics that tend to equalize and standardize taste in the same way as MacDonalds used to do for the fast bite ( something Parker himself admits to in the film against a backdrop of a Burger King sign ) . " " It is all about image " " against content as another interviewee says . That is the easy way , the standardized way . Easier than taking the time for a nice wine to mature , easier than to forge your own taste by trying and trying yet over again . Controlled branded taste is easier.There is a glitter of hope when even some of our cousins across the ocean agree that a few people are " " levelling " " the taste of wines to maximize the profits and ensure a maximum of it gets sold to the " " grey masses " . " Individuality and difference is sacrificed for the extra buck . It is nice to see that not everything or everyone is giving in to standardization , even across the ocean.As in many other areas of today 's world , dominance of a few and reduced freedom of choice impacts us all ... let everyone make up their mind and decide what to go for . Too much standardization kills the mind and taste ; difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice - and not just vacuum-packed " " more of the same " . " Standardization sells easily and a lot , and brings everyone to the same level - the lower one.On this , I am going to open up a nice bottle and wish you a hearthy " " sante " .

" I saw The D 's new film tonight at a special advance screening , and I was so blown away by its sheer greatness that I felt I had to come onto IMDb and get the word out . Admittedly , I was already a huge fan of the D 's work - I loved the HBO series and listen to their music weekly ( there 's nothing better to sing along to ) , but this appreciation actually made me more apprehensive going into to tonight 's screening ( for we 've all been disappointed one time or another by something we love when it attempted to make the jump to the big screen ) . With Tenacious D 's " " The Pick of Destiny , " " this is not the case.Simply put , this film rocks harder than anything I 've seen and is funnier and more majestic than anything Peter Jackson , Pixar , and Will Ferrell together could produce . It tells the story of the D before we came to know them , setting up intriguing histories of Kage and Jables ' upbringings , their comings together , and how they were inspired to write songs about such things as Lee , Sasquatch , and Dio . Most importantly , they reveal the true inspiration to the Greatest Song In The World , " " Tribute , " " and how it came to be ( which is different than the HBO Series ' version ) . After you 've witnessed it you probably won 't be able to remember it ( hence the Tribute ) , but your mind forever be changes by its genius.I don 't go out to movies very often anymore due to the high ticket price and the hassle of getting parking , paying outrageous concession prices , etc . , but I usually make exceptions when it 's starring someone I really love or concerning something of the the same variety . " " The Pick of Destiny " " was so good that I have no qualms going back to see it again when it releases nationwide , and I plan on convincing all of my friends to go , too . Last week we saw " " Borat " " and loved it , but this is honest to goodness TEN TIMES BETTER . For anyone who truly loves rock music and comedic brilliance , see this film .

" Recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work , handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual , but the entire family . Without resorting to preaching or Hollywood sappy endings , Tony Marchant 's drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way.Highest praise goes David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible performances . I had presumed before watching the drama that I would see some of their previous on screen relationship in Blackpool bleed through-- but it never does . Neither actor is recognizable from any previous work , and I didn 't see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes . In addition , Harry Treadaway 's performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic - throughout the piece , he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house , At times , nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic . As the viewer , I wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality , stop moping , and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives . But under the same circumstances , I see myself acting like any of them - switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything , including behavior that is completely unlike myself . It 's the show 's greatest strength - truth , without sugar coating , to force us all to think what we 'd be able to do under the same circumstances.This is a difficult , but must-watch show .

" It is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of " " acting adult " " is not engaging in sensuality . Instead , these kids see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it . Hoot is a film aimed squarely at families looking for a fun day at the cinema . The production values are good , especially sweeping shots of Montana and Florida . The soundtrack by Jimmy Buffet is a perfect fit . The young actors are spirited and refreshing.The plot , about a trio of kids who work together to save some burrowing owls from death at the hands of an unscrupulous pancake house empire builder , will engage kids . So many films make children appear powerless , it is nice to see a movie that shows children working hard to make a difference . And even though parents are absent or temporarily distracted , it was pleasant to see kids who want to follow in their parents footsteps and try to right injustices.If you are tired of all of the self-indulgent story lines about children that fill the cinema , give Hoot a shot .

" Crimson begins with some cool jazzy music so I liked it immediately , but as the film wore on I began to wonder if the music wasn 't the best part . We have some thieves pulling a jewel heist and when one does something wrong the alarm is triggered and the cops chase them and when the car turns around at a road block one of the thieves ( Paul Nash , Jacinto Molina , whoever he is here ) gets shot . Now , it seems like he might die but with the help of a drunken doctor and his mad-scientist friend ( and wife ) he is saved , with a part of the brain of some nightclub owner called " " The Sadist " . " The Sadist is unfortunate in that the gentlemen that kidnapped him lost their knife to remove is head , so to add insult to injury ( or , in this case , death ) , they remove his head using a train , leaving the body for the authorities to find , oops . Once the brain transplant is complete Naschy wants to ravage any woman that comes near him , because he now has the mindset of his donor . Well , of course this is all pretty improbable and features medical equipment that looks to have been purchased at Radio Shack , and overall it 's pretty cheesy and sleazy . But , it has a good early 70 's look and feel to it and the music is cool .

The earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion . If you haven 't seen the movie go and watch it and read the book , it is not only a love story , and yes , there were plenty of Italians in love with Cephallonian women , in fact , boat loads of Cephallonian women were taken to Italy after the war , it is a true depiction of history . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a massive fan of fantasy in general , and of the works of Neil Gaiman * in particular * , I 've been looking forward to this film so avidly , so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can scarcely believe it 's finally here . And you know what ? I needn 't have feared , the film version is bl * * dy awesome . Different from the book , but in a good way - less whimsical , more comical , still deeply sweet and enchanting.The special effects are absolutely spot-on , and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of Wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive.Proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing , and the casting in the main is a triumph , with the ghostly Princes ( whose roll-call read almost as a " " Who 's Who " " of currently cool British comedy - Rupert Everett , David Walliams of Little Britain fame , two of the blokes from Green Wing etc ) stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films ' funniest moments , which exist in abundance . In fact , the one minor criticism I have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little OTT , subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story .... Ricky Gervais ' cameo , for example , was far too much just " " Ricky Gervais doing his usual David Brent from the Office comedy persona " " for my liking , and in my opinion , created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story ( though in fairness , from memory I believe the Ferdy character in the original book WAS pretty " " Ricky Gervais " " -esquire when I think back on it ) .... But this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance . Charlie Cox , as the protagonist Tristan , captures the correct mixture of naivety , subtle comedy and self-realisation required for a story like this where a " " humble young boy embarks on life-changing quest " " ; Claire Danes as Yvaine is beautiful , feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal , a perfect interpretation of her stellar role ; Robert De Niro , in the cameo every reviewer is talking about , is indeed deserving of praise , rollicking good fun ( looks like he 's having a ball , too ) ... and Michelle Pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch Lamia , my favourite performance of the film overall . If you enjoyed her deliciously b ! tchy performance in the recent " " Hairspray " " then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this , too.So to round off this review : you will laugh , for sure , you will smile , and you may even cry - Stardust is a beautiful , heart-warming fairytale for all the family , with a heart of gold and more sass ' n smarts than is immediately apparent . One of my all-time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic Princess Bride , and Stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory .... and just as The Princess Bride remains fresh , smart and funny twenty years after its initial release , I believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness of Stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions ( or equivalent future device ! ) for many years to come . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren . I guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent . That is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent . Some of the other reviews point out how dumb Detention is , but many neglect to point out the positives . Any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed can 't be all bad . Why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens ? Aren 't there any other kind of teens ? Does every group of teens have one angry black guy ? One genius nerd that nobody likes ? One slutty girl who is very friendly and ( in this movie ) pregnant ? One disturbed anti-social white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented ( but what is the talent ? ) . And one laid-back black kid who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him . Then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color . They don 't say much but get shot at some point . Detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school . Preferably with the writers inside . The dialogue is bad , and the plot is worse . When the bad guys ( and girl ) finally hijack a van full of drugs , then they sit inside the van making out . They drive the van to the school because they want to re-paint the van at the school 's paint shop , but they never get around to re-painting the van . By the way , it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the Police Van . They also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score . For some reason , they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher ( Dolph Lundgren ) even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours . The handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles , so why go after them ? Anyhow , the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns , and they keep finding the teens ( including a guy in a wheel chair ) and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss . Towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed . For every time someone gets shot , there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss . The stunts are pretty bad . I read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of $ 10 Million , and I am amazed . When I saw the movie I figured maybe Lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher . Like maybe this movie was their end of the year exam . It was a test to watch it , but I passed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the final episode we deserved . At the end of the last season , things were left in a ' life goes on ' mood , which was hardly the wrap-up that this realistic series deserved . While not a happy show , this series was always one that made you think ( a rare thing on television ) , and this is no exception . ' Is death justified by reasoning ? ' ' Are morals reflective of society , or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power ? ' ' What is a just death , and can it exist ? ' All of these questions , and more , are posed by the writers of this show every week , and this is their final thesis . Fine acting , great writing , wonderful camera-work , brilliant editing , clean direction . If you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran , then get a hold on a copy somehow . If you never watched the series when it ran , then this will stand up on its own , but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts . For those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons , this is very satisfying viewing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" At one time ' Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation 's theaters . Not any more . Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle . The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime , a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop . He 's not a Dirty Harry type by any means . He 's just incredibly focused professional who 's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his duties혚like , say , a T.V. cameraman . Mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of Chase Renzi , a producer looking for a killer hook for her ' reality T.V. ' cop show . She thinks that Mitch will give her the ' edgy ' boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself . Enter Trey Sellars , a patrolman-cum-actor who 's watched way too many Police Story re-runs . Of course Mitch and Trey mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues.We know that Mitch and Trey are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie . That 's the way buddy-cop movies are suppose to work . In fact , it has to be said that Showtime rarely deviates from the time-honored clich챕s as writ by Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash . There 's a high tech McGuffin to get the ball rolling ( in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks . ) There 's a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin . There are chases , shootouts and explosions . We all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it 's all going to turn out . You know what ? There 's nothing wrong with that . Yes , we know the well-worn bases are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip , not the destination . Showtime doesn 't strain to be original . Instead its energies are funneled into its characters and humorous situations . As a result , Showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy.Robert De Niro is dryly funny as Mitch . In the past I 've thought De Niro to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy . Lately , though , he 's grown on me . He seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles . Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Trey . The best way to describe his performance is that Trey is what Murphy would be if Murphy weren 't so talented and hadn 't hit the big time . Rene Russo has a droll time playing motor-mouthed show biz shark Chase Renzi . She stalks through the movie chasing high Nielson ratings with awe-inspiring determination . In her zeal she re-vamps Mitch 's life to make it more camera friendly . She even calls upon T. J. Hooker himself , William Shatner , to show Mitch how be a more ' authentic ' cop . Shatner is funny , playing himself precisely as we expect him to be , loud , oblivious and slightly obnoxious.I have to admit I was really looking forward to Showtime and I wasn 't disappointed . Ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit . Today it 's doing moderate business at best . That 's a pity because Showtime is a whole lot of fun . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Skippy from Family Ties goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie . The film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves - except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave ( using Skippy to help out ) . And while the plot is corny and cliche , the corniness ( for example , an evil green fog taking off a girl 's clothes ) and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious ( and great ) . And of course , there 's nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who 's asking what happened to the love song : ) . Definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh . And while you 're at it , make it a double feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there 's an " " evil rocker " " ( as stated on the video box ) driller killer in black leather w / fringe .

It suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for , and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak .

" William Powell is Philo Vance in " " The Kennel Murder Case , " " a 1933 film also starring Mary Astor , Paul Cavanagh , Eugene Palette , Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan . A dog show in which Philo has entered his Scottish terrier Captain serves as the background for a locked room mystery with too many suspects . The mystery is very clever and the denouement both complicated and interesting . Since the talkies are still quite young , the camera work is a little static , but Michael Curtiz does a good job directing the action.The supporting cast is excellent ; the entire cast brings the film up a notch . Lots of actors have played Philo Vance , including Paul Lukas , Basil Rathbone , Wilford Hyde-White , Edmund Lowe , James Stephenson , Alan Curtis , Warren William and others . Powell played it the most ( five times ) and is the best fit for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time . This was made before " " The Thin Man " " catapulted him to big stardom - he had spent about 12 years in film by then , beginning his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20 . A remarkable man , a remarkable screen presence and a remarkable actor who lived to be nearly 92 . We 're so lucky to have his films available on DVD and on TCM today .

If you like this genre , you 'll love this film . If not , don 't bother.Some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves , and they have no regard for what happens to them . They 'll do anything to make a stunt work . Many critics panned Johnny Knoxville for a less active role in the first film , but not to worry , he is front and center in Number Two , and they have enough footage in the can to be half way through a Number Threee.This is a must see for fans of this type of humor.Chris Sansone , Entertainment Editor , Fort Bend Herald , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Henri Verneuil 's film may be not so famous as Parallax View , 3 Days of the Condor or JFK but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre . Action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed . After several years of investigation , special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman . But one man - prosecutor Volney , played by Yves Montand - thinks there 's something more to be investigated and so the film starts . This movie doesn 't deal with some exact theories , but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in today 's world .

" A powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and the smash Broadway play about the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delany , two " " colored " " sisters who lived past the age of 100 . Wonderfully played in their old age by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll , respectively , they tell their story in flashbacks to Amy Hill Hearth ( played by Amy Madigan ) , a white New York Times reporter . The flashback and present-day scenes don 't have as much inspirational value in them as in the book , but really are powerful . However , certain aspects of the sisters ' lives , such as the inter-racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their father 's stern personality are not presented clearly . You need to read the book to fully understand these things . Which is just as well , because the book 's just as great ! Aside from those flaws , it 's wonderfully done and performed , especially by Dee and Carroll , and a very powerful and educational movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This focuses around the lives of four women , all good friends , and their male companions . Each has a story , the men as well , everything links everybody to everybody and everything is being brought to a quick change after a trip the girls take to Palm Springs.Basically , the film is no different from other of the genre , but I liked the details . Brooke Shields is a divorc챕e that fears loneliness , therefore she bangs just about everybody to get to have a " " warm body " " next to her in the morning , but then can 't really commit . As a man , I find these women are a blessing : ) , but she is not a happy person . Everything else that happens revolves around this crazy woman , but in the end we get more clarity over life and relationships , which is good.I can 't tell if the acting was bad .

" Okay , I grew up on Who , but haven 't loved a Doctor since Tom Baker . Christopher Eccleston made me love Who again and I 'll be furious with him forever for leaving . The writing is grand , the acting superb , the directing ( which was dreadful in the old days ) is just fantastic . I was very skeptical about this programme , and watched it merely out of being forced , but am now a huge fan and love it ( I have a ringtone of a Dalek screaming " " Exterminate " " then ) . A few of the things I love about the new programme -- 1 ) people actually notice when Rose ( Billie Piper ) disappears off the planet . Some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while , and then come home like nothing has happened , no one noticed . 2 ) Chris Eccleston 's doc loves Rose -- romantic or not will be debated , but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion . He 'd destroy the world if he had to to save her , which the old show was lacking -- often a doctor wouldn 't care if he never saw his assistants again . 3 ) They talk and think like real people -- when Rose is shown something outlandish or new ( such as aliens ) she acts like a real person would -- gobsmacked . I never liked it when an assistant from the old show , who never saw anything alien , would just fit right in and adapt instantly . I want to see the surprise on Rose 's face when she sees a plastic dummy come to life . She gives that to me . The few things I don 't like about this series : 1 ) nearly everything happens on earth ( London or Cardiff ) and I was sort of hoping for a more off-world sort of show . 2 ) That Eccleston left so quickly , he really made the show brilliant . But I can let those few things go -- I far more enjoy the series than I ever expected to , so I don 't mind if they have stuff set on earth . Just don 't take this show seriously -- it 's fun , it 's smart , it 's entertaining , but it 's not a super-serious heavy duty show . It 's pure fun , and pure British , and I can 't get enough . Watch it with an open mind , and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy ! ps -- don 't watch series 2 or later. series 1 was brilliant , the first few episodes of series 2 were good , but don 't watch it once it gets to Love and Monsters . Utter rubbish , completely destroys the show . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the Native American residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo ...

There were even buffalo killing contests ... " " Buffalo " " Bill Cody killed thousands of buffalo ... Some U. S. government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds ... The buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting ... Few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once-great bison herds ... " " The Last Hunt " " holds one of Robert Taylor 's most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept Taylor as a heavy guy ...

" Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival , over three years ago . I went in with no expectations since Christopher Nolan was a no-name at the time , but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival . It worked well on the big screen , with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood . Mr.Nolan gave a good account of its making at the end , enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker !

" I am a huge fan of big , loud , trashy , completely stupid action movies such as The Rock , Con Air etc . All of these are great fun to watch but , when you think about it , extremely silly . IN THE LINE OF FIRE tells a story and it tells it well . With plausibility as well as excitement and suspense it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think . The last shot of the movie is Eastwood and Russo sitting together on the steps of the White house watching the pigeons to gentle , peaceful music and I felt a deep feeling of satisfaction . This was because I cared about the characters and I was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion . It felt like a true story . As the aging secret service agent tormented by the fact that he failed to protect JFK on that fateful day in Dallas , Clint Eastwood is fantastic . He brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his adversary . On the other side of the spectrum is John Malkovich , as the creepy predator who tortures Eastwood about what happened in 1963 by openly telling him of his plan to kill the current president . This Oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin . Throughout the movie , Malkovich talks to Eastwood as if they are friends . He doesn 't threaten him , he doesn 't lie to him , he doesn 't laugh at him , but he tortures him with his unbearable friendliness right up to the last moment . As well as this thrilling main plot , there is a charming love story involving Rene Russo , another agent and Eastwood . Despite the age difference , they have superb chemistry on screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much but keeps it as part of the backdrop which works nicely . To sum up , I love this film because it has a mind . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game . When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a ' full ride ' scholarship if he plays well.All too often , these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen . FULL RIDE 's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile , but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre . Matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager , both over-confident and vulnerable , optimistic and cynical by turns . Influenced by Amy , Matt grows into a man of character and heart . He , in turn , forms friendships with his teammates , which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player.FULL RIDE has all the elements we love to see in a movie--great acting , admirable characters , exciting sports scenes , poignant drama , and a love story . Still , while one may have seen these elements in other films , FULL RIDE is assisted by performances that are sincere and occasionally , even moving . Perhaps what 's most impressive about FULL RIDE is its sense of reality . Although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree , ( clearly a disgruntled student who , for quite obvious reasons , received a poor grade in his film class ) director Mark Hoeger grounds the film in a believable situation and location and does a great job of getting down to the grit of what life is like in a small town . These characters are real people rooted in realistic situations , which often create the most compelling entertainment . On one level it is a love story , on another it is a character study , and yet another it is a simple football film . All of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Many consider BEAST STABLE to be the last of the " " true " " FEMALE PRISONER films , as it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito , and is followed by one other film ( GRUDGE SONG ) by a different director . I have not seen GRUDGE SONG yet ( but soon will ... ) so I don 't know how it stacks up to the previous FP films - but it will be interesting to see . The way BEAST STABLE ended didn 't really leave a lot of room for another predecessor - but I guess I 'll find out ... This entry has Scorpion on the run from the cops , where she hooks up with a street-hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded brothers child ( oh yeah - that 's no lie ... gotta love these sleazy story lines ) . Scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival , but ( as she is so good at ... ) ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people that wronged a few of her hooker friends ... I agree with some other reviewers , that this one is a little slower at points and more " " serious " " then the previous two entries . The story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times , but a lot of these 70 's era pinky films are - and I still love them . BEAST STABLE is lacking pretty badly in the nudity area which was pretty disappointing - but I thought it strong in other areas - storyline , cinematography , some good sleaze , etc ... Definitely worthwhile to fans of this sort of thing , or who have enjoyed the other FEMALE PRISONER films ... 8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I am afraid I will have to add my name to the long list of people who remain flabbergasted that this film has STILL not ( sept 2007 ) been issued on DVD . It 's one of those mysteries that makes the mind boggle , especially when you consider the amount of DVD 's available today containing material that should have been binned years ago . Still I have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo so my qualm is more one of principle than a frustration at not being able to view the film . As to the film itself , this is an excellent all-rounder with good picture quality , more than satisfactory soundtrack , lively plot involving suspense , emotion , sadness , frustration , feeling good and exotic surroundings ( for a European ) . How true the film fits in with the reality in Burma I have no idea , indeed , that is less important , the essential thing is that entertainment-wise , it is a success . One soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and I admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing-the-river scene . It 's a shame we hear so little about countries such as Burma and this film at least gives some insight into the country . Has the situation changed since 1995 ? The events which are to occur later this month seem to answer this question with a resounding " " No " " and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever , not even sparing the lives of monks , let alone women or children ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD . The acting throughout is excellent - no question . There was not quite enough action for me I must say . No real suspense as such , just plenty of first class character development . Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of " " whodunnit " . " If you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you . Peter Egan as the lead Magnus Pym is excellent.The film portrayed the life of a traitor . A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things . As a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time & time again as a crook and a con man . Pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him ( wife , son , mentor ) . Pym is fatally damaged by his father 's influence - it has eaten his moral fibre away . He has no real love or loyalty in him.Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series . Very well done though . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Like TALK RADIO , THE BOOTH is actually kinda predictable ( TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened going in , THE BOOTH because of- let 's face it- the genre and the basic set-up ) . That 's not necessarily a bad thing , in this case . It means , in essence , that the filmmakers don 't punk out in the end the way they might 've in , say , an American version of this story . THE BOOTH moves inexorably toward its ( foregone ) conclusion , but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of ( very scenic ) road . It reminds me of Harlan Ellison 's spooky short story , FLOP SWEAT . The claustrophobia is , at times , almost palpable . Worth a nice long look . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man ( which more or less takes place in the desert ) . It also models some of the bizarre humor ( and especially eccentric trail of characters ) of writer Joseph Minion 's comedy , ' After Hours . ' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy , a metaphor of temptation and redemption , Gus ( played well by Jordan Christopher Michael ) , a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank , steals a Mustang , and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents . It begins as a trip through salvation ( which is apparent in the scenes with John Diehl ) , but once he becomes hooked on a scratch-off game called Motorama , he becomes easily tainted by temptation and looses his childish innocence . He travels from one crazy fictional state to another concocting ways of getting Motorama cards from participating gas stations , just enough so that he might spell out the prize winning word M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A and be eligible for the $ 500 million cash prize.Along the way , he is embattled with dozens of strange characters such as Flea who plays a high strung busboy , Meatloaf who plays a crazy biker , and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron ( a Seinfeld regular ) as two violent kidnappers . The DVD rerelease can be very deceptive , as have previous attempts to sell this film to the non-cult market first with taglines comparing it to Home Alone and Thelma & Louise . The newest calling it a love story with the tagline implying that the film is about Jordan Michael Christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams ... which , despite the size of her picture on the DVD cover , is actually only about a 1 second cameo by Drew Barrymore as the fantasy girl that Gus dreams about . Why didn 't they just market it for what it was ? Thought it may seem totally bizarre on first viewing , it is actually a well-designed narrative . Motorama is great material for fans of strange b-grade comedies . This was quite an interesting story , and particularly because of the strength of its lead actor--Jordan Michael Christopher ( who unfortunately has few other screen credits of note ) --and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot . Hopefully its re-release on DVD will make it an easier find for cult fans . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart ( excluding the few days Mann worked on Night Passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances ) , The Far Country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption , fighting it every step of the way . This time he 's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by John McIntire 's larcenous judge of the Roy Bean school of law and order . Stealing them back and taking them across the Canadian border , he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims ... While it 's no great surprise which way Stewart turns at the end , he 's a surprisingly callous critter along the way , even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it 's not his problem . For most of the film there 's really only a hair 's breadth between him and McIntire , something the judge recognises immediately , revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he 's genially planning to lynch him . In many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too - despite their appeals to his dead-and-buried better nature , there 's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he is.As usual with Mann there 's an exceptional use of high country locations , though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground , and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from Walter Brennan , Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman ( though Corinne Calvert 's young romantic interest veers to the irritating ) . Sadly the great cinematography of the Canadian Rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average DVD transfer , with only the theatrical trailer as an extra . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Let me just start out by saying that Tourist Trap is a better movie then 99.9 % of the horror films that have come out of Hollywood lately . If you don 't believe me see Darkness Falls or They . And it is certainly better than any of those crappy direct to video releases like Stab , Bleed , The Pool , and so on . One of the big problems with the film Tourist Trap is that is never really found an audience . When the film opened in 1979 it was given a PG rating by the MPAA . Anyone that knows horror films knows that a PG on a horror film is usually the kiss of death for the film . ( Director David Schmoeller talks about this problem on the DVD 's commentary track . ) There are exceptions though like Poltergeist , which had also received a PG rating . However , there are big differences between Tourist Trap and Poltergeist . Tourist Trap was not a big budget Hollywood film like Poltergeist nor was it produced by Steven Spielberg . That alone was enough to guarantee Poltergeist success . ( Still for those of you that have seen Tourist Trap , you will even scratch your head as to why the MPAA rated this film PG . The ' heart burst ' scene alone should be enough for the film to be slapped with and R rating . Or how about the pipe in the back with the blood running out of it . ) I have to admit though that when I was young I looked at a copy of Poltergeist in the video store shelf , picked it up , saw that it was rated PG and put it back on the shelf in favor of an R rated film instead . Years later , I finally saw Poltergeist and realized what a great film I missed out on for not renting a PG horror film . From then on I would never judge a film based on it 's rating again . This is most likely what happened to Tourist Trap . People , like me with Poltergeist , will probably overlook it in favor of the R rated film . Most likely it would be a teenager too , which most of these types of films are targeted at . Friday the 13th was no masterpiece either but did extremely well at the box office due to the fact it was rated R and was heavily advertised by Paramount at the time . It found its audience and made enough money to spawn several sequels . When you look at it folks , Tourist Trap is just as good as Friday The 13th . The same thing could 've happened to Tourist Trap . We could have seen Tourist Trap 2 , 3 , 4 , and so on . As far as the film goes , Tourist Trap is an entertaining horror film made on an extremely small budget , but it is well acted , well directed and well made on many levels . Chuck Connors is a riot as Mr. Slausen and gives the best performance in the film . Special credit must be give to composer Pino Donaggio , whose score for this film really is what sets it apart from others and gives it its creepiness . The music in the scenes involving the mannequins is especially creepy . Donaggio worked on the horror film Carrie and many other film scores since Tourist Trap . He has done exceptionally good work in film and continues to score films to this day . The weakness with Tourist Trap is that there really is never any explanation of Davey 's powers . Maybe that is how it 's supposed to be . He just has them , and we should accept that in order for the movie to work . We do accept it to a point , but then the screenplay has incidents like how Davey makes the phone ring in the store while he 's in the basement of the house . In that case , is Davey limited in using his powers ? Can he make a phone ring in Houston , Detroit , Los Angeles ? What is his range ? Those are things that people that didn 't care for this movie would most likely to point out as flaws . Others would accept it as a mistake . I accept it . There is not enough of those type of questions generated by this film to make me hate it . This is a horror film . We should not be required to read too much into it . Many people have called this the ' killer mannequin ' movie . I assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this film . The mannequins are controlled by the power of Davey who uses them as a weapon . This is a common misconception about this film . Some people have a problem with the mannequins and some have even said they are just downright silly . I think they add to the overall creepiness of the film . Overall Tourist Trap is a good fun rental . * * * ( out of 5 ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Two people living in the same flat complex find their partners are having an affair with each other . As they try and piece together how it happened , they also embark on an emotional journey that aches for a resolution혚Building on his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express , Wong Kar Wai gives us this rather old fashioned and marvellous story of reawakened passions , yearning and unrequited love . Possibly , In the Mood for Love is not to everyone 's taste . It wanders in rather lazily at 98mins : not particularly long for a film , but it appears longer because not a lot really happens . But this lazy feel conceals a quite tightly constructed film . Most of the story is cunningly woven around a series of set piece role plays , where the characters act out presumed scenarios between their respective spouses , trying to work out how the affair started . I say cunning because , of course , this makes it difficult for the audience ( and the characters ) to tell what is " " in-role " " and what is genuine . If all this sounds rather arty and self-conscience , that 's because it is . Unashamedly so . And it is played to perfection by two of Hong Kong 's finest , Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai , with some excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan.It is also a virtuoso performance by Wong Kar Wai , who treats the audience to a sensory , and sensual , overload . Bringing together Christopher Doyle ( who later deployed his lush , over-ripe style on Hero ) and Pin Bing Lee ( whose beautifully understated style can be seen on Springtime in a Small Town ) was cinematographic genius . It has all the bold beauty of Doyle , without , frankly , the Athena-poster cheesiness of his work on Hero . The music , as always with Wong , is prominent . From Nat King Cole singing in Spanish , to the haunting strings of the main theme , it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images . All in all a top film , whether judged on plot , acting , cinematography or soundtrack . Similar to , but more accessible than , Wim Wenders ' Wings of Desire , this is a beautiful , old fashioned story about love lost and regained . And watch out for Tony Leung 's hotel room 2046 , which presaged Wong 's recent film of the same name . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of the best episode from the second season of MOH , I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He kill 'em all , they are often the victims ( Screwfly solution , Pro-life , Valerie on the stairs , I don 't remember the Argento 's episode in season 1 , etc . , obviously Imprint ) . I think he enjoys to watch women been burn , torture , mutilated and I don 't know . Never least " " Right to die " " is one of the best , with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense ( specially with the photos from the cell scene , wonderful ) . The acting is like the entire series , regular I could be worst like " " Pro-life " " or " " We scream for Ice cream " . " Also I think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode . The ideology of the series is horrible , killing and terminating women , mutilating animals and on and on ... the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like " " Cigarrette burns " " ( The best of all ) , " " Homecoming " " ( The most funny ) , " " Imprint " " ( really shocking ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I gather at least a few people watched it on Sept.2 on TCM . If you did you know that Hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the U.S. It was a huge scandal and I gather that the original release in the U.S. was so chopped up by censors that it was practically unintelligible . I watched because I had just seen a documentary on " " bad women " , " actresses in the U.S. pre- movie censorship board set up in the early ' 30s . It looked to me as though they got away with a lot more than Hedy 's most " " sensational " " shots in " " Ecstasy " . " In fact Hedy looked positively innocent in this , by today 's standards , and it was nice to see her early unspoiled beauty . It was a nice , lyrical movie to relax to . I loved it for what it was : a simple romance . I watched it after pre- recording it during a sleepless early A.M.

" I have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie I was basically lost . There had been some mildly amusing humour , but at best a barebones plot and a general sense of pointlessness that was on the verge of making me think that I was wasting my time . Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I was enjoying this . There was no blinding moment of realization and no suddenly dramatic scene that grabbed me . In fact nothing very exciting happens in the entire movie . It was as if I just all of a sudden realized that the movie was meant to be largely pointless - and that in its very pointlessness was its charm.Morgan Freeman starred as an unnamed actor who finds a ? 쐋ittle project ? ? to jumpstart his career . He 's going to play a supermarket manager , and spends the day in a neighbourhood supermarket to research the role . While there he meets and bonds with Scarlet ( played by Paz Vega ) - a cashier who wants more out of life . He helps her prepare for a job interview as if she 's auditioning for a role , while she introduces him to real life . It 's truly funny watching ? 쐆im ? ? ( for that 's how the character is identified in the credits ) be overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target store.Freeman and Vega were great together , with a strange but completely believable sort of combined romantic but father-daughter chemistry . If you feel lost at the beginning , stick with this . In the end , it turns out to be a delightfully charming movie . 7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years . Many of his stories have been adapted to screen . Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor . The older brother , Pete Greer , goes to Memphis , Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men , some who would never come home . His younger brother doesn 't take his departure well . He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother . He surprisingly becomes a soldier of another kind since he wants to enlist also at 10 years old . Ron Perlman does a surprising performance as the military leader who manages to take care and bond with the boy . This short film won an Oscar for Best Short-Live Action film which is well-deserved . If it was longer , it could compete with the longer films . Everything else like costumes , art direction , and recreating the era of America in 1941 is perfect . The film also shows the heartbreaking war at home as most Americans were surviving the great depression . The actors and actresses are not known but they do a first rate performances . If Hollywood would make more quality films , I would probably go to the cinema more . If Broadway had more quality shows , I would go to the theater more . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First of all i 'd just like to say this movie rawked more than any of the recent crap that hollywood has cooked up out of its bowels . McBain is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle . It has all of the classic elements of a late 80 's / early 90 's action film .... the random gratuitous acts of violence ( ie. when Walken and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money ) , the snapping of necks , the guys on fire , the guys that get blown off buildings , and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings . Walken is at his finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as , " " let 's go sit .......... out on the deck . " " and others that make this film a top buy off of the clearence rack at the local video store. if you have a bloodlust for unnecessary random acts of violence rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Happiest Days of Your Life showcases some of Britain 's greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditionally farcical and upper-class-twit like fashion . Generally it is a whistle-stop tour of stuffy English behaviour with the girls-only school providing a great setting for the dotty goings-on . Margaret Rutherford , Alastair Sim and - most especially ! - Joyce Grenfell are all fantastic , giving us a lot of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with . As the film moves on , things get sillier and sillier with the tour around the school for the parents being a suitably crackers high point.At this point I will give special mention , again , to Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gossage . She is so extraordinarily innocent , silly , apologetic and ineffectual that she seems to steal the whole film . She provides the greatest laugh of the film when she flirts with a male teacher ( " " Call me sausage ! " " ) .Whilst some of the film is slow or dated , and not always very involving , it still maintains most of its sparkle and barely pauses for romance . Good for a silly , harmless giggle.7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The message that the director was trying to get across ( which is THE important thing , not how the characters dressed ! ) definitely got through . The theme of having the main characters involved in illegal drag racing was a good idea , too ( cool muscle cars , btw ) .

" An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly . Watch as Gene sings , acts and dances his way through Paris in any number of situations . Some purely majestic , others pure corn . One can imagine just what Kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before " " Singin ' In The Rain " . " He is definately one of the all time greats . It is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films , especially in Kelly 's characters , the only main difference being that one is based in Paris , the other in L.A.Some have said that Leslie Caron 's acting was less than pure . Perhaps Cyd Charisse , who was originally intended for the role could have done better , however Caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with Kelly . Oscar Levant 's short role in this film gave it just what it needed , someone who doesn 't look like Gene Kelly . Filling the role as the everyman isn 't an easy task , yet Levant did it with as much class as any other lead.The song and dance routines are all perfection . Even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without . Seeing that there really wasn 't much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable , Minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you 'd spent four hours with them . Ingenious ! I would have to rate this film up with Singin ' since it is very similar in story and song . Singin ' would barely get the nod because of Debbie Reynolds uplifting performance.Full recommendation.8 / 10 stars . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Story says that on that on December 28 , 1895 , a small group of thirty-three people was gathered at Paris 's Salon Indien Du Grand Caf챕 to witness the Cin챕matographe , a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named August and Louis Lumi챔re . The small audience reunited that day ( some by invitation , most due to curiosity ) didn 't really know what to expect from the show , and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen , most thought that the Cin챕matographe was just another fancy devise to present slide-show projections . Until the photograph started to move . What those thirty-three people experienced in awe that cold day of December was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen ; history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day.Of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day , " " La Sortie Des Usines Lumi챔re " " ( literally " " Exiting the Lumi챔re Factory " " ) was the very first to be screened . The film shows the many workers of the Lumi챔re factory as they walk through the gates of the factory , leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work . While a very basic " " actuality film " " ( movie depicting a real event ) , the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise , as their concept of moving pictures was limited to Edison 's " " Peep Show " " machines ( the Kinetoscope ) , the brothers ' invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe , as the people and the horses moved across the screen . The idea wasn 't entirely new ( Le Prince shot the first movie as early as 1888 ) , but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary . " " La Sortie Des Usines Lumi챔re " " would become the first in the long series of " " actuality films " " that the Lumi챔re would produce over the years . This primitive form of documentary was the brothers ' favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the Cin챕matographe could have . Despite the initial lack of enthusiasm , after the first showing the Cin챕matographe became a great success and " " La Sortie Des Usines Lumi챔re " " quickly became an iconic image of that first screening . It definitely wasn 't the first movie the brothers shot that year , and it probably wasn 't the best of the 10 movies shown that day ( personally I think that " " L ' Arroseur Arros챕 " " was the best of the 10 ) ; however , it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates , as literally , this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it . 8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I found it hard to like anyone in this film . The central characters , Lindy and Michael Chamberlain , whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback , are not bad people , but then surely not all , or even most , of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better . But though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the Chamberlains from the start of their life 's tragic disarray , the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip , news media , crowds , mobs and assumptions . It 's not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular ; it 's merely an account of a true story that happened there . Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.When a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine 's dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog , when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines , newspapers and TV programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy , there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one 's own unaware perceptions , influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one 's life . The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out , from the victims to the masses.The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside , suspicion was jet-fueled mostly by a virtue of hers . To the public eye , she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter . Why was she able to keep her cool , even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up , for TV and the press ? How much of the downward spiral could 've been prevented had she behaved more to the public 's liking in the media ? Meryl Streep , one of , if not the , greatest actress working today , may not give a performance that particularly stands out , and frankly neither does any other actor , or department of film-making . But she , and the screenwriters , do understand Lindy . What is infuriating is that it 's not that difficult . Apparently , she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case . Whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense , we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation.Whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as Sophie 's Choice , The Devil Wears Prada , Angels In America or other such work , it is a triumph . It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself . She frustrates us because we don 't know what she 's thinking or feeling . It took me awhile to feel endeared toward her , but this is the movie 's way of suggesting the reaction of the public 's attention.She is married to a pastor , and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most . Initially , they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to God 's will , kick-starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter 's death was some sort of ritual killing on their part . Whatever happened to the little girl , her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media 's intake didn 't immediately identify , so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry ... well ... Meryl Streep and Sam Neill are constantly on screen , but the Australian public plays the real leads here . Like punctuation for each plot advance , director Fred Schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office , where the public tries Lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections.This Golan-Globus docudrama is not particularly memorable . The setting 's atmosphere doesn 't give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out . But it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham , AL , which was actually a really fun festival , and was blown away by it . It was the best movie I saw all day by a long shot . A school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together . It 's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality .

" After stabbing a retarded boy , the fifteen years old troubled and pessimist Leland P. Fitzgerald ( Ryan Gosling ) is sent to a juvenile detention . His teacher and aspirant writer Pearl Madison ( Don Cheadle ) gets close and tries to understand him , first with intention of writing a book , and later becoming his friend . Leland slowly discloses his sad vision of world , showing that he is a sociopath . " " The United States of Leland " " is a depressive and interesting study of a character . The low paced riveting screenplay discloses pieces of the story like a puzzle ; there are excellent lines and dialogs ; the performances are great , although the twenty-three years old Ryan Gosling does not convince as a fifteen years old teenager ; but it seems that a part is missing to complete the puzzle and make " " The United States of Leland " " an unforgettable movie . The disappointing clarification of the " " why " " for the violent action of Leland against Ryan Pollard is not convincing or touching , indeed shows that this character is a totally deranged sociopath with a weird and sick sight of world . Further , the way Allen Harris gets Pearl 's knife is ridiculous . My vote is seven.Title ( Brazil ) : " " O Mundo de Leland " " ( " " The World of Leland " " ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I had the TV on for a white noise companion and heard " " $ 400 for a fully furnished apartment " " So I ran into the TV room expecting another 70 's flick and got much more . Luckily , I could rewind to the beginning ( DVR buffer ) and hit the record button to watch it entirely . ( Cinemax uncut and in HD no less ! ) Aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog / events , this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch . Pretty creepy and progressive at times : Beverly D 'Angelo 's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker , played adroitly by Cristina Raines , Parker stabs , in very gory fashion , her father , an explicit menage a trios scene . ( don 't let the kids watch ) The film is TOTALLY 70 's full of bad clothes ( polyester suits and tacky ascots ) and decor , bad hair , over bloated music score , and familiar looking cinematography . The cast is excellent , take a second on this film 's home page to check it out.It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken , Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young .

" This is the essence of the early eighties ! The malls , the credit card machines , the food , the punk hair color , the soundtrack ... I am in love with this movie .

" I had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical Genre Hollywood film . Story lines fail , and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste . But , then I saw Zentropa ( Europa ) and my faith was renewed . Not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating . The narrator ( Max Von Sydow ) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into Europa 1945 . We have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow-moving moment that leads you to death . Unlike many films it doesn 't cut after one second of showing ( for example ) a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man 's final moments . I think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means . I would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email . Enjoy it ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I first viewed the trailer , I have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection . But after hearing about it , I decided to buy it . When I bought the entire collection in a box set , it was absolutely what I wanted to see . It was very funny , and the characters were pretty cool . Favorite characters in the show are : Marion , Carrot , the Haze Knights , Big Momma , and Dotta . I also liked the opening and ending theme songs . The show also has some great voice talents from Tiffany Grant , Jason Douglas , and others . But however , this show is one of the greatest . So if you want to see something cool .

" Robert Cummings , Laraine Day and Jean Muir star in " " And One Was Beautiful , " " a 1940 film also starring Billie Burke . At one hour and 15 minutes , this looks to have been a B movie . Cummings is a playboy , Ridley Crane , whom many women desire , including two sisters , Katherine and Helen Latimer ( Day and Muir ) . Katherine is the more earthbound of the two who likes to fix cars , and Helen is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful gowns . Ridley arrives back in town , and , believing he 's not going to be at a party , Helen decides not to attend . Since the party is given by a family friend , their mother ( Burke ) sends Katherine in a pinned up dress . Ridley is there , and the two connect . But Ridley is into more superficiality , and when he sees Helen at a dinner party , the two pick up where they left off and go to a club . He becomes terribly drunk , and Helen at first refuses to ride in his car because he won 't let her drive . After walking awhile and breaking the heel of her shoe , she gets into Ridley 's car when he drives by . He passes out , and she takes over the wheel , accidentally hitting and killing a bicyclist.Ridley can 't remember anything , so Helen lets him take the blame for the death . The heel of a woman 's shoe is found in the car , and Katherine sees her sister bury her shoes - plus , something in Helen 's manner makes her realize that Helen isn 't telling the truth . Ridley is convicted and goes to prison , and Helen marries a man she doesn 't love and leaves for South America.This is a wonderful film , even though at the time , this wasn 't an A-list cast . Cummings is playing a part that Robert Taylor would have played ( it 's an MGM film ) - he 's handsome and very amiable , even if he doesn 't have the dazzling looks of someone like Taylor . Laraine Day is a favorite actress of mine , someone MGM loaned out constantly because they didn 't know what to do with her . Why , I wonder - a wonderful actress with a great face and voice , she livened up many a film . This one is no different . Her Katherine is determined , sympathetic and totally lovely . Jean Muir is a lousy actress.So who was the beautiful one ? We all know even if MGM didn 't.Highly recommended little gem . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Excellent plot line makes this movie one of the classic , cult ninja flicks of all time . The plot being that this woman 's soul is possessed by an evil ninja spirit . I mean to be honest if i could obtain ninja ability through possession I would . Furthermore , for being in the 80 's and such the fact that the ninja aspect was far greater in this particular decade is evident and despite all that , Ninja 3 The Domination manages to keep it original from the American Ninja cookie cutter molds that plagued the 80 's for so long .

" Says Andy : " " Nobody gets hurt , everybody wins . " " Before he says it , we know the opposite is true : Everybody gets hurt , nobody wins . This is a new strand in American movies , or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last . Think " " Eastern Promises " , " " " There Will Be Blood " , " " " No Country for Old Men " . " These movies are dark , serious , extremely well made , and don 't care about happy endings . I love them . " " Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " " fits the general description , but creates an atmosphere all its own . Kelly Masterson 's debut script is as close as a Hollywood movie will ever get to a Greek tragedy . Paying tribute to fellow veteran director Stanley Donen , Sidney Lumet expertly and soberly turns the sombre story into an outstanding , old school character drama . The opening shots , although of an obese accountant doggy-styling his trophy wife , have the look and feel of a Dutch master 's painting . By contrast , the drug dealer 's condo looks more like a string of Mondrians . Great performances all around . Only Albert Finney 's character Charles feels a little over-acted , eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time . But then he is in trouble deep , deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know . For compensation , Marisa Tomei is super hot . But of course you don 't need me to tell you that . Why her character Gina would want to be with a guy like Andy , we 're never told , but that 's okay . Action is character , after all .

" This film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever . Ever . But in my opinion it is possibly the funniest . The horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless . I bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain DVD 's at my local pound shop . Me and some friends then watched it , admittedly whilst rather drunk . It soon occurred that this wasn 't any normal film . Instead a priceless relic of what will probably be James Cahill 's last film . At first we were confused and were screaming for the DVD player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no-one could be bothered . Instead we watched the film right through . At the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream , something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours , whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons . We soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed , this wasn 't a work of abysmal film . This was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at . This was a film that anyone can enjoy .

" I don 't watch soaps . My grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass . I made fun of them it when I was ten ( it was so easy ) .But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way . I found the story pretty damn funny . The fashions of the 80 's - shoulder pads , sequins , and polyester - just top it off . The huge hair , the high heels , and the histrionics - what a combination.And all the actors just go to town , chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile . Sally , Kevin , Elisabeth - wonderful ! Whoopi - great ! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such potential , before the tabloids . And Garry : why did we have to wait so long to see him on film ? Leesa Gibbons - hadn 't been missing her , but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter ( and where do you apply for THAT job , anyway ? ) .Admittedly , I could have done without Sally climbing the drainpipe . Lucy Ricardo did it , how many times ? , as has every comedienne from Carol Burnett to I don 't know who and I 'm so done with it now , I could spit peanuts if I had them . Apparently it 's what you do when you 're being funny in a tall building in New York . I 'm just thankful they didn 't pull out the flagpole bit.But it was cute , it was funny , it had plot twists , it had an after credits ending before that was common , it had clothes worthy of a second glance , it had a great cast and it 's got personal memories for me .

" The marriage of an upscale New York City couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out ( " " It took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door ! " " a neighbor tells us ) ; the busy , distracted husband takes on the " " motherly " " responsibilities and grows closer to his son , but soon the wife returns . Highly manipulative picture doesn 't give us a very realistic familial unit ( with young Justin Henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep ! ) , but the dynamics are intriguing and involving , and director Robert Benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness , marvelous classical music , canny editing and surefire bits of humor . Streep 's character is designed to be a cold , self-centered witch , but I was ready to feel a lot more for her than Benton probably wanted . It all has to be painted in terms of black and white , good and bad , with Hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent . The film never falters from its preconceived path , and very fine acting nearly saves it , but I 'm not sure where Benton was steering the film in the final act , and the closing scene is awfully abrupt . * * * from * * * * , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS , and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE , director John Boorman delivers an effective film about Man 's violent side in DELIVERANCE , arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s . Burt Reynolds , Jon Voight , Ned Beatty , and Ronny Cox portray four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before it is dammed up into what Reynolds calls " " one big , dead lake . " " But the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these " " city boys " " carousing through their woods . And the following day , continuing on down the river , Beatty and Voight are accosted and sexually assaulted ( the film 's infamous " " SQUEAL ! " " sequence ) by two vicious mountain men ( Bill McKinney , Herbert " " Cowboy " " Coward ) . Thus , what started out as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism.James Dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book , and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker . Often known for its " " SQUEAL ! " " and " " Dueling Banjos " " sequences , DELIVERANCE is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal , with the four leading men superb in their roles , and McKinney and Coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times . A must-see film for those willing to take a chance . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Opera opens with a very close-up shot of a bird 's ever-watching eye and thus begins one of Argento 's most bizarre , and enjoyable , features ( my second favorite in fact , behind Deep Red ) . Granted , at times , the movie is pretty absurd ( the lack of real concern after murders , the bird attack , the burnt dummy , that ending혚 ) but this is Argento 's fantastical world and once you come to terms with that , you 'll find that it works . I do not mean to completely dismiss these faults though , rather that the artistry of the film more than makes up for them . For example , the aforementioned bird attack is completely over-the-top in theory , yet look at the wonderful execution of it ; crows flying in chaos , adding their enraged squawking to the driving rock beat , the crowd in panic as seen through the circling , bird 's-eye view camera-work , and then the focused attack ; aria of terror indeed . Argento 's amazing , flowing cinematography is on full display in Opera , and clearly one of the film 's highlights . I also enjoyed the soundtrack of operatic themes and rock music , a nice contrast of music with each used effectively ( the rock kicks in with the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very frenzied feel ) . The sound effects deserve a nod too , stabs , scissors , beaks , and all.Inspector Alan Santini : " " I 've seen a lot of your movies . Yes , you 're really an expert in this field . I 'd be very interested to know your opinion . " " Marco : " " I think it 's unwise to use movies as a guide for reality , don 't you inspector ? " " Inspector Alan Santini : " " Depends what you mean by reality . " " Being that this is a giallo , stylish murders are a must and Dario does not disappoint ( the " " bullet through the door " " scene is quite possibly one of the greatest deaths ever shot , if you 'll forgive the pun ) . The black-gloved , deep-voiced , pulsating brained ( cool shots ! ) killer is cold and brutal , and having him tape pins under our heroine 's eyes so that she was forced to watch the murders was a nice touch . That all said , as a giallo , Opera doesn 't quite have as good of a mystery as it should . The killer is kept secret from the audience well enough but there 's little effort in the film devoted to actually solving the murders . This , and the strange ending , could 've used more work . Despite these problems though , Opera still manages to be a worthwhile and satisfying horror film.One final note : it was nice to see a movie , for once , show the correct view through binoculars ( just a circle , not two circles together ) ! Nice eye for detail , Dario ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My family truly enjoyed this movie . As far as what this movie will do for Rugby in the USA ... well I am sure that will be debatable . But as for me and others around me , I know that we were more curious about the sport after seeing the movie and I personally gained more respect for the game . You may wonder how this possible , especially since the movie does not dive in and explain Rugby . But the simple fact is it drew you into the players and emotion of the game and life . The film was inspirational as well as entertaining . It made us laugh and cry . The chemistry between Sean Astin , Big Budah and Sean Faris worked well . Some may think the movie is a little clich챕 , but I seriously wish Hollywood made more movies like this . I couldn 't help drawing analogies of the game and life 's struggles . At the end of it I found myself examining my own life to see what I needed to do better , in order to be the best person I could be .

" I have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture , i 'm white and like classic rock , however , that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy . Its pretty much a sequel of This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it is the same movie , just about rap instead or rock . Yet it 's hilarious . There are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat . The characters are all very funny and believable . I watched just because it made me laugh at 3 a.m. , and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening . One of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different . Rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent . This movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit . Overall , it 's a funny movie with many jokes about racism , sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor .

" Joseph L. Mankiewicz 's Sleuth didn 't need a remake . It 's a thoroughly well made film that stands up well to this day . However , given that the modern day remake machine is currently in full swing ; I really can 't say I 'm surprised to see the film updated for modern audience . The plot remains identical to the original film and at its core we have the story of a young man , Milo Tindle , who goes off to see an older man , Andrew Wyke , to discuss a divorce as the younger man is having an affair with the older man 's wife . From there , a game of cat and mouse ensues . Its clear right from the outset that director Kenneth Branagh wanted to add a different touch to this film and he does so by way of the central location , which has been changed from the charming games-ridden country house of the original to a technical marvel kitted out with layers of security equipment . I 'm glad that the director chose to make this change as nobody wants to see a remake that directly copies of the original ; plus there 's the fact that the location is well used and always nice to look at . Unfortunately , however , the positive elements of Sleuth 2007 end there.The original film was over two hours long , while this remake is only just a shade over eighty minutes . Naturally , therefore , that means that this version has less about it ; and unfortunately it 's the characters that suffer . The plot is also rushed and we get into the first twist in the tale far too quickly and before we are given any chance to actually understand why and how these events can be taking place . The film does not build the characters , or the rapport between them , enough to make sure that their relationship makes sense . One major thing that has been changed about the older character is his obsession ; in the original he was obsessed with games which turned out to be VERY important once the twists come into play . Here he has some kind of security fetish that doesn 't really mean anything by the end . Kenneth Branagh 's handling of the film allows for a classy score but the class ends there . The original thrived on it , but this film is happy merely to soil itself with expletives on numerous , and mostly unwarranted , occasions ; which cheapen the whole thing . The final twist in the tale is completely different to how it was in the original and ensures that the film boils down to a really hideous conclusion . After spending two hours with the original I understood , respected and liked both characters presented in the film - after eighty minutes of this , I hated them both . I do have some respect for Branagh for not merely rolling out a carbon copy of the original film ; but this is not a good adaptation of the great Anthony Shaffer play . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" an awesome made for the sci-fi channel movie which by far surpasses many of the poor previous efforts they 've churned out . Bruce Campbell is on superb form as a possible investor who gets caught up in a bizarre experiment led by a delirious professor , Stacey Keach , and his half-wit assistance , Ted Raimi . The film is pure b movie gold and its great to see Keach and ram up on screen with Bruce , and the fact that a lot of the film works purely on Bruce 's comic slapstick acting is what make it hilarious , and makes me ask the question , why isn 't this guy getting more of his scripts commissioned ? , it indeed a sick world .

" Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made ! If you love Bringing Up Baby , The Philadelpia Story , The Thin Man , I Was A Male War Bride or It 's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit , taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek , check this one out . Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed.Grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire . Loy is adorable as his pre-NOW wife . The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can 't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker .

" Soylent Green is a classic . I have been waiting for someone to re-do it.They seem to be remaking sci-fi classics these days ( i.e. War of the Worlds ) and I am hoping some director / producer will re-do Soylent Green . With todays computer animation and technology , it would have the potential to be a great picture . Anti-Utopian films may not be that far-fetched . The human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it . We , as humans , have the option of putting the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species if they get out of hand , but there 's nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves . Despite all the diseases , wars , abortions , birth control , etc. the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish . Classic Malthusian economics states that any species , including humans , will multiply beyond their means of subsistence . 6 billion and growing .... that 's obscene . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" ------ Spoilers----- Spoilers----- Spoilers--------just a few small ones Saw this on Satilite channel , missed the first 30 min of movie , will keep this comment short and informative.The movie is basically about 5 characters , The acting is very bad for afew characters . 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it backfires and the 3 kidnap the 2 . This is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical , mysterious and ... you get the point ; but do to their own , personal , lack in thinking they fall terribly short . Like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd - looks the part but his tongue can 't speak it . THe writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurishly - unknowingly i believe - that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it . I wish i could give an example but i cant recall any - exactly as it was said . The ending was bad as well . But the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady , although she , as well as the rest , had a lot of clich챕 s.So Why would i give this movie a 7 stars if I thought all the above ? Simple , I give the entire seven stars to LISA KELLER - one sexy a $ $ momma . SHE is FINE lol . I am an appreciator of beauty , and she is exactly that . But don 't get me confused because I 'm not a pervert and this movie is NOT a porno in any way. their is somethin about her I cant explain , but i like it . I remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out , bumps into Keller . She tries to get way but she doesn 't have a chance . He throws her down , kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down , no panties ; ) . Now , although she has an AMAZING ass - and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think - it was her facial expression that got me. she wanted it , and that look had me thinking i was behind that . I would have torn that booty up ! After that expression , i jus couldn 't look at her objectively anymore , I WAS IN LOVE. lol . I am glad to have seen this movie but if Lisa Keller wasn 't playing the lead role , I would have changed the channel .. well ... after i had seen the scene i mentioned above . I am a LISA KELLER fan know , but is seems that she isn 't a consistent actor , seeing this 2003 movie is her latest . But i am lookin forward to another movie with her in it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The hilarious team that brought you ' CNNNN ' and ' The Chaser Decides ' have returned to the ABC with their new series , ' The Chaser 's War On Everything . ' Filmed in front of a live audience , the Chaser team , once again , does what it does best- lampooning key political figures , international celebrities and media personalities.The satire is simply priceless , and nothing is sacred . In recent weeks , the Chaser Team has chased alongside the Queen ( during her visit to Australia ) to try and have John Howard Dismissed and had Kim Beazley ( Aust . Opposition Leader ) threaten to kneecap them.A particularly funny segment is " " Mr. Ten Questions , " " showing an overly enthusiastic reporter who approaches celebrities ( recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys ) and asks them ten such inane questions as " " what is your optimum length of rice grain ? " " Just for the record , Theron ignored him and walked away , and one of the Backstreet Boys got angry and " " refused to dignify it with a response . " " A segment that recently had me in stitches was when one of the team decided to become a ' statue busker ' to score some extra money . When he realized how hopeless he was , he put a real statue in his place . THE PERFECT SCAM ! He got thirty dollars in twenty minutes ! A brilliant satire of everything in Australian society . Two thumbs up ! ( By the way , the show won 't be showing for the three weeks after Easter , because " " though the team are all atheists , they 're also hypocrites .

" Heh , if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5.9 , will you call me crazy ? That 's just to catch your attention . Everyday I meet people complaining there are no good movies , who seem to only know the recent blockbusters . It 's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies , especially those with good artistic values . Dick Tracy is one of those can 't be easily outdated , in terms of technology.The negative reviews mainly complained about DT 's " " messed up " " story . But it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear , and I had no problem following it . I didn 't see the comic books , yet I am not a huge US comic fan , but I appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances . Maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell . But , if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together , what would you expect . I had some scratches on my head , and can 't help but wonder , did we really see the same movie ? The title role , although not as competent as it sounds , still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences . Madonna was more express-less than " " breathless " " in her seductive role , but added a lot of fun to the story . Al Pacino was funny and prodigy to himself . Apparently he 's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles . We can see a hybrid of Scarface , Michael Corleone , Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh . And many thanks to make-ups.To me it 's not bad at all . The surreal feeling really got me . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I haven 't yet read the Kurt Vonnegut book this was adapted from , but I am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen . Overall , I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut 's novels . It concerns the story of an American living in Germany who is recruited as a spy for the US . His job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked Nazi 's and send secret messages to the American 's via his weekly radio show . But when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to New York , where various odd plot twists await.If Mother Night has a problem it 's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times . But for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb . And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing Christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked Nazi in a prison cell . Very much recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A beautiful film.John Garfield 's character is a distant relative of " " Les Miserables " " ' s Jean Valjean while detective Rains recalls Victor Hugo 's Javert , the ruthless arm of law.Like in many films noirs , the city epitomizes evil whereas the country and the nature represents sanctuary , redemption , and a second chance for those whose life seems forever doomed.But even in the luminous daylight , danger may appear suddenly , as the excellent scene at the reservoir shows.John Garfield -an actor who , as Leonard Maltin points out , should be rediscovered : I 've never been disappointed by any of his films except for his supporting part in " " gentleman 's agreement " " but it was not his fault-gives a heartfelt sensitive performance and the audience sides with him as soon as he is unjustly accused ( the first sequence shows a rather unkind hypocrite person , but all his trials redeem him and how do we feel for him during the last scenes with detective Rains.Colorful characters ( grandma and the kids ) add a lot of joie de vivre which is necessary .Humor is also present in the strip poker game as the Dead End brats fleece a rich kid.I recommend this movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Pre " Thunderball " or even before Cousteau became common , there was Mike Nelson sparking the imagination of kids .I 'd be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show .Underwater photography also progressed , the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show .

Best of all are the songs , beautiful music and moving lyrics . There are some great songs in this move ya 'll ! especially ' Kannathil Mutthamittal ' and ' Velai Pookal ' .

" An American in Paris was , in many ways , the ultimate mixture of art and Hollywood musical . Made at the height of MGM 's powers as a musical powerhouse , the film features memorable music from the Gershwins , who rightly have been called the 20th Century 's equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart . Gene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film , though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm-up for his best work in Singin ' in the Rain ( 1952 ) . The two films are actually closely linked . Aside from the Arthur Freed connection , the Broadway Melody segment in " " Rain " " owes its existence to the incredible American in Paris Ballet sequence in this film . This might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film . And it deserved to be , as it showcases Gene Kelly 's skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree.The film 's cast is uniformly excellent . Leslie Caron , incredibly making her film debut , shows a maturity that makes you think she 'd been making films for years . Her introductory dance sequence , and later her work on the Ballet , provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in MGM Musicals only by Cyd Charisse 's work in Singin ' in the Rain and The Band Wagon . Oscar Levant is hilarious as Kelly 's stoic pal , who gets two of the film 's best moments : during the end party sequence ( which I will not give away for anyone who hasn 't seen the film ) , and one of the film 's most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state-of-the-art ( for the time ) special effects.Less memorable are Georges Guetary as Kelly 's romantic rival , though he does get a few musical highlights , and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron 's romantic rival . The May-December relationship between Kelly 's character and Nina 's reminded me of the same " " kept man " " relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany 's.There are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than Singin ' in the Rain . The Ballet , though lavish and well-produced , doesn 't really fit with the rest of the movie . Without giving away the plot , the Ballet just happens , with no real rhyme or reason . And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence , it really doesn 't have anything to do with the plot -- and in the best musicals , the songs always have some sort of raison d 'etre . Making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the Ballet . Although the ending shouldn 't be a surprise ( this IS an MGM musical , after all ) , I was hoping for a bit more ... movie after the Ballet ended . It 's as if director Vincente Minnelli felt that he couldn 't follow the Ballet with anything else . The film literally left me in the lurch.That negative aside , An American in Paris rightly ranks alongside the best of Hollywood 's musicals . It doesn 't quite reach the heights of Singin ' in the Rain , but it comes close and it remains a testament to Gene Kelly 's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This wasn 't all that great . Not terrible or hateful or anything , just forgettable.It had a sort of , um , hesitant , diluted air , like it never properly knew whether it wanted to go for laughs or for sweetness or for satire . So we were left with weak mix of the three . The actors seemed kinda lost.Also , the ideas were really tired and recycled , almost zombified themselves . How many more times do we have to be told the 50 's in the States were infected with a banal sense of conformity ? And that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism ? And that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing ? Old hat.Its biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was . I know it was a comedy and all , but - especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period - you still need some sort of emotional anchor , some relatable guide through the story , to make it engaging . For the ' hero ' kid to watch an old woman , two fellow school pupils and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet it all with a cheery smile and a shrug of the shoulders , then I just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way . The mum was the same . If you make your two main characters so inhuman on that level , then you risk losing me and that 's what happened.Biggest positive I can offer is that I love the look of that sort of apple pie suburbia and this captured it well enough , it was a handsome film , especially some of those wide angled shots of the street and inside the Robinsons ' house . Also , the opening newsreel was cute , in a been-done-before-but-still-funny sort of way.And I thought Billy Connolly was OK and that comes from someone who isn 't a big fan of Billy Connolly : Movie Star . I just had this fear he was going to be hamming it up and trying to steal every scene , but he played it pretty low-key for him and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole film.All in all , not great though . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is a Frank Loesser masterpiece of amusing lyrics , competent themes and solid construction by those who adapted Damon Runyon material to the musical 's " " book " . " What is surprising about the film is how seamlessly the musical numbers flow from the storyline . Abe Burrows did the book with contributions from Loesser ; Michael Kidd was the choreographer , and the outstanding art direction was contributed by Joseph Wright . The storyline can be told in two sentences . Nathan Detroit , played by Frank Sinatra , needs cash to finance his permanent floating crap game to amuse Big Julie , a Chicago Mob Boss . He bets odds-player Sky Masterson , well-presented by Marlon Brando , that he cannot get a Salvation Army girl to go to Havana with him ; Masterson wins the bet , saves the Mission , falls in love with the girl , gets the gamblers and riffraff at the crap game to attend a service , and tells everybody the lady was impervious to his charms--a complete lie . Of course he ends up with the lady ; and Detroit marries hi long-suffering fianc챕e , Vivian Blaine . Others in the cast include Stubby Kaye , Johnny Silver , Robert Keith , B.S. Pulley as Big Julie the Mobster , Sheldon Leonard , Regis Toomey , Mary Alan Kokanson , Kathryn Givney as the Salvation Army leader , Veda Ann Borg and Jean Simmons as the tepid Salvation Army girl , Sarah Brown . The famous musical numbers in this award-winning Broadway smash include " " Fugue For Tinhorns " , " " " Guys and Dolls " , " " " Luck Be a Lady " , " " " I 'll Know " , " " " A Person Could Develop a Cold " , " and " " The Oldest Established Permnanet Floating Crap Game in New York ! " . " Joseph L. Mankiewicz of " " Cleopatra " " and " " Letter to Three Wives " " Fame directed the proceedings ; and the flow of the work is very interestingly and successfully kept moving . He is equally adept at getting fine dialogue acting and directing such huge numbers as " " Luck Be Lady " , " the varied and challenging brawl section , the Havana " " A Woman in Love " " section created for the film that precedes it , the presenting of the title song " " Guys and Dolls " " and " " Pet Me , Poppa " " set in the club where Blaine works . The acting is very uneven . Simmons seems wrong for the part at times , Brando gets by with the singing and is very good much of the time on instinct , charm and underplaying , even in the comedy. scenes . Sinatra tries hard but is wrong for the role for several reasons as Nathan Detroit ; Blaine is a bit too-theatrical in selling her numbers , which she of course sings professionally . Leonard , Toomey , Kaye , Keith and Pulley do what is asked and more at all points . The stylized opening and closing are made to work well ; all in all , this film is a triumph for Loesser 's amiable and subtle lyrics , for director Mankiewicz as ringmaster , and for the genre of musicals itself , so ably justified in this instance . Delightful and very different . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Tony Hawk Underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster , Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting.Underground introduced the storymode , which was very cool because it made a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans . Another feature introduced which fans pretty much argued for and that was being able to get off the skateboard , which is nice because now you can actually climb , run , and do all sorts of new things.The levels are good , Neversoft also improved on an issue that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs . The first two games for the PS1 , N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some . Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits . In this version , they shortened those features , there isn 't as many people wondering the streets , in fact there are almost none in some levels , and the graphics and the skating physics are toned down a little but not a lot.This game does have one con , the storymode is a little short , of course this is Neversofts first time doing this with Tony Hawk Pro Skater , so that is understandable . However , with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day.Overall , a great addition that was very refreshing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Just saw a pre-screening tonight . What can I say ? It lived up to it 's mediocre trailer run , though that 's saying nothing at all . It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn 't done , and it played out in such a clich챕 fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience , and instead let the humorless movie play out.So let 's see ... we have the less-than-spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex-girlfriend but he 's not good enough for her , check . We have the three buddies that all have their own " " personality " " with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character 's best friend but is constantly rejected , another friend being the super awkward one that can 't live down seeing the positive in everything 24 / 7 and is thrown in for the one-liners ( which in this case is just a bunch of movie references , specifically from Disney ) , and the third guy whose name you won 't ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen ... check . We have the girl 's ex-boyfriend and her parents * * * * -block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up , not to mention the awkward family members from the main character 's side ... check . We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed , check . We have the movie 's " " funny " " moments come from incessant swearing , people falling down or being hit , scenes from the trailer , and homosexual innuendos ... check . And dare I call it a spoiler , but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie ... check.Honestly , this could have ... no , wait ... should have been a PG-13 movie . All that needed to be dropped were any F-bombs . Honestly , it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor , would have gotten less media exposure , and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R-rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up . The humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn 't fit in with what general people look for . I bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera . Let 's put it this way ... in the theater , it will help you laugh because it 's on the big screen and others are laughing . When this movie hits Showtime and you 're checking it out at 2 : 00 PM on an off-day , you may be inclined to change the channel . The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve 's hotness ( who is not quite a 10 , but still very good looking ) .Aside from the main resolution , this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie , where everything else pretty much flies out the window . So there is a main resolution , but what comes of it ? It 's never really clear-cut , nor does it allow the ending to be " " feel-good " " with the abruptness.There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie , and that was the good soundtrack . Aside from the nice choice of 90 's alternative rock songs , there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie ( more so the beginning of it ) that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up / compose . I 'll give them props for a great choice of sound.One last thing , this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer , because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion . I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it . But I say hold onto your money . If this was PG-13 and you were 15 years old on a Friday night with a group of friends , I 'd say knock yourselves out . Otherwise , definitely pass . It doesn 't try and compete with the R-rated movies of the past few years , and ideally it definitely isn 't as good . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Not having heard of this film , it came as a surprise when it was shown on cable recently . Gary Ellis , the gifted director of " " Tough Luck " , " does wonders with the screen play written by Bill Boatman and Todd King . The film involves the viewer from the start.Archie , the young hustler at the center of this story , has been involved in all kinds of petty crime . In fact , we witness a confrontation right at the beginning which makes him get out of New Orleans , as fast as he can . He ends up in the carnival that is run by the mysterious Ike . Archie falls for Davina , the woman he should have been wise to stay away from . The result proves a fatal judgment for Archie who then becomes the object of double crossing all around.The director should be commended by the casting of Norman Reedus , who obviously is loved by the camera . In spite of his nature , one feels for him because we know his heart is in the right place . The beautiful Dagmara Dominczyk is perfect as the exotic dancer Divana who , in spite of being Ike 's lover , entices Archie into falling heads over heels with her . Armand Assante is barely understandable with the thick accent he speaks during the first half of the film . " " Tough Luck " " shows a new director , Gary Ellis , showing he will go to do bigger and better things because he knows what he is doing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A wonderful , free flowing , often lyrical film that whisks you along , ever smiling , even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way . One gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well . This is possibly Depardieu 's best performance , certainly his most natural . Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age . Miou-Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play . Initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant / romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges . In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

William Powell is as affable a Philo Vance as you will find . He never seems to press and is always very smooth in what he says and does . Powell is aided by a host of very talented actors - some first-rate character actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece that hated her uncle , Ralph Morgan as the dead man 's secretary , Paul Cavanaugh as a rival dog fancier , Arthur Hohl as a mysterious butler , Helen Vinson as the next door kept blonde , and two really good performances by James Lee as the Chinese cook and portly Eugene Palette as a wise-cracking police detective . Add into the mix a wonderfully comedic turn by Etienne Girardot as a public coroner always missing his meal . It is this depth of suspects and a story that has many plots twists and turns that make The Kennel Murder Case a fast-moving , fun mystery . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" French film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary , everyday suburban life . This was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of L 'Emploi du temps ( Time Out ) , a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker 's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . As is the penchant of French filmmakers , many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places , giving a cinema verite feel to the story , yet L 'Emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage ( most notably a Swiss mountain retreat ) . Running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive French production , Jacques Audiard 's gritty crime caper , Sur mes levres ( Read My Lips ) . Actually , to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . As with the earlier French release , it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . In a Paris construction firm Carla , a shy , diminutive young woman sits at her desk , sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms.Obnoxious coworkers use the front of Carla 's desk to chat and drop off their half-finished Styrofoam cups of coffee . Partially deaf , Carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome , be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend 's baby . When her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load , Carla fears she may lose her job . At the employment office Carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant ( preferably male ) as if she were at a Personals Agency . He should be 25 years old and clean -cut , with extensive computer and filing skills . When the agency sends over an unkempt , menacing looking young man , Carla is both shocked and intrigued . They leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery , where Carla interviews her prospective assistant . When she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison , Carla initially wants nothing to do with Paul , but has a change of heart and hires him on . Although she is basically kind toward her helper , Carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . Paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . Carla helps Paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why Paul missed his appointment . During one of their lunch breaks Carla informs Paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . Later , when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project Carla has been working on , a furious Carla asks Paul 's help in seeking revenge on the man . From here on in Sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . The screenplay borrows elements from Hitchcock , most notably REAR WINDOW , where Carla 's lip-reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . There is a teasing , on-again , off-again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to NORTH BY NORTHWEST , but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . That being said , what one carries away from this movie isn 't so much the similarities to classic Hitchcock thrillers , although those elements are definitely there , but the pervasive view a of a modern day city ( in this case Paris ) where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy , garish nightlife where sex , drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . Unlike Hollywood productions , this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street , where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . It 's Hitchcock with the gloves off . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night . It 's an amazing movie . A very disturbing one at that.In a way , Zero Day is very comparable to " " The Blair Witch Project " . " It 's shot completley with handheld camcorders . It 's about 2 kids . Just your average kids . Andre and Calvin . They start a campaign against there High School entitled " " Army of 2 " . " The whole story is told in Video Diary form , from the 2 kids . It shows there relationships with there parents , amongst other people , showing that these are just normal kids , just like people we know or who have bumped into . We find out The Army of 2 's last mission will be entitles Zero Day . They plan to shoot up there High School.You see how they get access to there guns , how they plan it out , everything . They stress that the media has not affected them at all , and there is no reason for doing this . Like I said , this is all told in Video Diary form , and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after Zero Day.The actual shooting is shown through Survillence Cameras throughout the school . Chilling indeed . The movie is very chilling . Some of the things they say , how they plan it out , you 'd just have to see it for yourself . One quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is byhimself . He says " " Andre thinks were just gonna leave in some getaway car , doing this to numerous schools across the country . I don 't know what he 's thinking , but the only way I 'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag " . " I 'm probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film .

" Warning : Herzog is a filmaker , and as such tends to be a bit overly dramatic . So obsessions about closing doors may or may not be a real part of the character 's life , but a filmaker 's dramatic embellishment - or so both agreed at the premiere in San Francisco . But Herzog 's usual fascination with character , dreams and perseverance are well suited by this story first published in Soldier of Fortune , and now a full length autobiographical book . ( The Soldier of Fortune comment brought loud boos from the politically correct SF audience , and both filmaker and main character had to ensure the audience who had just seen the film , that SOF 's interest was misplaced - so warning , this is not Rambo , just survival . ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar , with his eyes on a big inheritance , decides to dope them and get them out of the picture . How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris ? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O 'Malley , a rough diamond with romance in his heart . After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world , he guides them home , and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse . As always , it 's really the voices rather than the animation that are the heart of the Disney magic : Phil Harris is brilliant as O 'Malley , Eva Gabor as Duchess is ... well ... Eva Gabor ; but perhaps the most memorable turns are by Pat Buttram and George Lindsay , who turn the old hounds Napoleon and Lafayette into a couple of bumbling Southern-fried rednecks . Their scenes with Edgar , and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool-dude band , are classic . Most striking about seeing The Aristocats now is how deeply Disney 's style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970 . Perhaps the nostalgic , dated feel are just a result of being plonked down in Belle Epoque Paris , but the illustrations are fussier ( a pity ) and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic ( sometimes a relief ) than in more recent efforts such as Aladdin . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" God ! Zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as Tarzan , and probably had about as many actors in the title role . This Serial is one of my own personal favourites , and as previously stated , it is one of the Top 5 Sound Serials . Oddly enough , this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939 . * By the time of this production in ' 39 , Zorro was really well known as a ( Pulp ) literary and movie character . The film opens up with a little foot note about the History of the Mexico 's struggle for freedom from rule by a European Monarchy , namely Spain . The story invites comparison with the American Revolutionary War.The story concentrates its attention to the mythical Province of San Mendelito and its ' Council ' . It is being addressed by Benito Juarez * * on their gold mine 's relation to the new Republic of Mexico . Gold shipments must get thru to Mexico City.Don Francisco Uncle to Diego Vega , states that he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoys.A thug from the Don del Oro mob , stages an ' insult ' to himself and challenges Don Francisco to a duel with swords , Don Frasncisco getting run through.Suddenly the dark clad masked swordsman appears to sword fight and after carving the trademark ' Z ' on the face of the bad guy , he dispatches him to the hereafter . Don Francisco declares with his dying breath to his ward Ramon ( William Corson ) that Zorro is his nephew from the city of Los Angeles . He also attempts to tell of the true identity of Don del Oro , but expires before completing statement.There is a big reception for Diego at Don Francisco 's Hacienda , where Diego disappoints Ramon 'sister ( also ward of Don Francisco ) with his timid act . " " A FOP ! ! " , " she declares.Later , Diego and Ramon slip away to join up with a meeting of the volunteers . When they ask , " " who will lead us with Don Francisco now dead ? " , " Ramon declares " " Zorro , we are Zorro 's Fighting Legion ! " " Well there is a big battle with the Legion , now all clad on gray , with masks and capes , protecting the Gold Train . Then Zorro seems trapped at a man-made avalanche intended for the convoy , when , well , you know cliffhanger end of Chapter One.Wow ! That was a lot of writing for one Chapter , but like most other Serials , the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to be laid to set up the story line . Let 's just let it suffice to say that there are 11 more good , well made , action filled Chapters following.ZORRO 's FIGHTING LEGION has all of the elements that made for top cliffhanger action . We have an unknown evil leader who is fomenting trouble between different groups . There is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of ' Don del Oro ' . We had soldiers , renegade Whites , hostile Indians and the Legion.In short , it 's safe to say that there is everything one could want , and then some , in this Serial . And , incidentally , they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any Mexican accents.As to just what is there here that makes ZFL stand out from the rest ? What makes it different or unique ? Well ........ First of all , it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and underlining the drama and action on the screen . The opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the Cantina in Chapter One . This is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in serial sound track.And yet there is one more feature that really sets the Fighting Legion saga out in front from all others . That is , the film not only has a heroic musical theme , but it also sports Lyrics , yes , the Legionairres sing ! We hear them singing in the opening credits and in several Chapters ! It really works well and adds to the feelings we get from the viewing.When the Serial was first shown on our local television ( circa 1955 ) , all of the gang immediately recognized the voice of Reed Hadley as belonging to ' Captain Braddock from RACKET SQUAD , the TV Series . Mr. Hadley had a very distinctive , deep voice . * * * He also handled the role very well . His costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functional.There is a small slip up . A sort of minor anachronism occurs by having Benito Juarez ( Carleton Young ) addressing the San Mendelito Council , as Juarez was about 18 years old at this time ( 1824 ) and , though he was later perhaps the greatest single figure in Mexico 's History , he surely hadn 't achieved such prominence yet . His inclusion in story probably was to cash in on the release of Warner Brothers ' JUAREZ that year , which starred Paul Muni in the title role.This is not only my pick as a top 5 sound serial , but also my favourite Zorro film . * We are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year , what with GONE WITH THE WIND , MR.SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON , THE CITADEL , JUAREZ , THE WIZARD OF OZ , OF MICE AND MEN , ONE MILLION B.C. , ZENOBIA , WE WANT OUR MUMMY all counted among the output that year . * * Once again , Juarez did not ascend to any national importance until around 1850 , about 25 years later . Also , the political sub-divisions are referred to as ' Provinces ' in the story . In actuality , they are called ' States ' . Just as we are called the United States of America , so too , South of the Border they call their Repubhlic the United States of Mexico . * * * Reed Hadley was prominent in some very ' A ' pictures in which his richly toned voice is exploited to good effect . Watch & listen for his narration in THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET ( 1945 ) and GUADALCANAL DIARY ( 1945 ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film stars Peter Lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who immigrates to America . Unfortunately , shortly after his arrival , he 's in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned . Because he looks so awful , no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation , he resorts to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness . Where exactly the film goes from there , you 'll just need to see for yourself.I scored this movie an 8 because , for the money spent to make it , it 's a heck of a good film with a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting . The film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film , but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises . In addition , the excellent acting by Lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles . This is an excellent film and delivers more than most " " A-pictures " " of the day . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Frankie Darro was a wonderful child actor who excelled at playing pugnacious little toughs with gigantic chips on their shoulders . He appeared in a couple of top films of the early 30s - " " The Public Enemy " " ( 1931 ) , a ground breaking crime drama and " " Wild Boys of the Road " " ( 1933 ) , a topical depression era movie about kids who ride the rails . He was essentially a younger version of James Cagney . Although short of height , his willingness to do his own stunts kept him employed in a series of programmers when the bigger studios had no more use for him . " " Crime School " " was supposed to be a remake of " " The Mayor of Hell " " but it had far more humour in it and featured The Dead End Kids and Humphrey Bogart as a very laid back Deputy Commisssioner . " " The Mayor of Hell " " is really a combination of " " Hell 's House " " / " " Crime School " " / " " Boy 's Town " . " Even though Cagney didn 't make his appearance until around the 25th minute his impact ( as usual ) was immediate . He plays a hot headed gangster who is on the payroll of a political group run by the mob.Jimmy Smith ( Frankie Darro ) and his gang ( including " " Farina " " from " " Our Gang " " ) run a car washing racket but bite off more than they can chew when they rob a general store and push the owner through a plate glass window . They appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to the state reformatory . It is painted in glowing terms - a model school where boys are given a chance to learn a trade . In reality , it is a hellish place run by a sadistic warden , Mr. Thompson ( outstandingly played by Dudley Digges ) . The only compassionate person is Dorothy Griffith , the live-in nurse ( played by Madge Evans ) . " " Patsy " " Gargan ( James Cagney ) has been given the job as the new Deputy Commissioner , as a favour . On his arrival at the school he witnesses a failed escape attempt and after talking to Dorothy , realises the school needs sweeping reforms . He is soon running the school and brings in a system of " " self government " " - rather along the lines of " " Boy 's Town " . " Even though Cagney doesn 't have a lot to do , the picture is carried along to it 's gripping climax by the energy of Darro . After " " Patsy " " is temporarily out of the picture ( he accidentally shoots a mobster and has to leave the state ) , Thompson returns and his brutal treatment , resulting in the death of a boy ( " " Skinny " " ) turn the rest of the boys into an angry mob . They burn down a barn and Thompson falls to his death - " " Patsy " " returning just in time to quieten the mob with some sobering talk.Sure , all the boys seemed to get was a stiff talking to for their crimes but I do disagree with one of the reviewers - Thompson was more than just a " " meanie " . " His sadistic treatment resulted in a boy 's death . There is a scene at the beginning where the boys are served some inedible slop - Thompson orders ham and eggs and keeps piling the butter on his bread while talking to Dorothy . Allan Jenkins plays " " Uncle " " Mike and Sheila Terry , although billed only as " " a blonde " " has one of the most memorable lines when she pouts and says " " I thought there was going to be young boys here , where are they ?

" Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the ' normal ' way , once with the scenes in consecutive order ( in this doozy of a film noir , the beginning , middle and end of the story intertwine ) , and once with the director 's commentary running . Quite amazing . A bare-bones tale , told with more flair , energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today . I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento , which turned me on to Nolan in the first place . Can 't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget ( and bigger box-office stars ) in his next film , Insomnia . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I just found DVD of Yank Tanks there , great doc , but how sad for it to end up as a rock-bottom remainder.I loved this film , wish I 'd seen it at the cinema in it 's everything . I 'd have preferred that New Yorker Films had translated the title directly . It 's good for Americans to stretch a little . If the film 's title helps the US audience to explore random chaos , all the better . Cinema imitates life & visa versa.Also , I found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars . Come on ! The euro is not hard to figure out , make the gringo audiences do the math . Seeing a film , especially one shot in Paris , the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded : I am an American watching a movie and they are translating the Euros into dollars for me .

" Or maybe not . Whatever anyone thinks of " " Broadcast News , " " good or bad , almost all the credit for that " " thinking " " belongs to writer-producer-director James L. Brooks . As a screenwriter ( of which he has long been one of the best ) , it is not easy to savage an entire business -- in this case , the " " business " " being television news -- but to do it with a smile , a wink , a knowing nod and a laugh practically every step of the way . To do all that takes real talent , something Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance.One user on this website , in his summary , asked the musical question -- " " Did Walter Cronkite act like this ? " " Answerve : No ! Of course not ! And the reason for that is in Walter 's -- uh , Mr. Cronkite 's -- day , the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to the people . Same goes for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith . Sure , they had to pay lip-service attention to their ratings , if only to please their bosses . But all they REALLY cared about was THE NEWS ITSELF.Now , of course , all that has changed . For the last 25-30 years in the network news business , the only thing that has really mattered is ratings , ratings , ratings . The bottom line . How many bucks will our news division deliver for the network ? Don 't believe that ? Let 's consider " " The Big Three " " : Tom Brokaw , Dan Rather and Peter Jennings ( aka " " Stanley Stunning " " ) . All three have now been on the job at their respective anchor desks for the last 15-20 years ( Peter actually got his first shot at the national anchor desk way back in the 1960s but was totally unprepared for the job ) . Of the three , Dan is the one with the greatest in-the-field training as a reporter . Personally , I think all three do terrific jobs as news anchors and are deserving of their positions . All of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually IN those jobs . All three are now in their 60 's ( Dan is pushing the big 7-0 ) and all three are still very good looking . And if you think they 're still good looking now , imagine how good looking they were in their 40 's , when all three were hired for ( let 's say , " " put in " " ) their current jobs . But do you honestly believe that any one of these three would have been " " put in " " had he looked like , let 's say , Fred Gwynne ( " " Herman Munster " " ) . Or like -- heaven forfend -- ME ! ! ! Not only that , if Dan were retiring tomorrow , a younger ( than he is today ) Walter Cronkite would not be able to get his old job back . Why ? Not pretty enough . And it would matter not a whit that he is , or once was , " " the most trusted man in America . " " And this is what " " Broadcast News " " is all about . Tom Grunnick ( William Hurt ) , the next pretty-boy-national-news-anchor-to-be who has trouble with a few minor things , such as thinking for himself , being able to write and knowing stuff . Jane Craig ( Holly Hunter ) , the brilliant news producer with news business standards and ethics , all of which get thrown to the wind when even she falls for pretty-boy-Tom . And Aaron Altman ( Albert Brooks , no relation to James L. ) , a top-notch newswriter and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he " " flop-sweats " " behind the anchor desk . And many other such flawed characters whom you KNOW really do exist in the news divisions of the various networks . " " Network " " blazed the trail . Eleven years later , " " Broadcast News " " carried the torch as a worthy successor . In the new millennium , what will be the next movie to savage the business of network " " news you can use " " ..... maybe . Or maybe not . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The author of " " Nekromantik " , " J철rg Buttgereit 's second feature film , " " Der Todesking " " is a powerful masterpiece . Centered around a chain letter originating from a group called " " The Brotherhood of the 7th Day " , " the movie shows 7 episodes , each consisting of one day during one week , where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making it 's rounds . Do not touch this one if you like Hollywood movies or musicals , enjoy happy or even remotely " " normal " " movies or expect a movie to be good only , if it is focused on stage acting.The nihilistic , avant-garde approach of Der Todesking well explains , why Buttgereit 's movies in general were banned in Germany , their native country of origin , during the 80 's and most of the 90 's . Der Todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on-screen , but the meaningless apathy or depression most people 's lives consist of in general . Buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living , only reasons to stop , and in choosing how and when you die , you can also be the king of death , Der Todesking.Buttgereit 's movies are generally difficult to categorize and Der Todesking is no exception . Featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies , " " art film " " would probably be the closest description every time . Der Todesking features an original method to shoot , create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene . During one scene , the camera slowly , continuously pans in 360 degree circle , while a person lives in a small one-room apartment for a day . During another , Buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man , while he dwells in his desperation . During a third , seemingly pleasant scene names , ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on-screen , supposedly warranting the ban in Germany for this particular movie.Episode movies ( and especially this one , as the scenes are only vaguely connected ) generally suffer from incoherence , and Der Todesking is no exception . While all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and it 's consequences or subsequences in all it 's variations , there are very powerful episodes , yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material , partly draining the overall power of the movie - still , the the jaw-dropping , immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from it 's more vague moments back to the status of greatness . The general atmosphere is baffling , awe-inspiring , highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting - so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival I took part of.This is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and I strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come . Not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans , this is a small , different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience . Whether it be confusion , amazement or even hate , you aren 't likely to be left cold by this , in my opinion the best , achievement of this small indie crew.The main theme of the movie , " " Die Fahrt ins Reich der Menschentr체mmer part I-III " " was released in a limited 666-piece 8 " " vinyl edition , which is now much sought after . You still can get the classical masterpiece by getting " " The Nekromantik " " soundtrack CD , which I highly recommend . The Lo-Fi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky , almost illbient-like , makes an essential part of the movie 's atmosphere , and is something you would very , very rarely hear otherwise . Much recommended ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " The Matador " " is a dark comedy starring Pierce Brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight-arrow , happily-married American businessman ( Greg Kinnear ) in Mexico . Although the sardonic Julian ( ironically surnamed " " Noble " " ) appears to be a " " tough guy " " on the surface , underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities , a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless . Thus on his birthday , he reaches out to Danny , a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by Julian 's " " unconventional " " lifestyle . In fact , both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter , franker moments of self-evaluation.Although the film is a bit too reminiscent of " " Analyze This " " and " " Midnight Run " " to feel entirely fresh and original , " " The Matador , " " nevertheless , earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting . Brosnan , looking aged and almost used up , sinks his teeth into the role of Julian in a way he never has before . Playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being , Brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment , then genuine and sympathetic the next . He always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale . Kinnear is also excellent as the Regular Joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the Dark Side as his relationship with Julian deepens . Hope Davis does a fine job as " " Bean , " " Danny 's loyal and loving wife who , like her husband , finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and " " dangerous " " figure from a world far different from the one she knows.At times , we find ourselves feeling that " " The Matador " " is holding something back from us , not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise . At the end it feels a little too light , a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should . This could be because this is the feature film debut for writer / director Richard Shephard , and he hasn 't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet . Still , one appreciates the fact that he doesn 't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece , rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh . ' The Matador " " is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will , hopefully , signal a new phase in Brosnan 's acting career . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

She is going to cheat on you when player like those on that show approach her somewhere.Off course any male who is not as good as these guys are going to hate them and hate the show . And that one chick who thinks this show is meant to mock these guys .. its more actually how to show clueless man how to pick up woman.What these guys are doing it way better then what most man are doing-not approaching at all.For anybody who has open mind I recommend to read the book " " the game " " by neil strauss.It deals with similar theme as this show , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon , who I 've had a crush on since 9th grade , which was his first year on SNL . I am a die-hard Yankees fan , and I didn 't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes , when they begin showing clips of the ALCS games . I had to cover my ears and make small noises so I wouldn 't have to hear that which must not be heard , but otherwise it was completely bearable.I thought Jimmy played the role very well , because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky , and he is a nervous and quirky guy . I know that it may not be a Academy Award-winning stretch , but the movie is just a light , fun , romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see.Jimmy and Drew worked well together , and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past . ( Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie ? What ? ) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him , and thank goodness , because Taxi could have killed it . I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot . Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies . I imagine it must be difficult , and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time ( Tom Hanks , Russell Crowe , etc ) you 'll see that they started off in some flops . Busom Buddies ? Australian soap operas ? Here 's wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen . I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sam Kleinman ( Peter Falk ) comes to his son 's place unexpectedly.His son Ben Kleinman ( Paul Reiser ) is quite surprised to hear that his mother , Muriel Kleinman ( Olympia Dukakis ) has left his father.Ben 's wife , Rachel ( Elizabeth Perkins ) and his three sisters try to find Muriel while Ben and his father go see a farmhouse that 's for sale.But that 's not the end of their journey.Their road trip turns into a long therapy session between Ben and his father.Raymond De Felitta is the director of The Thing About My Folks ( 2005 ) .Paul Reiser is behind the screenplay and he has done a remarkable job.The dialogue between Ben and Sam is just amazing.And he did work with the script for twenty years so no wonder it 's this good.Who would be better man to play the father than Peter Falk ? Nobody , I can tell you that.And I really love the story on why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the part.Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh.And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie.It 's just hilarious when they go fishing.And how the old guy beats the younger one in the game of pool and then beats him with the stick.The movie is often very funny and I found myself laughing several times.But it can also be touching from time to time.You couldn 't tell a story any better than it is told here . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film . Let 's only hope they 'll have the chance . I would rate this film as one of the best movies I 've seen in a year . It contains no violence , action scenes , murders , sex , so evidently distributors question whether or not to pick it up .

" The French Naudet brothers did something nobody else did , they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened . They were in Building # 2 , when you could see papers drifting down , people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height.I mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running , their camera was still running , when the white dust covered them , they found a shop doorway and got inside , but all this footage is real and I think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us.Ten stars goes to the Naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that I watch every 9 / 11 so I 'll never forget what this country went through .

" For those unfamiliar with Paddy Chayefsky , this is a very good introduction . While Chayefsky deals with the reality behind the myths of many things including medicine , this work is surprisingly prophetic of the way medicine is going today , two decades after the movie was made and over a decade after his death . Beyond that , some insights into Chayefsky 's view of life in general are ' slipped into ' the movie as well . The 20th Century may well turn out to be the first and last century of the United States in the History of the World .

" A very credible and unsettling movie portraying the effects of war on the general public , Shame gives us a chilling understanding oh Ingmar Bergman 's beliefs . The absence of color and sound ( as in a soundtrack ) helps to give the film a more realistic feeling . There is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect . Everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality . At times the storyline was confusing , but perhaps in order to give a sense of the characters ' frame of mind 혯 how they too do now know what is happening or why . The simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring , but I could understand how the director is trying not to glamorize the story and points . He depicted the harsh and unsettling events and effects of war . In the beginning the characters were introduced and shown as content with the lighter settings and very long , drawn-out shots . When all of a sudden the war struck upon them , they were much darker and quiet with less intimate shots . Bergman did a good job on allowing us to be consumed by the war ourselves and presenting an image of it the so adequately corresponded to war . Although the storyline itself was not too impressive , the content of the film was . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station.They were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy . It ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary.The rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be . The make-up was good and I have seen way worse movies then this one .

" I saw this movie about a year ago , and found it to be completely Laugh-Out-Loud funny . A real winner , in my mind . It had the underlining of a stupid comedy , but indeed had an actual plot as well . Much like the hit comedy , Elf , in fact . It had a few serious moments , sandwiched between hilarity . When Stiller shot Black 's horse , an ordinarily sober moment , you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antics . You can actually find common ground there , as I 'm sure many people have done something they wouldn 't want a friend to find out about , lest your friendship should end.When I found out how much people disliked this movie , I was completely dumbfounded . That absolutely terrible movies like Napoleon Dynamite had ratings higher than it makes me wonder about the sanity of people on IMDb . Take my advice and rent it .

" Henry Fool is a better film . But this is the perfect way to follow-up a film like ' Henry Fool . ' To take Henry very seriously , his ' lies ' and his mysterious aura . Even the opening shot of ' Henry Fool ' when Simon puts his ear to the ground as Henry comes walking over the hill is more fully manifest through ' Fay Grim . ' The over-the-top jokes , that are more or less meta-jokes ( about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves ) , are good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them . Also Hartley 's use of Dutch angles throughout the film is jarring , yes , it 's intention , but it feels forced and over-used , it goes beyond jarring to , what I 'd like to call , annoying . It 's a flawed film , but a must see for any Hartley or ' Henry Fool ' fan . And don 't listen to stupid reviews , don 't watch this unless you 've seen the first film .

" Given the title , this first follow-up to QUARTET ( 1948 ) obviously reduces the number of W. Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film . The author still turns up to introduce the episodes , but there ? 셲 no epilogue this time around ; by the way , while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C. Sheriff , here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation , as well as Noel Langley ( though it ? 셲 unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison ) . As can be expected , much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment ? ? though this also extends to at least three cast members , namely Naunton Wayne , Wilfrid Hyde-White and Felix Aylmer ( the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled ? 쏷he Colonel ? 셲 Lady ? ? . While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor ( slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time ) , it ? 셲 still done with the utmost care , acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain . ? 쏷he Verger ? ? tells of a church sexton ( James Hayter ) ? ? for which the story ? 셲 title is another word ? ? who ? 셲 dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest ( Michael Hordern ) simply because he ? 셲 illiterate . Rather than rest on his laurels , despite his age , he not only takes a wife ( his landlady , played by Kathleen Harrison ) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered ? ? and , with business flourishing , this is developed into a whole chain . The last scene , then , sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who , not only is surprised to learn of Hayter ? 셲 lack of education , but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were ? ? to which the wealthy ( and respected ) tobacconist replies , with some measure of irony , that he had the calling to be a verger ! The second episode , ? 쏮r . Know-All ? ? is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging : a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man ( Nigel Patrick ) , British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada , who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun . Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most ? ? the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrick ? 셲 attentions to his pretty wife ( Anne Crawford ) . During a fancy-dress party , however , the passengers decide to enact their ? 쁱evenge ? ? on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him ( a jest which he naturally doesn ? 셳 appreciate ) ! ; still , it ? 셲 here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character ? ? told by Crawford that the necklace she ? 셲 wearing is an imitation , Wayne challenges Patrick to name its price ? 쫇ut the latter realizes immediately that it ? 셲 the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawford ? 셲 position if he were to tell , so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer ! As can also be deduced from the title , ? 쏶anatorium ? ? deals with the myriad patients at such a place ? ? run by Andre ' Morell ; the protagonist is a new intern , Roland Culver , who wistfully observes the various goings-on . The narrative , in fact , highlights in particular three separate strands of plot ? ? one humorous ( the ? 쁣eud ? ? between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium , played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie ) , one melodramatic ( the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies ) and one bittersweet ( the romance between na챦ve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which , in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a ? 쁫ifer ? ? while Rennie only has a few years left to him , leads the couple to the altar ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I studied Charlotte Bronte 's novel in high school , and it left me with a stunning impression . Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman 's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England . This young woman was Jane Eyre , a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own . Her story , which Bronte told through Jane 's own eyes , was both sad and inspiring . As part of our study , we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story , and it blew me away . The mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte 's original text and the essence of the story , but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great . Both Zelah Clarke ( Jane Eyre ) and Timothy Dalton ( Jane 's lover , by the name of Rochester ) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters . I cannot imagine anyone else in their roles . ( The other performances of Rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion , energy , and tenderness needed to portray Rochester accurately . I say that Timothy Dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of Rochester . Zelah Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre , but she captures Jane 's quiet , but firm and passionate nature brilliantly . She holds in her emotions , like the Jane of the book , at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in Jane 's passionate scenes . The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to Jane and Rochester 's devoted relationship . ) As well , the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly , and the sets fit the Gothic nature of the story . I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale . If you have not read the book before , then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s , it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series , as much as " " Raiders of the Lost Ark " , " only done on a low budget and much campier by director Michael Anderson .

" So many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so I duly responded . Here are some remarks .. Vanessa Redgrave is great even while lying in bed . She also looks very old and I don 't think this is achieved with much make-up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema-goers . I think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years . Claire Danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth . Mamie Gummer 's resemblance to her mother Merly Streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that I lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance . She is surprisingly good ; however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor . I agree with a previous comment : Natasha Richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face . She certainly does not look like how I remember her from previous films ( " " Nell " " for example . ) Both she and Toni Collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters . Their interplay is weak . Toni Collette additionally is way too old for her character . Glenn Close and Meryl Streep had to have more screen time . Streep 's performance actually is little more than a cameo . Her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film . Eileen Atkins provides some welcome dry wit , especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to Redgrave 's character . As for the men ; Hugh Dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed . As a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag . It is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer . Patrick Wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film . He also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people ( one of them a man ) are so much smitten by this man . The backstory to this should have been developed more.The cinematography is excellent as expected . However the main summer house set failed to convince me . It does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill , particularly with its grass patch in the front . A bit too cardboard like.Overall , the film is a classy production , but a seen-it-all-before , cried-at-it-all-before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that I expected from a tearjerker . However , it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time , about one 's expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not . Worth trying at least on DVD if not at the movies ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is an excellent but hard to find trippy World War I spy thriller in the inimitable 60 's Italian style . From the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene with Capucine and the elaborately produced apocalyptic no man 's land battle scenes with poison gas and German cavalry in full gas proof ' storm trooper ' gear , this is a movie that should not be missed . It is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield . Apart from the battle scenes , some of the production and special effects are primitive , apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes , but for lovers of 60 's cinema it should not be an issue .

Shame , is a well acted and well made story of how people in a desperate situation will sometimes do whatever they can do in order to survive . The film has a powerful message and is a good film . The reason I 'am not rating this film higher is because it is not a masterpiece like some other Ingmar Bergman films like Wild Strawberries , The Seventh Seal or Persona , for example . The film didn 't have as big an impact on me as I thought it would and it lacked Ingmar Bergman 's thoughtful and philosophical dialog .

" I normally don 't comment on movies on IMDB , but in this case I feel like I should . I love movies , and I want to make them , and this movie is a perfect example of fine filmmaking.This is one of the few movies that I have seen on the small screen ( originally seeing it air on AMC , I believe , and then on the DVD I just watched ) that made me get that feeling in the pit of my stomach . That little gnawing sensation that the director would hope you feel while watching his thriller.Jack Lemmon 's performance is a fine one , and Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas follow . I felt so much empathy of Lemmon , who 's character Jack Godell , only wanted people to listen to his warning.But what impresses me most about this film is the lack of a score , and this is also what makes it beautiful to me . Apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension , because none is needed . And while the credits run , white on black , in silence it drives the point home.I use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie . I think the movie should make the movie and the music should only amplify that . But for The China Syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here . The characters portray all of this far better than the music ever could.I highly recommend this movie , it is one of my favorites . If you like movies , you won 't be disappointed . If you like movie soundtracks more , you might not want to give this one a go . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There was a lot about Little Vera that was strange to me . All in all I did enjoy this movie , but a lot of the way the characters behaved was not what I was used to . For example the environment that Vera 's family lived in was very tense . Almost every time the family was together they were either drinking , fighting or yelling and frequently it was a combination of the three . After I had viewed the film I felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place during it . I was however very interested in watching the story if this middle class Russian family . Throughout the entire film we are reminded of the industrialized state of Russia because of the repeated shots of a train passing by the screen . It gave the viewer a sense of a mechanically lived life . The characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work . There was not a feeling of happiness throughout the film . The only time a character was not yelling was when Vera first fell in love with her fianc챕 Sergei . This was very short lived because the viewer later discovers ( after Sergei locks Vera 's father in a bathroom and Vera lets him out after which the father proceeds to stab Sergei ) that he is abusive . Another time Vera is told that the only reason she was born was so the family could get a larger apartment . It is very interesting watching how both Vera and the family were able to cope with each other 's behavior . The film was definitely worth watching because of its depiction of how life could be in areas of Russia . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It doesn 't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn 't a waste of time . The production designs are just stunning in this movie . From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter . Even though this movie is over 40 years old , the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today 's cinema . The music and songs are also well done . Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail , " " I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas " " as one of the great musical moments in movies . I 'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I 'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie.-What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don 't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like " " Two Towers " " and " " Silent Hill " . " Way before today 's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place . One of my favorite shots in " " Two Towers " " is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates , the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor , and that 's what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie . They 're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they 're all just fantasy beings.-It 's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of " " Aladdin " " got their inspiration . The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet . It 's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it 's nice to know that I 'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie . I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it 's amazing . That 's a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time . Sure , the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40 's so give it a break . Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today 's standard.-If you ever wanted to see a live action version of " " Aladdin " " then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won 't be their cup of tea . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family . When Leo , the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus , announces it to his parents , they just can 't believe it . The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.The director , Christophe Honore , has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen . Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter.The news has a devastating effect on Marcel , the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted , in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality.Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this film when it was released to the minor cinemas in the UK some 50 years ago ; and the memory remains of a great musical score , and the tragedy of the storyline . I saw it again on video recently . The sound track was poor and the picture grainy ; but it is one of two films that I saw again the next day , the other being Gladiator . The music theme is intensely tragic , and from the outset one knows that it heralds failure or death . Certainly one of George Sanders best performances ; as a man working the black market to get pay back for what he lost in the war , but nemesis waits ; Patricia Roc plays a refugee from Eastern Europe eaten with despair . He is attracted to her , selflessly wants to help her , and then falls in love with her , but she is too proud and hurt to accept help . Their love destroys him , and inevetably the girl and the doctor ( Herbert Marshall ) , who brought the nemesis . The storyline is of complex intertwining destinies , where subsidiary characters are not who they appear to be . This is as a film , which diappointed the critics and struggled at the box office ; but for the adolescent who saw it , and the retired gentleman who saw it again it is one of the greatest films ( taking into account its age ) whose story is more akin to an opera . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I had my reservations about watching The Return to Lonesome Dove after seeing and enjoying the original so much . Without Tommy Lee Jones reprising his role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara , I figured it just wouldn 't seem authentic enough . Upon viewing ' return ' I can honestly say it 's a worthy successor . The actors really make the show with Jon Voight , Rick Schroder , and Oliver Reed all preforming at their very best . I admit the story might not be quite as engrossing as the first , but ' return ' definitely has it 's share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have . Anyone who still has reservations can rest assured that The Return to Lonesome Dove succeeds in capturing the ' feel ' of the original and will not disappoint .

" Road to Perdition , a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes ( and in my opinion his best work ) , a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty . This is a terrific movie , and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.It 's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the , Michael Sullivan , a father of two children , played by great Tom Hanks ( I 'm not his admirer but ought to say that ) is a hit-man for local mafia boss , played by Paul Newman . His eldest son , a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr . , perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin , after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live . Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder , committed by John Rooney , son of his father boss . Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever . The atmosphere of the period , all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created , editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written . But the main line of the movie , the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times . They are shown so deeply , strong and believable . Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb . Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful ( but one more time sad ) masterpiece . I believe Road to Perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film-making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.My grade 10 out of 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Takashi Miike 's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements . This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark . Even as a kid , I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales ; horrible things happen to people in most children 's books . Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier ( and more disturbing ) than what they appear to be at first glance . The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom . He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions . Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids . I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers . He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain . But a self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers . I thought it was a great film . Highly recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One reasons why they call the 80 's , " " The Awesome 80 's " " is quality television .

In the final scenes , there is a trial held by the reform school boys with flaming torches and a barn which is set on fire and a big leap by the corrupt warden .

" " " Yokai Daisenso " " is a children 's film by Takashi Miike , but as you might expect , it 's probably a bit too dark & scary for younger ones . However , older children may well eat this up , that is , if you play it dubbed in English.The story is that of a young boy , who has moved with his mother to the country , to live with his grandfather , after a divorce . During a village festival the boy is chosen as a " " Kirin rider " , " a great honor , but with that honor comes much danger and adventure , of course.Meanwhile , evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt , go-go boots & a beehive hair-do , teams up with an evil Yokai to turn people 's resentments and discarded items against them . And this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the City of Rage itself , Tokyo . One quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city ... says one , " " Oh , it 's only Gamera " . " The young boy has befriended Yokai , which are monsters of a kind , mostly benign , that have isolated themselves away from humans , and all the Yokai in Japan band together to fight the evil.In many ways Miike & crew have taken the late 60 's / early 70 's Yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for ( older ) kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of " " Transformers " . " The look and feel of the film is great , the effects are entertaining , and some of the humor will just sail right over kid 's heads , but still , older ones might enjoy it . As for adults , there 's not much here not to like , if you 're a fan of Japanese monster movies you 'll enjoy the heck out of this.Cool & fun stuff , kind of dark at times but perhaps that 's just Miike .. and what a wild ride . 8 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Peter Watkins ' rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutality-laced , uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape . An unapologetically left leaning anti authoritarian abuse fest , the escapades at first appear to be so over the top militaristic and sickening that it could come off as some distant fantastical dystopian alternate history , one Harry Turtledove would even enjoy . But once we delve deeper in and really pay attention to the abhorrent diatribe spouting out of those presiding over the tent topped tribunal , as well as the shotgun toting guards overseeing the bloody affair , our eyes are truly opened . Suddenly we realize just how prescient Watkins ' film-making is , as much of this is the kind of neo-con talking points about youth culture and the legality of divergent thought tossed around by politicians today . Granted , much of it was drivel pouring out then as well , but it really shows us how little has changed , and informs of how , in some ways , we are closer to such a world where Punishment Parks would be a real and frightening operation.The main players in nearly every scene are seasoned non actors , mostly chosen for their rash political views and desire to get them on camera . This lends an unprecedented heap of authenticity to the entire experience as we never , even for a second , question the reality of all the chaos . Shot documentary style with 16mm film , this appears like a gritty documentation of some despicable government test project that was classified until found years later . At least it appears to have that history to it now , maybe not as much when it was ( barely ) released . But this gives an added weight to all the proceedings and helps draw you into this incredible not-so-alternate universe of torture for convicted dissidents . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic . This film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent . Without Dudley Moore , John Gielgud , Liza Minnelli , and a few others , this film could have been a disaster . It is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood ( the " " psycho " " -like music at the wedding fight ) , but the acting overcomes it . The character Arthur is hilarious , with his drunken comments . But he develops well into a more mature , well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will .

He gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can 't care for him anymore that will break your heart .

" Scoop * * * out of * * * * Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director , but I enjoyed " " Match Point . " " It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen . It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it . " " Scoop " " is Woody Allen 's latest film and though he appears in this one , it 's OK . It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together.Johansson plays Sondra Pransky , a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel ( Ian McShane . ) Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken . One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman ( Hugh Jackman . ) She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England . Joe , with the scoop of a life time , travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra , during a magic act . Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman ( Woody Allen . ) She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box , she gets the visit from Joe . Not knowing what to do , she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case.This film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to " " Match Point " " and yet it all works . Johansson and Allen work great together . Allen 's humor fits perfect for this story and role . Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman , the " " suspected " " serial killer.This is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch . The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself . I say give it a chance because you just might like it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of the best action films I have seen . Geena 's portrayal of the tough as nails , ' Charly ' / gentle mother ' Sam ' , was superb and Samuel L Jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through , with his classic one liners . Sure , there were a few holes in the actual story , but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.I felt Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam / Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie ' Stuart Little ' . Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse , Brian Cox , sweet little Yvonne Zima and newcomers , sexy Craig Bierko , and Melina Kanakaredes . This film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the diversion away from traditional male / female stereotypes as we see Sam / Charly ( Davis ) and Mitch ( Jackson ) hurtling from one disaster to the next.While I and many others loved this movie , it is fair to say that there will always be people that don 't and that 's fine - each , to their own . I highly recommend this film to action fans , for its hilarious scenes and fast-paced action . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As is often the case , films about self-loathing characters do not usually make for good drama . ' Downloading Nancy ' is no exception . It 's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who 's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet.The protagonist is Nancy ( Maria Bello ) who is married to Albert ( Rufus Sewell ) . Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar / restaurants . Unlike most human beings , Albert has virtually no positive attributes ( except for his ability to be successful in the business world ) . Throughout the film , Albert has a grim and dour expression on his face . He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes . When his wife asks for sex , he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead.Nancy is equally one-note as a character . Not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up ( thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film ) . Her self-loathing takes the form of self-mutilation and a result , she 's forced into therapy . However , she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made.Finally , Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis over the internet . He 's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo , who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot . It 's revealed that Louis has two children but no longer sees them ( the children 's mother no longer wants anything to do with him ) .Nancy 's plan is to first have painful sex with Louis and then have him kill her . There 's a particularly unpleasant scene where Louis has sex with Nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass . These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis pays a visit to Albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club . It seems that Louis has a two-fold plan in going to see Albert : 1 ) berate him for his treatment of Nancy and 2 ) enjoy the beating he receives . It takes awhile before Louis will reveal Nancy 's fate혰first , he forces Albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future . Nancy 's fate of course is that Louis finally ended up choking her to death ( but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some ' feelings ' for her ) . We soon learn that Louis is imprisoned for life for Nancy 's murder.What exactly are we to take away from a film such as Downloading Nancy ? Are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence ? Is that the main point of the film ? Is sympathy for Nancy actually warranted ? I don 't think so . The film 's writers create a straw man in the character of Albert혰someone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for Nancy 's decline . But are people so one-dimensional in real life ? I think not . They have the repulsive Louis , a man who makes a living by inflicting pain , come over and berate Albert for neglecting Nancy . Furthermore , his expressions of love towards Nancy ( before he kills her ) , is supposed to show his ' sensitive side ' .In the end , it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film . They are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence , that Downloading Nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" No doubt intended as a totally campy joke , " " Full Moon High " " portrays 1950s teenager Tony Walker ( Adam Arkin ) accompanying his father ( Ed McMahon ) on a trip to Romania . Sure enough , Tony gets bitten , and grows fur and fangs whenever there 's a full moon . A particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can 't age as long as he has the werewolf curse , and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years.But otherwise , the movie 's just plain funny once it gets going . Ed McMahon 's character is an over-patriotic right-wing yahoo ( he thinks that everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy ) , Kenneth Mars 's coach / principal is a tense dweeb , and then there 's more . One of the most eye-opening cast members is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont on " " Sanford and Son " " - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise . But probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents ; then gag with Gerald Ford really summed him up ! Anyway , it 's a real treat . Considering that Alan Arkin - who plays a zany psychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his sons , I wonder whether or not he remembers co-starring with two of them in this movie ( aside from Adam , his son Anthony also has a small role ) .

" Describing Stalingrad as a war film may be a bit inaccurate . Sure it centers on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history , in the most expansive theater of the most costly war in terms of lives , money , and mat챕riel that has ever occurred . Yes it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction . The visceral storytelling and harsh images though make it something more than a war film , even more than an anti-war film . Stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and undeniable hell.The film is fraught with visual descriptions of the worst kind of war , one that is intensely personal and close , where days are spent in taking one city block , only to have it re-taken in a surprise assault . The early form of modern urban warfare that the Germans came to call Rattenkrieg ( Rat Warfare ) is depicted in brutal and uncompromising terms . The characters war in sewer tunnels , rail yards , and from building to building in the hellish bomb-scape of ruined Stalingrad , only to be defeated by the unforgiving Russian winter.The film deals with the issue of Nazism and the vilification of Germans in that period in the way that many other films from both Germany and the rest of the world do . Its characters are a group of soldiers swept along by the winds of war and simply attempting to make it out with themselves and as many of their comrades as possible alive . The characters do not fight the Soviets out of any ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet Communism , not for any grand dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority . They fight only because if they do not the enemy will kill them , and if the enemy does not then their own officers certainly will for refusing to fight . This portrayal adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that pervades the film.A sort of ground based companion to Das Boot , Stalingrad frames the epic struggle of World War Two in a personal light and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary German soldier as a sort of hero made tragic by circumstance and a brutal government that would pervert his sacrifice . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Composed , elegant Carol ( marvelously played by the beautiful Rebecca Brooke ) , her nice husband Eddie ( likable David Houseman ) , Carol 's wacky , constantly eating best gal pal Anna ( delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable Chris Jordan ) , and Anna 's hunky , amorous husband Pete ( a typically fine Eric Edwards ) are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other . Their usual routine gets disrupted when Carol 's lonely , repressed , but still alluring widow mother Jennifer ( a superbly moving performance by the lovely Jennifer Welles ) drops by for a visit . Pretty soon Jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers ' blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle , with everyone except Carol eager to seduce her . Writer / director Joe Sarno concocts a sharp , engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild 'n'easy 70 's sexual revolution ; Sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother / daughter incest subplot . Moreover , Sarno elicits uniformly first-rate acting from the bang-up cast : Welles and Brooke are both exceptional , with excellent support from Edwards , Jordan , Houseman , Arlana Blue as flaky New Age sex therapist Shandara , and Erica Eaton as saucy neighbor Mrs. Fields . Better still , all the women are extremely hot and enticing ; Welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence . The sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit , but never raunchy or tedious . Stephen Colwell 's bright , polished cinematography and Jack Justis ' bouncy , melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective . Recommended viewing for Sarno fans . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" No , there is another ! Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion about I , II & III and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy , I will state the good points of " " The Return of the Jedi " " and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel . Of course , I loved the music , the special effects , the two droids , but this has been overly debated elsewhere.What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie : - A strong ecological concern - Anti-militarist positions - Fascinating insights about the Jedi Order and the Force - Cute creatures - Harrison Ford 's smile - A killer scene : Near the ending , when Vader looks alternatively at his son and at the Emperor . The lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his Black helmet . And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save Luke , thereby risking his own life ! Oh , boy ! What is wrong in the prequel INMHO : - the whole " " human factor " " element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - The Force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults , than about wisdom - Too many Jedis at once and too many Light Sabers on the screen - The lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot By the way , if you enjoy the theory of the Force as explained by Obi Web ( Obi Wen , I mean ) and Yoda , then you should read a few books about Buddhism and the forms it took in Ancient Japan.The magic of Star Wars , IMHO lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice , from a father to his son , albeit the difficulties .

" I absolutely love this show , but I saw the second episode first . After watching the first episode I could see why people were turned off at first . The first episode 's humor is not the best , and they struggle to properly start the series . However , I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show . The characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters . As a first episode , it really doesn 't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good . The episode is not bad by any means , but as the show progresses it becomes better and better , so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Broken Bow " " takes us back to where it all began . Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk , Spock and McCoy . This installment of the " " Star Trek " " franchise , is in my opinion the first series since " " TOS " " to recapture the feelings of wonder , danger and excitement of " " Going Where No Man Has Gone Before " . " Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer , the first Captain of the first " " Star Ship Enterprise " . " He and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the Star Trek legacy . John Billingsley is Brilliant as the alien Dr. Phlox , and Jolene Blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical Vulcan science officer T 'Pol . Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the Treks , and I believe Gene Roddenberry would surely be proud . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Du rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film which studies criminal minds and allows viewers to have a better understanding of criminals who are fundamentally not different from ordinary folks like us.What director Jules Dassin shows is that criminal do have families and they care a lot for them.That is why they adhere to a strict code of honor . For them a family is not only made up of wives , mistresses and children but also include casual acquaintances and close friends.Contrary to what many might find it hard to believe , Jules Dassin has not tried to glorify crime in his film as rififi makes it clear that crime never pays.It shows that all kinds of bad activities result in some kind of human loss.Apart from its philosophical stance Rifif is worth watching for its technical finesse.While watching one of the film 's most brilliant sequences about breaking of a safe , one would find it hard to believe meticulous precision with which criminal minds execute their plans.This is a scene which nobody has dared to copy in Hollywood . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" AristoCats is such a terrific Disney classic that I just loved so much as a kid . Still to this day I can 't resist watching it , it 's just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and lovely songs . I really miss the animation films like AristoCats , they had perfect voices not to mention the hand drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family . AristoCats is also very witty and clever , the story was just so wonderful . This film is just beyond irresistible , I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the appecio 's , lol , it was just so cute with the piano playing and painting.Douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion , mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like they were her children . But when the lady feels it 's time to make her will , she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler . The butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abondons them in the middle of no where . Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of Thomas O 'Malley , they head back home to their lady , but learn the coolness of being a skat cat.The AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that I feel is a bit over looked . I would always highly recommend this movie for kids or families , it could be enjoyed by anyone . The songs and story is just memorable . I will always join in for the movies best song " " Everybody wants to be a cat " , " such a great tune . I also love those dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned , they were just so cute . This is a terrific film , please watch it , you won 't be disappointed.9 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie . It 's April 8 , 1994 , each of the characters are in their " " mid 20 's " " and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition ( acting , music , film , writing ) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain 's suicide . They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil . It 's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes . Highlights include : a visit to Jimi Hendirx 's grave , Kurt Cobain 's original childhood home and a campfire sing along . An honest an original piece of work . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For those who loved " " Wayne 's World " ... " " " The Blues Brothers " ... " and hell , even " " Raiders of the Lost Ark , " " you will find much to like ( but probably not love ) in " " Tenacious D : The Pick of Destiny , " " a fictional epic about the formation of the JB ( Jack Black ) / KG ( Kyle Gass ) band . Two out-of-work losers with a love for rock n 'roll are met with a dilemma when KG 's long-supportive mother stops sending him rent checks ; JB and KG make tracks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after a sage music-store clerk ( an inspired Ben Stiller ) tells them about the titular pick ( a funny animated-tapestry sequence gives the backstory ) . Along the way , our zeroes encounter a snaggle-toothed stranger ( a game Tim Robbins ) , Sasquatch , stoner security guards , sorority chicks , and Satan himself ( an ironically-cast Dave Grohl ) , in a climactic sequence that has to be seen to be believed ( and preferably played at high volume ) . Rarely do I see comedies in the theater , but " " Pick " " is an extremely nice change of pace ... it may not go up to 11 , but it hums a tune both crude and clever for a good 90 minutes . And the songs are inspired low-brow hilarity . Recommended.6.5 out of 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Great movie ! oh yeah ! Full of energy , full of fun , presenting our generation , our alienation : a hymn to positive thinking despite this world we live in , a tale of a great party , a tale of a bunch of friends who desperately must do something in a week end and the only thing to do is The Club .

" A prequel to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series , from the same creative team Ronald D. Moore and David Eick as well as new series co-creator Remi Aubuchon . Caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of Battlestar Galactica . The new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the Cylon race.The pilot and the series are set to follow two families ; the Graystone 's which include Daniel ( Eric Stoltz ) a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter Zoe ( Alessandra Toreson ) , while the Adama 's include Joseph ( Esai Morales ) a lawyer and his son William the future Admiral of Battlestar Galactica.Like Battlestar Galactica the series includes some great experienced actors in Eric Stoltz , Esai Morales and Polly Walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz.For fans of Battlestar Gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series but it is also very different . In the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series . The scenes on Caprica while reflecting a more technologically advanced society also have retro feel , this is achieved through some of the architecture , the costumes and the way it is shot.While the look and feel of the two series have some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar , religion is again very important here , while the racial theme rarely touched on in BG is far more important . We also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have one , as well as issues related to crime and government.The pilot has been released direct to DVD in an extended and unrated version prior to airing on TV , the series is set to start in 2010.Like Battlestar Galactica this series is filmed in Vancouver , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First time I ever saw this was at a friends house . It ended up in his parents hands by a fluke ; some videostore / bicycle repair shop ! ! went bankrupt and treats like this was up for grabs . We saw it two times in a row and almost wet are pants how hard we laughed . I 've seen historical documents like Ninja Mission and Plan 9 from Outer Space , and they still remain good runners-up in comparison to this one . Almost 15 years after first contact it is now considered the best cult movie of all times ( in my circles ) ; I 've showed it to all my friends ... We now have a tradition of searching for movies in the same category : the un-rateable one.It can 't be explained or reviewed in any normal way because every scene , every take , every move , contains at least one mistake regarding editing , dialouge , directing etc.For any cult-movie buff this is the ultimate prize , the gem of all gems.Raiting : As for craft it can 't be rated , because it would even be an insult to homemade videos of birthdays and weddings.As for pure amusement it is the funniest movie I have ever seen ; funnier than any comedy ever made past or present .

" Inspired at least a little by Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra , who performed throughout the war years at the Covent Garden Opera house , this film chronicles the attempts by an elderly saxophone player to reform the ( almost ) all girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the end of WWII . All too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music , and help to fill in the background to the band members , and in particular to the girls ' relationships with the lone male member - their transvestite drummer ( who is trying to dodge the call-up ) .Ian Holm ( " " Lord of The Rings " , " " " Cromwell and Fairfax " " ) and Judi Dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed Elizabeth , and the conniving , womanizing Patrick , the drummer . The late Joan Sims is perfect as the band 's leader , now playing bar piano at the sea-side , and June Whitfield glows as the Salvation Army trombone player . Cameo appearances by other greats like Cleo Laine , Leslie Caron , Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience . The movie is a romp down memory lane , with an all star cast of what ought , by all rights , to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses . All I can say is , I hope I look as good at their age ! Leslie Caron , in particular , is still an incredible fox , at 69 years of age . She certainly still gets my pulse going ! As I watched it , I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age . Afterwards , I looked these girls up , and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the London of 1944 ( although this might be a bit of a stretch for Judi Dench ) .If you like swing bands , thrive on nostalgia , or just want to see how good a woman can manage look with almost three quarters of a century behind her , don 't miss this film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " In the Mood for Love " " a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing . Here is a film without sex , or even kissing -- and it is no doubt one of the sexiest and definetly the most thought-provoking and psychological romance I have ever seen.Telling the story of two people who coincidentally , live in the same apartment , and are a door away from each other . The film , like and unlike " " Random Hearts , " " is about how two people come together via the affair of their two lovers . Only once they receive this news , they take the time to think about the consequences of an affair , and each other 's feelings towards having just broken-up -- and whether or not the two people are willing enough to fall back in love.What 's terrific about the film is the way director Wong Kar-Wai , presents each character 's way of dealing with loneliness . With Maggie Cheung 's character , he 'll show her , in a repeated montage : leaving work , going home , watching her neighbors gamble , head to the noodle shop , leave the noodle shop , and bump into her attractive age-equal , played by Tony Leung . This is a clever , if not subtle and knowing technique to present loneliness . For it is when you are alone , when you find yourself falling into a loop . This movie worked for me because I can identify with that feeling . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences . The worst one is the lack of closet space ! Some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full ! Melvin Frank and Norman Panama , a great comedy writing team from that era , saw the potential in Eric Hodgins novel , whose hero , Jim Blandings , can 't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife Muriel , and two daughters , must share.Jim Blandings , a Madison Ave. executive , has had it ! When he sees an ad for Connecticut living , he decides to take a look . Obviously , a first time owner , Jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent . This is only the beginning of his problems.Whatever could be wrong , goes wrong . The architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn 't work for the new house , after the original one is razed . As one problem leads to another , more money is necessary , and whatever was going to be the original cost , ends up in an inflated price that Jim could not really afford.The film is fun because of the three principals in it . Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of Jim Blandings . Myrna Loy , was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite Mr. Grant . The third character , Bill Cole , an old boyfriend of Myrna , turned lawyer for the Blandings , is suave and debonair , the way Melvin Douglas portrayed him . One of the Blandings girls , Joan , is played by Sharyn Moffett , who bore an uncanny resemblance to Eva Marie Saint . The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie , but doesn 't have much to do.The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe , who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better . The direction of H.C. Potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First I have to admit that I have had some doubts about the director . He has done some movies ( with Jarkovsky ) about the recent " " czech = east " " history or more precisely about families ( individuals ) how did they survive some historical moments . But it was always like the chines food sour-sweet . This movie was totally different . It was pure , it shows the bones of life , it shows the variations of human natures . This film is an excellent piece of art ( story , acting , picture , music ) but it shows you the life around you in much brighter light that we don 't want to see . By the way I have saw it on a DVD ( with English subtitles ) but I am afraid that in the USA I wont be able to get it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The Railway Children is perhaps my favorite film of all time simply for the brilliant acting of the cast , the warm , humane interaction of the 3 children and the people they encounter living near the railway in the beautiful English countryside . Jenny Augutter is especially believable in her role as ' Bobbie ' the older sibling of her sister Phyllis and brother Peter.The adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinating.The scenery is lovely , the trains a part of Britain 's vast history and the soundtrack is very moving . This heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyes , each and every time as well as makes me homesick.I often wonder if I should have been born in that era as I think I would have fitted in just fine as people treated each other with such chivalry and decency.In short I consider this film somewhat of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a ' sensitive or caring type ' .Edith Nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900 's and what a wonderful story it is.More kids today need to read this or see the film instead of playing violent video games.If we had more films of this nature , the world would become a better place . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu ( 1976 ) is a vastly underrated early work by director John Woo . The film stars Dorian Tan ( Tan Tao-liang ) and features Jackie Chan , Sammo Hung and James Tien in significant supporting roles . Many people believe , or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising , that this is a Jackie Chan film . This is not a Jackie Chan film , Dorian Tan is the star but Jackie gives one of his best ( most serious ) early performances.The Hand of Death is about a Shaolin disciple named Yunfei ( Tan ) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a Shaolin traitor named Shih Xiaofeng ( Tien ) and protect a revolutionary named Zhang Yi ( Woo ) . Along his journey Yunfei meets up with a young woodcutter named Tan ( Chan ) and a disgraced sword fighter ( Chang Chung ) known as " " the wanderer . " " Both men have suffered at the hands of Shih and want to take revenge . The three team up to defeat Shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety.The martial arts action is above average under the direction of Sammo Hung . Dorian Tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the " " Northern eighteen styles kicks " " along with some " " Southern five styles boxing . " " Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well . James Tien is not the greatest martial artist on the Jade screen but does an acceptable job . Some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring Chan , Tan and Hung are very good.Director John Woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film , which is refreshing . The cinematography by Leung Wing Kat is very stylish , unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era . Joseph Koo 's music : a combination of soft flutes and 70 's " " Shaft " " style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best . Hand of Death is not Jackie and Sammo 's usual kung fu comedy . Hand of Death is a serious , straightforward revenge driven story.Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre . The film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung . Hung 's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and Chan 's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen.Hand of Death is a solid , stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary John Woo.Kung Fu Genre Rating 7.5 / 10 Wanderer to Tan ( referring to his new weapon ) : " " The Little Eagle Wing God Lance .

" This Bravo special is one of the most purely entertaining things I 've ever seen on TV . Unlike Me First & The Gimme Gimmes ( the worlds foremost Punk-Supergroup / Cover-Band ) , The Dan Band really must be seen to be appreciated.On paper , The Dan Band is just a one-joke act- guy sings girly songs and inserts gratuitous profanity into the lyrics . If you listen to their " " Dan Band Live " " CD , that 's all you 'll get , and it 'll get old quick . ( I only bought it because it had some songs that weren 't on the TV special . ) But what 's made Dan Finnerty a Hollywood cult hero is his amazing stage presence . This guy OWNS his audience for every second he 's onstage . And the backup singers are a large part of the visual punchline as well . As for the actual band- they stay out of sight for the most part , but are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical lounge-act backing band . Hopefully , a DVD version will be released soon- there were almost certainly some songs cut and although the heavy censoring adds a bit of unintentional humor , it also removes the INTENTIONAL humor.If there is any sense in the world , the Vegas casino owners will soon be fighting over who can build Dan his own showroom faster .

" People who know me say I have a weakness for animated films.To be fair , those people are HALF right My actual weakness is for exceptionally well-done animated films , such as this vintage family flick from Max and David Fleischer.You may be thinking to yourself , " " well if it 's so great , why haven 't I heard of it ? " " Fair question . This movie was released the same week as the attacks on Pearl Harbor . The unavoidably bad timing caused the film to sink into relative obscurity . Things are looking up , though , because it has finally been released on DVD under the title " " BUGVILLE " . " It 's funny that the film went through all this , because it kind of mirrors the actual plot . Although some people claim that the movie is trying to send an environmental message ( ugh ) , I personally think that the movie 's main idea is perseverance through adversity and hard times ( after all , the country had barely pulled out of the Depression at the time ) .Our grasshopper hero , Hoppity , desperately wants to help his endangered community . Problem : each time he tries , whether through the ill-will of others or through simple bad luck , he fails miserably ... and slowly begins to earn the disdain of the very people he 's trying to save . Although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook , he occasionally breaks down and it 's only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets back on his feet and fights the good fight . Just a healthy reminder that , when all is said and done , no one is really self-sufficient . " " Okay " , " you 're saying . " " It has a good message ( two actually ) . Does that really make it EXCEPTIONALLY WELL-DONE ? " " My answer : Partially.It 's not just the message that makes this movie special . It 's the characterization . This is one of those films where you can just see the personality of each cast member in their animation . You almost don 't even need the spoken lines . A good way to sum it all up is " " energetic " " or " " lively " . " A lot of movies have used the selling point , " " lovable cast of characters " . " Whenever I hear that line , it always makes me think of this movie.Case in point , the bad guys : Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito . Many movies have " " lovable " " villains , but I don 't think you 'll find any as entertaining or endearing as these fellows . Forget that 3 Stooges Cartoon from the 60s . Swat and Smack are the closest thing to an animated version of Moe and Curly ( but sadly not Larry ) that you 'll ever find . Virtually all of the funniest moments somehow involve this gruesome twosome . Yeah , they 're rotten no-goodniks , but you still care about them . That 's the kind of power you only see from a really talented writer , director , and crew.The movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes ( Native Americans and Chinese ) . I don 't think they were intended to be malicious ; but they 're there , regardless . They didn 't bother me , but it 'd be pretty unfair of me not to warn someone who potentially would be bothered by them.So , if you share my weakness ( and I think you do ) , give this one a go . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" During my teens or should I say prime time I was " " eating up " " all kinds of SF novels every day of the week . It was in the Sixties and Seventies when TV was not such a important leisure time killer like today , one night in the mid seventies I watched the movie on TV I think it was ARD and I was stunned . I was impressed in a way that I can almost remember each scene even today.Nowadays I observe my kids playing the SIMS or something like that and I think we are close to what that Fassbender Movie expressed . I also would highly appreciate if I could buy this movie on a DVD . But in vain I tried almost everything to get a hint where .

" Contrary to the comment posted directly below , The Big Trail ( 1930 ) was not filmed in a three-camera process " " much like the later Cinerama . " " That was the finale to Napoleon ( 1927 ) , a different film entirely ! The Big Trail was simultaneously shot in both 35mm and 70mm ( Grandeur ) versions , and both versions are shown on Fox Movie Channel from time to time , so it 's easy to compare one with the other . The Grandeur version ( broadcast in letterbox @ approximately its original 2-1 ratio ) is more impressive cinematically with its wide angle panoramas , but suffers from the same problem that beset early CinemaScopes , a lack of close-ups forced upon director Raoul Walsh because of focus problems . Scenes involving individuals rather than crowds or long shots are much more effective in the standard version because the camera can move closer to the players thereby achieving a greater sense of involvement for the viewer . Watching the two versions simultaneously , one gets an accurate idea of which shots Walsh chose to shoot close-up , in the standard version , but could not , in the Grandeur version . There are also a couple sequences involving El Brendel : a shell game with Ian Keith , and some business with his wife & a jackass , which are in the Grandeur version , but missing from the standard version.For the record , The Big Trail is the only one of three Fox Grandeur films which has survived in its original wide screen format . ( The other two are Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 , completely lost , and Happy Days , which survives only in standard format . ) Other studios also experimented with wide film at this time , but the only other one still known to exist in both formats is The Bat Whispers , filmed in both 65mm and 35mm , and released by United Artists . Other wide films were MGM 's Billy the Kid ( 1930 ) and The Great Meadow ( 1931 ) , RKO 's Danger Lights ( 1930 ) , and WB 's The Lash ( 1930 ) , all of which can be seen in their standard format versions on Turner Classic Movies . WB 's Kismet ( 1930 ) was also filmed both wide and standard , but seems to have completely disappeared ; it is rumored to be lost.Why did wide film fail in 1930 ? Theaters were reeling ( pun intended ) under the impact of the stock market crash of October 1929 , and the spiraling costs of installing sound equipment , and so were adverse to taking on the added expense of installing additional new projection equipment and new wider screens to accommodate just a handful of films , photographed in a variety of different systems that were not even always compatible with each other . It would not be until 1953 when Fox , now Twentieth Century-Fox , would try again , and this time succeed , with the introduction of wide screen CinemaScope . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney wasn 't in the role . Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES ? I mean , it 's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too , but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama . The boys work great with Garfield . A nice sequence was the whole " " swimming " " scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment : Claude Rains was grossly miscast . As the detective , the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

You may think by the opening titles it 's going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life . This film feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes of images , but still refreshing . This story is also about Eros and Thanatos . " " It 's not an original joke but it is well told " " says a character and that also applies to this one : We 've seen the story but this way we see it .

" This is the first American film to successfully adopt the naturalistic style used by Europeans , particularly the French and Belgians , for at least a decade , and isn 't it about time ? Following three high school girls in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn during the last days of their summer break between freshman and sophomore years , it does what all good art should : it discovers the universal in the particular . Even though the girls ' preoccupations are outwardly conventional--boys , sex , popularity , money , freedom , and clothes--we glimpse how their whole lives are being shaped , the universal interface between character and destiny.The naturalism is whole , complete . The film breathes , stays in the moment , inhabits real time . The story tells itself . The medium and its artifacts , for once , are not the message . The film unwaveringly , truthfully conveys the childhood perspective of its characters ; it does not impose its own adult meanings or morals . Details emerge of their own , are never pushed , and thus seem all the more real and powerful for their understatement . Even though great pains have been taken to capture the authentic social reality of Crown Heights , part of the largest Black ghetto in New York City and one of the most dangerous violent places in the US , the subject is childhood in the ghetto , not the ghetto itself.Documentary footage of the practice sessions of a marching band , the Jackie Robinson Steppers , punctuate the film at regular intervals with an explosion of color , movement , and sound . Otherwise , the camera stays very close , very intimate , a patient , sly , and unobtrusive observer . The language is rich , spontaneous , the acting transparent . Some scenes standout , such as the girls lolling about , each revealing her deepest fantasies . Lanisha 's confession of her acceptance of a death by random violence is the most shocking , one of the deepest scars of the ghetto . Her sharing with her mother her confusion and fear before the stark challenges of adult life is equally moving , and beautifully , unsentimentally affirmative.Social realities are respected , not propagandized : All three girls are being raised by single moms , only one , Lanisha , has a father active in her life ( and , not coincidentally , of the three she is the most emotionally stable and empathetic to others , and the one with the most self-respect ) . Two of them suffer from asthma , a disease disproportionately prevalent in the inner city . Gunfire , an accepted daily occurrence , only momentarily interrupts their conversation . Only one of the girls , Joy , feels hope for , feels she has control over the future , while the other two to varying degrees have already accepted despair.This is by far the best dramatic American film I 've seen in years .

" BIG FAT LIAR , in my opinion , is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it . When Jason ( Frankie Muniz - " " MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE " " ) and Kaylee ( Amanda Bynes - " " ALL THAT " " ) played those tricks on Marty ( Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE ) , I really smiled and felt good . That 's what I liked most about this movie . As a matter of fact , everything that happened after Jason 's essay erroneously ended up in Marty 's hands was hilarious . I especially loved Jaleel White 's cameo . When I first saw him , I couldn 't be certain , but , when I asked my mother if it was him , she said , " " Of course ! " " Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say , " " Like I said earlier , there is a moral to this story , and that moral is , always tell the truth . " " Now , in conclusion , if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz , Amanda Bynes , or Paul Giamatti , I highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Recovery is a well-judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that doesn 't sentimentalise the main characters . David Tennant and Sarah Parish bring to the fore the complex and conflicting emotions of a couple deeply in love struggling to come to terms with the personality changes they both endure and also must make to survive a tragic accident.Tennant , as Alan , brings humour as well as a dangerous lecherousness , as an engineer recovering from a memory loss brought on by a road accident . Alan is not portrayed simply as a victim but as human being with feelings doing the best he can to make sense of his new life . Sarah Parish 's Tricia is not a clich챕d stand-by-her-man housewife who will do anything to support her husband . She struggles with falling out of love with Alan , as the man she once new and loved is now a completely different person - a stranger to her.Contrary to some opinion , this - in my view - makes perfect Sunday night viewing . Too often , we are shown soft family dramas or detective series , like Heartbeat , which rot and putrefy the brain . Programme commissioners seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep . More challenging and thought-provoking drama like Recovery would seriously change the situation . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the Windy City , contrarian director Otto Preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his movie appear as artificial as possible , thus flying in the face of the fashion set by men like Kazan , Huston and Zinnemann , who were making their pictures all over the world . Nelson Algren , on whose novel the movie is based , went on record as despising it . What , one wonders , was Preminger up to , and why did he do the movie this way ? The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a Mr. Magoo cartoon . Louie , the drug pusher , is attired as to resemble the sort of gangster the artists at Mad magazine used to draw . Arnold Stang , wonderful comedian that he was , seems out of place in a serious picture like this , and his very appearance , topped off by an exaggerated and over-sized baseball cap , elicits laughter . Robert Strauss , another actor best known for humorous roles , is likewise out of place , as his large , heavily jowled face and Runyonesque delivery of lines seems more appropriate to a Jerry Lewis movie . Against all this , stars Frank Sinatra , Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overtime to just keep the viewer from snickering . Sinatra is jittery and manic throughout , suggesting a man ill at ease with himself , hence wholly appropriate for the role of a drug addict . Miss Novak , plant-like and sublimely deadpan , is sympathetic and seems a product of the artfully dingy slums she graces in the film . Parker is pure Hollywood and very hard-working as the crippled and crafty Zosch . She is never convincing , but then neither is the film.I wouldn 't recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of the lives of drug addicts in America . The Caligari sets alone make it unbelievable . Preminger may have been aiming for a dream effect , as the cardboard backgrounds give the proceedings the surreal feeling of a nightmare operetta , perhaps harking back to Preminger 's early days in Vienna . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities I think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb.It 's your basic ' who done it ? ' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end . I like these kinds of movies and I certainly think this one meets the standard.To me it was worth watching more than once so I 'll give it an 8 on imdb . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Ghost Walks is a nifty little mystery with a great twist , snappy dialog , and best of all a pansy played to the twittery hilt by character actor Johnny Arthur which never demeans or denigrates his character . Mr. Arthur is great in his role of Homer Erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the Broadway producer Herman Wood , played by another great character actor Richard Carle.They play off of each other superbly.Although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of Homer , it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration , and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer , who fires and rehires him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee.There is a great scene where Homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him.The mystery angle of the film is very entertaining , and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches.For a low budget poverty row picture , this film has superb set decoration and great costuming.Director Frank Strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts , but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through.This film is a must see for devotees of poverty row films , old dark house mysteries ( they actually managed to work in the lines " " It was a dark and stormy night ) and it has the added bonus of being an early representation of a gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end.This movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the Internet Archive at archive.org. , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am no Ebert . What I am is a compassionate and I have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than I felt for Leland P. Fitzgerald . Sorry if I do not offer a critique , but I see nothing but perfection in this film . I am sure that many who watch this film will never see the same things I do , but if you look hard enough maybe you will see something you weren 't expecting . I 've read that the character of Leland was flawed . It seems to me that who wrote this was not able to see past the Question this movie presents . I feel sorry for anyone who doesn 't see the answers this movie delivers . Open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this Leland P.

" This is one of my all-time favorite films , and while it may move too slowly for some , it 's well worth seeing . A corporate lawyer ( Richard Chamberlain ) is dragged into a case involving " " city " " Aborigines , and this is no ordinary case . OK , a man has died but it wasn 't exactly a normal killing . There has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately , and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & oppressive . The Aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans . This has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about " " City " " vs. " " Tribal " " Aborigines , and of course no Abo in the big city would practice tribal ways . Uh huh . Chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what 's happening , although no matter how many times I 've seen this I can 't quite grasp the exact connection . This is a very eerie and creepy film , and is a fine example of Peter Weir 's ability to create tension out of nothing . The ending is a little ambiguous but I take it literally , it 's the easiest way out and the scariest . 10 out of 10 and highly recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Based on Elmore Leonard , this is a violent and intelligent action film . The story : a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals . Roy Schieder does great job as the leading character and special credit 's got to go to John Glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath . I must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action film. also features some beautiful and sexy women - most notable are Kelly Preston as the young bate for Schieder 's character . Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers . I 'm glad to say that Ann-Margaret still hasn 't lost it - this lady is a true babe . Don 't look at the rate of this film . I really don 't know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under-rated film .

" It is now clear that the true golden age of American film was from the mid-60s until just before the release of Star Wars . Before then , there was too much Hays Code-constricted pap . With Star Wars , the green light was lit for most films to be directed at children and morons , a practice which continues to this day . THE SEVEN-UPS , truth be told , contains a couple hackneyed lines of dialogue -- " " We can do this the easy way , or we can do it the hard way " " is one -- but I 'm damned if I can find anything else wrong with it . ( In fact , that line may not even have been stale when this film was made . ) THE SEVEN-UPS demonstrates all that was right with the best films of the golden age : sparse dialogue , realistic acting , real locations ( winter in a dirty New York has never looked better / worse ) , propulsive stories , and , yes , the best car chase ever filmed . Bill Hickman is the driver Scheider is chasing ( you will recognize him from Bullitt ) , and the structure of the chase is fairly similar to the McQueen one , but I prefer Scheider 's facial intensity here , the pacing , the terrific close-ups of the schoolchildren , and the shattering conclusion . ( That VW bug going about 2 mph always bothers me in the Bullitt chase . ) A stringy , screechy score by Don Ellis sets the perfect mood . THE SEVEN UPS : bleak , grim , action-oriented , grown-up . This is a film that couldn 't be made today ; there 's no " " gimmick " " for the kiddies or preposterous ending . Thank you , Philip D 'Antoni , Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco : for as long as cop films are watched , THE SEVEN-UPS and its 1970s brethren ( e.g. , THE FRENCH CONNECTION ) , will set the standard . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" At times I really wonder혚 when I look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than I have . I 've just seen it ... and liked it . Not in the way , that it made me happy , but in the way of having seen a good film ! The film needs some patience , yes . And yes , the main character is REALLY annoying , but that I 'm sure is by intention.Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home . Most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music . This movie definitely doesn 't fit as background noise.And no . Good directing doesn 't mean having five laughs or explosions a second . Good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together . And while that doesn 't work out perfectly , at least I think it works quite good.I liked the photography and sets , even if they brink on the surreal at times . The opening scene is really special.I also liked the acting 혯 Guillaume Depardieu is NOT playing Pierre . He is acting the role of a Pierre who is himself playing a role ! Pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be , he is a presumptuous and self-righteous idiot , a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect . That even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself.People are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff : No character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained , there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone.And even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen : Remember that Isabelle fled from a war zone - and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war , most likely Bosnia ( which was still going on , when the film was produced ) . At least that 's what is hinted at by the story Isabelle tells Pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover , which is surrounded by books on Bosnia . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When you start watching this animation-masterpiece , you quickly notice , that it 's a European production . Although the Europeans have ( sadly ) integrated some of the clich챕s you would normally find in an American production of this kind , most are missing . One of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our ( very few and very unlikely ) heroes can vanquish . Another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money , is greedy , runs away when the heat is up but somehow gives in to his better nature . This movie would have been better off without both.The movie is based upon a TV-Series that was out four years before the movie . Unlike the movie , the TV-Series is a cartoon and not a computer animation . At first I thought the computer would kill the charm and character of the plot but I was quickliy convinced : Whoever did the animation knew his or her stuff ! Although the characters are obviously fictional ( in stills they don 't even look real ) , they seem as alive and sentient as the audience following their quest . Making characters who by " " normal " " standards could be considered deformed ( those micro-legs could never carry that giant body let alone make it jump ) so alive and lovable is more than " " just a highlight " " ! The creation of the world is another masterpiece . Not so much because of its looks but because of the inventiveness of it . The world our heroes travel is not solid like our own but is made of many pieces of land varying in shape and size that seem to be floating in mid air . When a person steps on a smaller fragment of ground , it nods a little bit as if feathering from the weight . In some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a foothold somewhere . Although the world of floating islands is completely surreal , in this movie it is absolutely believable and after a short time it doesn 't seem any weirder than running into a car somewhere in New York.I wrote that the looks of the world aren 't as breathtaking as the idea . As true as that might be to my mind , the quality of the world , the characters and the attention to details is staggering . Although the faces of the characters have relatively few attributes , emotions can be read as clearly as in Sean Connery 's or Dustin Hoffman 's face . The world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike . The background is always in motion , something is always going on which makes the world seem even more alive . If you stop the movie and look at the background you will be surprised how many details you can find.The existence of Hector actually puts the cherry on top . Hector is a furry little " " thing " " ( possibly the equivalent of a dog in our world ) who is totally lovable and extremely funny . Although he isn 't really important for the main plot , he would be missed like Scrat would be in Ice Age . The really cool thing about Hector is that you need to speak Gibberish to understand him.If the movie is so great , why didn 't I give it 10 stars ? Well , the plot in itself was rather thin . Two hunters are sent out to rescue the world from a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world , isn 't really original . That in itself wouldn 't be much of a problem . What I missed was the background information . What kind of a dragon was this and why did it look that way ? I love mythical stories but if they get too thin then they seem to be written after the movie is finished in a feeble attempt to give the whole thing some depth.Another thing I didn 't like was Zo챕 . Although a little girl like her could be considered adorable , she was somewhat of a pain in this movie . She seemed pretty resistant to all types of learning about reality , kept dreaming of some hero from a story book and basically slowed the others down . She would have been OK if she had developed a little more and a little earlier in the movie - or had been less of a girly to start with . To me the idea of this girl who was there to twist the story a little backfired on the writers.All in all , this is a really good movie for just about all ages . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired ! ) and agree with many of the comments , that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on . Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied , so off I went to discover more . I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story . The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film , is ' real ' and down to earth . I hope you enjoy it . I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy . She is a singer ( aswell as dancer ) in her own right and I think this was the edge needed to create the character . Some other actresses may have struggled with this . It is ashame the film did not delve deeper into her story . After all this is the film title , but I felt we learnt more about Richard , but I suppose like any performer worth their salt , you should always leave them wanting more ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy , but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s . There 's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being . Valentine ( Irene Jacob ) lives in Geneva , where she works as a model . Though she has a boyfriend , she seems to be rather lonely . One night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner , a retired jugde ( Jean-Louis Trintignant ) , who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls . Disgusted by him she cannot go away and they meet again . Two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other . The story itself is too complex to be told completely , there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and Valentines real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendship.The actors are wonderful , Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship . The topics are of an endless validity , Fraternity , not only in contact with each other , but also in the respect for the right of privacy . Alarmingly we seem to loose this right more and more , which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994.Red is one of the strongest colours that exists , representing inner turmoil , love , anger and passion . Used here as another protagonist , it brings a unmatched depth to the movie . A masterpiece ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The 100 black and white half-hour episodes of the early situation comedy " " Mr. Peepers " " were originally broadcast from 1952-55 on NBC . Like a lot of baby boomers this and " " Ding Dong School " " are my earliest memories of television . Since both ran later in syndication it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts . " " Mr. Peepers " " is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value . It represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like " " The Honeymooners " " and " " I Love Lucy " . " The genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the loud abrasive path of those two shows ; which is probably why they still seem contemporary . " " Mr. Peepers " , " which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained tone , may appear slow and dull in comparison . But it 's really more a matter of adjusting to the different style . Once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers . Credit should be give to the show 's producer , Fred Coe , a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out ( " " Philco Television Playhouse " , " " " Lights Out " , " " " Playhouse 90 " , " " " Producers Showcase " , " " " Playwrights 56 " , " " " Fireside Theatre " , " etc . ) even on kinescope . " " Mr. Peepers " " offered a much more gentle style with Wally Cox ( to be the voice of " " Underdog " " a few years later ) in the title role , Robinson Peepers , a mild-mannered high school science teacher . His glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer . The series provided Cox with an outstanding supporting cast . Tony Randall played his brash best friend , history teacher Harvey Weskit . Jack Warden played Frank Whip , the loud gym teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflict elements . There is some love interest competition involving the school 's nurse , Nancy Remington ( Patricia Benoit ) , with viewers quickly aligning with Mr. Peepers who seems a much better match for the gentle Nancy . Their on-screen marriage near the end 1953-54 season captured national attention , an early version of the " " Who Shot J.R. ? " " frenzy.Then again , what do I know ?

" This is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in , effected by , or suffering from an eating disorder . It is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl , its causes and its symptoms . The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today , Alison Lohman , who was later so spectacular in ' Where the Truth Lies ' . I would recommend that this film be shown in all schools , as you will never see a better on this subject . Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding , and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder . If barometers tell us the air pressure , Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy . Her emotional range is so precise , each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradations of trauma , on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity . Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother , and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as Lohman 's . Together , they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another . This film is really an astonishing achievement , and director Katt Shea should be proud of it . The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people . But even if you like nature films best , this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge . Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair . And if we don 't sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair , then we are dead inside . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I agree with so many of the other reviewers here . This was a great film and an even better novel by Robert Fish . Unfortunately , I believe the author died before he could see this film made . The performances are all top rate , with the three principles ( John Glover , Ben Cross , and Veronica Hamel ) seemingly made for their roles . The exteriors , both in Europe and Israel , seem very authentic , and the 4-hour miniseries length was just right for the telling of this story . Fortunately , I DID tape this when it was on television and have enjoyed watching it ever since . I can say unhesitatingly that it holds up even to this day . I gave it a rating of 10 .

Thank God there wasn 't a cameo from Will Ferrell ( love him , but saw him too much this summer ) .There were parts of comedic genius in this movie . Partly thanks to Carrell , and partly thanks to the writing ( also Carrell ) .

" Not since The Simpsons made it 's debut has there been a sitcom that I didn 't want to turn of in a matter of 2 minutes . It has of course been said that The Simpsons killed the sitcom . Not this one though.The first season was so so as the teenage characters were not quite as outrageous as they later became . They even went to school sometimes . The following seasons the character where fledged out . Eric , the sarcastic twit , Donna , his levelheaded girlfriend , Kelso , the dim bulb , Hyde , the conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk , Fez , the pervert exchange student and finally Jackie , the spoiled rich floozy . As for the adult characters there was Eric 's mom , the " " can you believe she is so ditzy " " suburban mom , Eric 's dad , the straight arrow who of course wasn 't such a hard ass as he seemed , Donna 's goofy dad and her dumb blonde mom . Everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to Kurtwood Smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his Red Forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness.Topher Grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good . It 's a tough character to play because it doesn 't allow the actor to indulge in wild overacting like the Kelso character , played competently by Ashton Kutcher . I enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different.Hyde 's character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time , although I will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons.Jackie , played by Family Guy voice artist Mila Kunis is hilarious and she has a nails on a chalkboard type voice , which actually fits her character . The only sad part is that we didn 't see more scenes with her and Eric because they were f ...... hilarious together . Too much story was wasted on her relationship problems since we already got that in spades with Eric and Donna.Last I will say that the casting of guest actors were always great . A few favorites : Fez ' humongous girlfriend in the mid-seasons , Pastor Dan , the totally awesome Leo played by the equally awesome Thomas Chong , another one of Fez ' girlfriends who is totally certifiable and a special appearance by the teenage witch Sabrina as a slutty catholic girl.Coming up next on Fox , whatever . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If this film strikes you ( as it did us and , apparently , others departing the theater ) as disappointingly thin , it may be because the subject herself is mildly disappointing . The film faithfully presents us Bettie Page as she probably was : a playful almost-innocent from the rural South whose career as " " the pinup queen of the universe " " was for her just goofy , natural fun . Her eventual moral qualms , religious conversion and sudden departure from nude and bondage modeling are biographically accurate , yet hard to understand given how untroubled she seemed by her livelihood.There are many reasons to see this film even so , not least of which are the amazing b & w noir cinematography of W. Mott Hopfel III ( complete with old fashioned wipes and dissolves ) , the 1950 's-faithful acting of the cast under the direction of Mary Harron , pitch-perfect performances by some of our most underrated supporting actors ( including Chris Bauer , Lili Taylor , Sarah Paulson , Austin Pendleton , Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak ) , not to mention the Oscar-worthy and technically difficult lead performance of Gretchen Mol.Ms. Mol does several scenes fully naked and most others in amazing period lingerie and " " specialty " " costumes ( gloriously assembled by costume designer John A. Dunn ) , yet she astonishingly maintains Bettie Page 's unstudied pleasure in her lush body . To watch Ms. Mol as Ms. Page , an aspiring actress , progressing through degrees of progressively less " " bad " " auditions and student acting scenes is to see a truly fine actress in complete control of her craft.The script does effectively bring us into 1950 's America , where childhood sexual abuse , lawless abduction and rape , and the legal suppression of brands of pornography which today seem laughably tame , is a reality . 50 's New York is evoked with seamlessly-inter cut news reel footage . 50 's Miami comes alive in super-saturated , 16mm-style color . The real Bettie Page seems to scamper , smile and pose before us , and yet the effect is curiously lightweight , barely lewd and not at all dangerous.How odd that bondage 's greatest icon should be so lacking in venom , and that this technically excellent biopic should have so little sting . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the only Christopher Guest movie that rivals Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for sheer entertainment value , but somehow never gets near the recognition . The plot surrounds the contestants--dogs--and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dog ... OK , it 's about a dog show . The owners truly are characters , as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs . That 's really all there is to it , but that makes it funny enough.You 'd never be able to convince me that a mock-u-mentary about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where Levy and O 'hara visit Larry Miller 's house on TV ... but that 's really all it takes to convert any doubters . Spinal Tap was non-stop hilarity , joke after joke whereas Best in Show was had a few more lulls ( and by that I mean say 3 minute at MOST where something riotously funny doesn 't happen ) , but the big laughs are even bigger.The casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in , uh movies in general Parker Posey does a fine job . In fact , her tirade directed at Ed Begley Jr. and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the film.What 's amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot , simple as it was , around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction . I guess there 's a freedom in having such a minimal plot . Everyone 's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely over-the-top . The realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman . I actually encounter wierdos like this now and then . If you like Guest 's stuff at all , you should definitely own this one . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" People call this a comedy , but when I just watched it , I laughedonly once . I guess the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14 , and I wasn 't old enough to understand that it wasn 't meant to betaken seriously . There were quite a few scenes that were meantto be funny , but I cared too much about the characters to laugh atthem.I suggest that you watch this film next time you 're falling in love , and try to take it seriously . I think you 'll find that , despite a few sillyflaws , it 's one of the most moving love stories you 've ever seen . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Maybe it wasn 't that good as a whole , but the second episode , which was the first one I say , was so memorable I still remember it today . I became a fan of Dick Francis . I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries.The cockney slang of the sidekick , Chico Barnes , is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing London 's Bow Bells , but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting.Sid Halley was one of Francis ' more interesting characters , and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand . Interestingly , electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after World War II . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This program is certainly my favorite non-sitcom television comedy . Australia produces very little good programs - most of the TV which I watch ( and I live in Australia ) is from the US and England.The funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is . Like when they went past numerous security barriers at the APEC summit pretending to be Canadian diplomats.The show is made up of pre-filmed stunts , general satirical discussion of current world events , and sometimes on-stage skits . These all come together to make a fabulous , extremely funny TV show . The segments like " " Ad Road-test " " and " " Message from Osama bin Ladin " " are hilarious . For anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical TV comedy - then this is definitely the show you should watch.All the guys are great and do an excellent job in entertaining you for half an hour.I would rate it 10 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In the eighties , Savage Steve Holland put out three movies , two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre , absurdist teen comedies . The third " " How I Got Into College " " does not measure up to " " Better Off Dead " " and this one , mainly because of it 's lack of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong ( Except for a tiny cameo ) .One Crazy Summer is an underrated movie , with lots of great characterizations and gags . As I recall , Savage Steve 's movies were vilified as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he drifted into children 's TV . We could use more movies from the likes of him . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the best film version of Dicken 's classic tale . I 've seen it over and over on VHS , and recently acquired the DVD version , which is formatted for TV ( not wide-screen ) . What I find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of English actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films / shows in North America since 1984 . My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward , " " the Equalizer " , " as the Ghost of Christmas Present . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating , because I wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds . As a matter of fact , they didn 't - at least , so its seems . Some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie - that 's it , this is what the majority of viewers think . However , the surprise comes at the end , and unfortunately then , when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie . I was also astonished when I saw that the Brazilian-Portuguese title of this movie means " " Voyage into Death " . " This is THE spoiler.That this movie is about a young girl who goes ALONE onto this boat ( on reasons that are completely unclear ) , you understand only in the last 5 minutes . When you start the movie with the English title " " Haunted Boat " " in your head , you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the " " ghosts " . " But in reality , this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer-watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality , it is told from the perspective of the young girl . We see her not alone , but together with the four friends because SHE sees them . We do not see that she is alone . So , the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture-stream , but the main story ! We have at least two parallel worlds : The world in which the girl is and the world in which the 4 friends are . An intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat.I cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie , the movie-makers " " cheated " " an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film-student elaborate with hastily " " chosen " " pseudo-actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers . How mistaken can one be ! But in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes , the end that follows gives another surprise . The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat . When she has recovered from her shock , she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends . And there they are again ! They wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore . She jumps into the water , arrives at the boat - and they are away . Miraculously beautiful . It remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a Rhetoromance writer : When I awoke , I saw Death standing at my bed . But I closed my eyes . When I opened them again - he was gone . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have to say that Higher Learning is one of the top 3 movies I have ever watched . It has a brilliant cast , and an equally brilliant director . Singleton shows how life in University can be . There are 3 main story lines , the skinheads , the African-Americans , and the homosexuals . I was intrigued by all of the stories , but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about Kristen , battling her feelings towards another girl . The end was great . After seeing the movie 25 times plus , I still cry . I would have given this movie an 11 , but I have to settlefor 10 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a modest , character driven comedy , filmed in Brazil on a low budget . The premise is familiar , the same as in the 1950 's Danny Kaye movie * * On the Double * * : someone who , as a joke , does an impression of a Famous Person then is dragooned to impersonate the Person for real.The contrast between the two leads is highly effective . Raul Julia as the German-Paradorian secret policeman , is tall , cool , menacing and Latin . He sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job . Richard Dreyfus , animated , short , New York Jewish , is funny and sympathetic . There are many references and inside jokes about show business.The setting is clearly modeled on Paraguay . Paraguay was indeed ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by Gen. Alfredo Stroessner , an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from Germany . But writer / director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin American tyranny , with huge disparities in wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency . Further in this vein , Mazursky casts comic Jonathan Winters as an American retiree who in truth is C.I.A. station chief in Parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a profanity-laced chewing out . In fact the U.S. has little influence in Paraguay , which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region . This is due to the country 's having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries . The male population was nearly wiped out both times but the society that emerged was patriotic , racially homogeneous and strongly united . On yet another level , there is a bow to feminism in the form of the character Madonna . Played by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga , Madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body-stockinged presidential pleasure girl at the film 's start but is seen on television as president herself at the end--now politically and cosmetically correct , no makeup , hair demurely pulled back , swept to office by a velvet revolution.The one time that such an event actually happened in Latin America , the administration of Argentina 's Isabel Peron ( not the beloved Evita , who never held office ) lasted two years after the death of her husband , legendary * * supremo * * Juan Peron . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I have seen her grow over the years . The minute I saw her interact with Oprah , I predicted that this show would happen , because I saw how taken Oprah is with her , and with good reason : she comes across as very natural , and willing to laugh at herself , which is very engaging . The set is appealing , and there are some fresh ideas ( I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on ) . There 's just enough of a celebrity segment , and she stays away from controversy and debate ( there 's enough of that on daytime TV ) . The show is a lighthearted escape , and she hasn 't moved away from her strength ( cooking ) , which is very good planning . I know there are people who hate her and hate her show ; that 's OK , you can 't please everybody . And somehow , I think Rachael knows and accepts that . So just turn the channel ; I don 't think she 'd mind . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This almost documentary look at an enterprising boy who lives in the body shop area outside of New York is real all the way . Real lighting . Real sound . Less editing in the whole movie than in 1 minute of most movies . And while there is very little script , there is a story . Shot in primary colors , almost all red , white , blue and yellow , we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing . He has a place to live that he makes his own , has a good job , and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe . The people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which I didn 't know about . They mostly seem decent and pay Ale what seems like daily , seeming truly concerned about his well being . The actor ( I think ) playing Ale says more with one facial expression than one can imagine . This reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish . It shows what kids are capable of , even without much support and love . Definitely recommend . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling , dark , and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic ( Paxton himself ) who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders , claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but " " demons " , " and that they have been selected by God to destroy these " " demons " . " This is all told in flashback by one of the sons , now grown up ( Matthew McConaughey ) to skeptical FBI agent ( Powers Boothe ) .Hard to automatically forget this film ; better than most serial killer features , it 's a twisty and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks . Paxton , commendably , barely shows any blood at all until near the end . Well acted by all , especially the two child actors ( Jeremy Sumpter of the recent " " Peter Pan " " and Matt O 'Leary of " " Spy Kids 2 " " and " " Domestic Disturbance " " ) . The only reason I deducted any points at all is because I can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach . In any event , it 's an atypical thriller with a decent script.8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn 't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it ( Which btw , mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about . ) , I thought it sounded interesting , and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film . " " What controversy ? " " I thought to myself as I put the tape in the player , I was curious I get . And my expectations were certainly met . I loved it ! I guess it is a really girly kind of movie , but it was so sweet and adorable ! It was a beautiful romance , although at times the directing reminded me of the camera work in ' The Graduate ' , which I thought at the time of seeing it the director must have been on acid with some of the close ups they did.OK , so it wasn 't entirely conceivable for these two kids to run off and live on their own ... but it could happen ... in a fantasy ... But , the ending just sincerely ticked me off ! I was so mad with how they ended it ... it sort of leaves you hanging , and I suppose they may address what actually happens to them in the sequel ... but at the same time , I 'm almost hesitant to see that , since sequels are almost never as good as the first.I totally recommend this movie to anyone sixteen and over ! It 's an awesome movie ... Awesome ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" PAGE 3 * * * * out of 4 StarsMadhvi ( Konkona Sen ) enters her boyfriend 's house and its empty . She looks here and there and then goes in his bedroom and you get the picture - ' Ah ! another girl 혚 that two-timing baddie and yes indeed he his two timing her but it 's a GUY this time around . And i say ' Brilliant ! ' END OF SPOILERS ( The above scene is not a spoiler really ... but for me it was so i didn 't want to take a chance ) When asked upon as how was this film , my friend answered ' oh , it just an expos챕 of the P3 people ' which made me believe that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more . When I went to the theater , I thought to myself " I better get a pen and a paper to jot down the bad things about this film " but I was proved entirely wrong혚 and then some because I could muster only the goods . This film was great . Great , not because it is offbeat and noncommercial cinema like storyline but because of the cleverness in the screenplay and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly which could have been a dumb and senseless movie if given in the wrong hands.Konkona Sen Sharma is grace . She is so damn beautiful who has nailed her role perfectly as if she was born to play this part . One of the most charming actresses I 've ever seen . But this is not the only performance which is good in the film , there 's Sandhya Mridul , Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni . Particularly Sandhya Mridul who just fires up the screen . ( And guess what even the unusually accented Tara Sharma speaks normally ) The movies stars off with some silly old parties of the hush-hush celebrities of the film industry et al and you get the idea of what this movie will be about . And for about half hour through the film you feel just about the same . But then the movie picks up the pace grabs onto a good storyline and never lets go of it . Even Boman Irani agrees to that statement 혯 ' It was a good story , Madhvi ' . ( Thank you ) . The great thing is that it tackles the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not make it over done and also tackles the social issues and does not make them boring . In the end its all a roller-coaster ride and Madhvi informs us that by just smiling at all these people . Just the reason why I love watching films . Ecstatic film-making . The screenplay is beautiful , clever and witty . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre . I was happy to see William Powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm , and without the silly attitude of his Nick Charles character ( from the " " Thin Man " " series ) . While the story is good on its own , I think what really makes this movie fun to watch is Michael Curtiz ' fantastically imaginative direction . From a visual point of view , this is a richly textured movie , with Curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium ; from split screen images , to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks , Curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best Hollywood directors . Highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I know a lot of people have said don 't bother with this movie because its not a good fighting flick and hard with the subtitles . That is a really lazy way to think of a movie . If you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else , and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art , this being a masterful piece of work . If you want to watch this , its not about the fighting really . There are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work , but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part . This is not the basic Kung-fu movie . The story is really the central focus and not the fights , and the combination of the two make an excellent movie thats well worth watching , and is even better in the original language with subtitles . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Back in 2004 I saw " " True " , " Tom Tykwer 's contribution to Paris Je T 'aime . When I saw it I loved it and became thrilled . It became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much . Of course I wanted to watch the whole film , and I would even check who was attached , etc.Yesterday I finally saw it , courtesy of the internet.First of all I must say that it looks AWESOME . The photography is BEAUTIFUL in every short and shot , at the worst being nothing special - but still brilliant and clear . Later I read the trivia here , and maybe it 's how scanning in 6K gives more justice to all the DP 's work . My special favorites are the " " Quais de Seine " " first scene ( that sunlight ! ) , the Sin City-esquire ( but better for me ) " " Quartier de la Madeleine " , " and " " 14th Arrondisement " " - but you know , what the hell I like them all : " " True " " or " " Faubourg Saint-Denis " " still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours ( my eyes , they tremble ! ) and " " Quartier Latin " " is gold imprisoned on silver . Beautiful.Yes , these are some BEAUTIFUL short films.Now let 's get onto the content . I very much ( and I mean VERY MUCH ) like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt . You never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts , and I think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts . I loved coming from a simple love story into a crazy-Chinese-musical-in-Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue . I love surprises ! And this film has them ! It 's great they took a chance to let all these director 's flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema ( which I have come to heavily despise ) . It 's not heavily experimental , but I can breath the breathing space these people had.I like the small time and I love the acting . I love the simplicity and I love the love . I like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it 's a film that is very very very nice to see , alone or with someone . To simply feel . It left me feeling very good.There is something about the earnestness in it ... it 's so frank ... What I didn 't like ? Well , for me there are two shorts that aren 't exactly the best - " " Quais de Seine " " ( which is good natured , sure , and maybe even necessary , but feels too much like a commercial ? ) and " " P챔re-Lachaise " " that even though I love the acting , I felt it 's themes were forced . But that of course , is just me . " " Tour Eiffel " " I also didn 't love but I think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of Sylvain Chomet ? I don 't know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actor 's and directors , and so they can delight in their interaction , in the surprises ( look out for Alexander Payne in a funny role ) and basically in " " what will this director do with this ? " " great question . I enjoyed it very much in that way.I repeat now : Most shorts I loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix . I definitely recommend it . Definitely ! ! ! So , watch it if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
There are few films that have had me waiting and waiting for release more than this one . This is the latest film from The Dead Gentlemen group responsible for the original Gamers film and the Demon Hunters films . This group has not been terribly active over the last few years but this film is a definite reason to try and keep things up in following their progress.This film follows a group of gamers who are trying to finish a campaign run by a GM frustrated by his group 's disregard for his story . With the help of some new blood they attempt the campaign again with hopes of finishing this time.This movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original . The movie shows respect for the game much like the original movie did but on top of that this movie shows a dramatic improvement on special effects launching it above the simplicity of college films . The acting is fairly decent and the jokes are quite funny.Unfortunately many of the jokes are in jokes so if you are not a gamer you may not find the film as funny as others . So this is why I give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that I initially thought of . Any case if you are a gamer or know about gaming check this one out you will enjoy it . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Alyson and Dave are trying to rebuild an old home and restore it to comfortable living conditions .

" Trick or Treat , Quickie Review This zany romp of a film revolves around the 80 's culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies--two things which I love dearly . So , as you can imagine , this movie appealed to me pretty easily . Plus , for no apparent reason , Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher.This film is about an unpopular high school youth who , like all us losers , ended up drenched in a world of " " evil " " Heavy Metal . His favorite Metaldude dies and , of course , is miraculously resurrected--by playing his latest unreleased album backwards . This allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and sh * t helping out.Okay , it 's pretty cheesy at times , but you know what ? It 's got a surprising number of good qualities . Decent acting ( including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ ) , pretty good special effects , very brief nudity , decent atmosphere ... All in all , it 's actually a decent horror film . But what really sucks is the music . Ironic , huh ? Well , this " " uber-evil " " Metal guy is one of the most obnoxious , high-pitched , wailing , Motley Crue rejects on the planet--and the " " Metal " " is little more than putrid 80 's Pop / Hair Metal . He hits all the clich챕 's here , from prancing around like a gay fairy , to looking mean , to screaming " " Rock and Roll ! ! ! " " in a pitch high enough to make King Diamond retch . Aside from that atrocious musical representation , it 's actually pretty good . 7 / 10www.ResidentHazard.com , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " Why did they make them so big ? Why didn 't they just give the money to the poor ? " " The question about cathedrals was asked by a student to Mr. Harvey during a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral . " " That 's a good question , " " he replied . " " Partly to inspire them - to get them to look up with awe . " " I 'm not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone , but this movie certainly had that impact on me . It was awesome ! It didn 't start out that way . For a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of - well - a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral . If you 've ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it . You have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day , the bus driver who 's driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control . Been there , done that , got the t-shirt was my initial reaction . I figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students . YAWN ! But it turns out to be so much more ! Timothy Spall was brilliant as Mr. Harvey - a sombre , unsmiling teacher with a strange fascination for cathedrals . Over the course of the movie , his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story . We also get introduced to some of the troubled students - most notably Helen , also brilliantly played by Nathalie Press , who 's into self-mutilation.This isn 't a religious movie , but it includes some powerful reflections on religious themes . When Harvey 's colleague Jonathon ( played by Ben Miles ) says " " I don 't care what anyone believes as long as they don 't try to force it on anyone else " " Harvey replies , " " that isn 't tolerance - it 's indifference ! " " - which is , in fact ( in my opinion ) what often passes for religious tolerance in our society . There are scenes of reconciliation between various characters , and the final scene of the movie was brilliant . As Harvey climbs back on the bus , director Susanna White has the camera slowly pan upwards , so that the final shot is simply of the sky - hearkening back to Harvey 's comment that the purpose of the cathedral is to get people to look up in awe . The cathedral accomplishes its goal . We look up into the universe in awe , seeking something greater than ourselves , however we choose to define it . This is a very powerful and very inspiring movie . 9 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" While visiting Romania with his CIA dad , Tony ( Adam Arkin ) , quite a talented high school quarterback seen as the savior to lead his team finally to a victory over rival Simpson , is told by a would-be palm-reader ( .. in Romania , the people are not allowed many books , so she took up palm reading ) that he would be bitten by a werewolf ( " " When the moon is full , don 't make any appointments .. you will be busy . " " ) . Well , who would have thunk it .. Tony is in fact bitten and his life would be forever changed . After his father unfortunately dies in a mishap within his bomb shelter ( ! ) under odd circumstances ( firing at his werewolf son inside a metallic bomb shelter isn 't a very good idea , especially if the bullet doesn 't leave the room and bounces around like a pinball gone berserk ) , Tony travels the land through endless years , until he 's tired of packing , and returns decades ( .. and many US Presidents ) later to hopefully lead his football team to a win over Simpson .. a task he abandoned long ago . What was once a very white , clean-cut high school has indeed changed into a ghetto of drug use , violence , and perversion . To get an idea of what the early 80 's Full Moon High school 's prom party resembles , think Studio 54 with teenagers .. Larry Cohen 's parody of werewolf flicks , among others things , is crammed full of gags , homages , and in-jokes . My favorite sequences contain one in the sex-ed classroom where Tony reveals to the 80 's class his werewolf transformation and the introductory scene to Dr. Brand ( Alan Arkin , who steals the film when Kenneth Mars isn 't on screen ) , quite possibly the worst psychiatrist on Earth . His task to talk down a jumper leads to two men falling off a balcony .. the jumper and a fireman ( trying , at first , to talk him out of it ) , both fuming mad at Brand ! Brand even tries to get Tony to sign a waver for his body 's being donated to science so he can get his wife a fur coat ! Kenneth Mars had me rolling in the floor as a homosexual football coach ( .. and later in the 80 's as the Principal ) who likes to pat his players on the behind .. his scene where Tony 's unloading the truth to the sex-ed class is classic . The film is loaded with inspired casting choices .. just littered with funny characters and the cast interpretations .. such as Ed McMahon as a very conservative military blowhard who actually looks identical to Joseph McCathy standing next to his photo in the bomb shelter ( .. always talking about commies ) , Joanne Nail as bulging eyed Ricky in present day who falls for the werewolf , Elizabeth Hartman ( A Patch of Blue ) as a mousy , nerdy sexually molested ( .. and molester ) teacher who finds an attraction towards Tony , James Dixon as a deputy ( .. his great scene has him stealing a line from his police chief reciting it to Dr. Brand who begins mouthing the words to himself for memorization ) , Roz Kelly as Jane , an undyingly devoted female desiring Tony for only herself constantly demanding he ravish her , and Bill Kirchenbauer as Flynn , Tony 's long-time pal and now the police chief who only got Jane after his friend left town . Can not forget JM J Bullock as Flynn 's closeted gay son trying to fit in at the school hoping to find a dame with hilarious results.I like how the film pays homage to the werewolf genre such as when he 's on the prowl .. he 's often referred to in the papers as Jack the Nipper because he likes to bite his victims on the cheek .. and I 'm not talking face . He 's seen more as an annoyance than danger . The homages to Carrie and Psycho are nice , and the violin shtick is also amusing . Cohen tosses so many zingers at the viewer , eventually one has to stick . Obviously in a comedy such as this , not every joke hits it 's mark , but many do . The cast makes this worthwhile . The film looks cheap on the typical Larry Cohen budget . Notice the 50 's scenes where the obvious old cast members that would show up down the road wear glaring wigs . Loved Adam in the lead .. he is the perfect foil for the gags that follow him and the zingers he lets fly from Cohen 's script . The film moves quickly , rarely catching a breath . I liked this horror comedy more than most it seems . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) . I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good . Lately though it 's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me . First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net , that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube , that are generally funny , or of people getting hurt inadvertently ( some intentionally ) . Umm , this when watched 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same stuff , I really haven 't seen anything that good and I can only laugh at people actually probably breaking their necks and being paralyzed so many times . The show is like a Late Show wanna be / Colbert Report wanna be with it 's politics also , if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal , this humor gets old also , McCain is old , yeah yeah , whatever . Libs have no guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that would endear themselves as having a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves , so it 's almost every show bash McCain or Palin , sheesh . So we get the same old vids of people getting hurt that we are supposed to keep laughing at and then some leftist political humor that never laugh 's at itself out of it 's own weakness . I 'll keep watching since I watch at work and it 's all that 's on , hoping that I 'll be entertained but it is getting somewhat old . I did like the fill in host 's of Chris and Alison though , they were actually a good change of pace ; maybe this show could do a rotating host thing . Olivia who I thought at times in the beginning was really funny has resorted to this constant pouting response and it 's getting old , lol . 7 of 10 ; it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you 're a younger Baby Boomer like me ( mid 40 's ) . Maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do , there is a ton of stuff available they could use . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Brotherhood of Satan " " is one of the most underrated horror films of all times.Why it hasn 't achieved a cult status is beyond me.This is a chilling tale of terror and witchcraft which contains one of the most powerful and disturbing climaxes in the annals of screen horror.In the small American town some children have disappeared and their parents been violently murdered.What is the cause of hysteria ? The film is really eerie , some scenes are genuinely unnerving and definitely not easily forgotten.The suspense never lets up , the acting is really good , and the climax is bizarre and disturbing.Check out this forgotten gem of satanic horror.Absolutely recommended . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to love the whole world , but given that a human heart is very small in size , every human has that special place that he loves more than any other . It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors . The result is a wonderful collection of short films , Paris je t 'aime , in which our guides , Van Sant , Coixet , Cuaron , Payne and others take us on a breathtaking stroll through Parisian arrondissements , human feelings , yearnings and expectations.Always some other quarter , always some utterly moving story about ordinary people in search for love , be it in a parking lot , art studio , tube station . And Paris je t 'aime is about vast array of loves- love for one 's partner , child , parent , for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around , love that needs rekindling , serendipitous love for that stranger as your eyes meet , or love that just is not meant to be ... today , but tomorrow- who knows ? Nevertheless , this film is not solely about love , but life itself , joy , pain , loneliness , confusion , everyday ups and downs . And its most important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all , but rather warm and full of hope.I give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop , but not all of them and that is the thing that I find missing , and by " " further development " " I do not mean some specific reference to the characters ' future . As far as everything else is concerned I can only say- captivating . Makes you want to leave everything behind you , flee to Paris and live those little romances yourself . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I went into " " The Closer She Gets " " knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker 's mother fighting cancer . I expected it to be a very harrowing , depressing movie . And although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching , the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends . It shows a family 's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together . They refuse to lose faith in each other , even in the darkest moments . The most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed . Little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her ( and their ) will to survive , and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness . In this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film . We should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality ... and to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as drama .... but I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years . Immensely sympathetic performance from Jared Harriss ( who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma ... hopefully without poor Richards penchant for hellraising and haminess ) .... and charming offbeat cuteness from costar Yu Xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer . Radiant location photography ( including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall ) and sensitive direction by Ann Hu give film added impact . In short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to life ... and making magic in the dark . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" From the beginning of the film I found myself laughing trying to keep quiet so I did not wake anyone in the house , this didn 't continue so much throughout the rest of the film , I didn 't find everything completely " " laugh out loud " " funny , but still I found certain things quite funny . At the beginning I had to hold in laughter when he drops the very crafty looking Hand Grenade down his sleeve . Then there are scenes where you will just smile , like when the Barber falls through a roof into someones apartment , I can see that being quite funny but in todays days and time that has been done quite a lot it didn 't feel original , though at the time , I 'm sure it was . I loved Hynkels ( Hitlers ) bursts of raging German with the nice subtle English translation.The final scene is wildly discussed because , well it 's absolutely true , and so very intelligently constructed . Though the film is sixty eight years old the final scene is still relevant today , if this doesn 't show how great a writer Chaplin is , then I don 't know what will . The acting in this scene in particular was quite good , the Barber transcended the message perfectly and makes you realise the serious nature of the film , at the same time enjoying the humorous side.Another element about this film is the fact that this was such a brave film , that almost feels ahead of it 's time . Of course , Chaplin did not know what was going to happen after 1940 , he was not aware of the Holocaust ( obviously ) , he 's also gone on record as to saying if he had of known he would not of made this film . The fact this film is so anti-Hitler is interesting , it 's more interesting that it wasn 't anti-Germany which would be very easy to have done back in those times , Chaplin could of easily made this a propaganda film , but instead did something more , he made an honest film.I recommend anyone remotely interested in this film to see it , as well those who has studied or is studying Hitler and WWII to watch this film . It 's entertaining to say the least , it doesn 't have an annoying out-dated feel that some films of the time did . Unlike most " " comedies " " this film actually has a message it tries to bring to you , watch this film , you will be better off for having seen it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film launched my theory about films based on books : Instead of following the cliche " " You 've read the book ; now see the film , " " if you are looking for a good book to read , try one upon which a movie you like was based , because it 'll be 10 times better.I saw this film on its initial release at the National Theater in downtown Eugene and liked it so much that I stayed to see it again . It 's a perfect merger of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors , Jon Voight , with what became my favorite book , " " The Water Is Wide , " " by Pat Conroy.I can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life . Two tiny caveats : ( 1 ) The video suffers severely from pan-and-scan and deserves a letterbox version . ( 2 ) The title should be restored to the name of the book , a reference to one of the most touching , enigmatic songs ever written , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond it 's initial liftoff . Based on a true story , one of the many " " small " " stories prior to WW II , that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures , impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes , with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon . Viewed at the Stony Brook Film festival , the film was enthusiastically received . Well written and expertly cast . The characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn 't always win out over imagination . We all know that killers like Freddy , Jason , Michael and even Leatherface shouldn 't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day . Most of us don 't believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains . And let 's hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like Funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them . This is where imagination wins out over fact . Horror , and most films in general , requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow . This usually isn 't a problem when I watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at George C. Scott or when I see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near Burketsville . But what I do have a problem digesting ( without wanting to regurgitate ) is when a film has a killer like the one in this film . To give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself , but just suffice to say that I actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed . There are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is . But the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done , suspenseful , blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by John Hough . If the film would have offered me a different killer , then I would actually be raving about it . This may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film , but believe me , anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me.John Cassevetes plays Dr. Sam Cordell . He and his daughter Jenny ( played beautifully by Erin Flannery ) have just recently moved to this small New England town . Cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died . We see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman ( one can only presume it is his wife ) is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour . Her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed . Again , I am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway . Cassevetes , it has to be mentioned , is strange to say the least . Cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental . There are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities . It never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent , but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug . Thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy . Casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor John Leslie and screen great James Caan . He has a deceptive smile and a virile , commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice . But he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene . He just has that slimy , disingenuous , phlegmatic , uneasy way about him . He never really looks like he can be trusted in this film . I guess that is a credit to the writers , the director and to Cassevetes himself . There was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get-go . The story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry . There is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see , something or someone is watching them . When the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck , the young woman wanders into the shed , just to play a prank . Once she is there , she is attacked . The young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail . Hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in . He looks frantically scours the room and spots his would-be lover bleeding in the corner , and then smacko , the guy gets it . It is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note.Also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named Tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces . Tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place , he has another dream . Toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother , a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of Galen.Throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time , the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped . This is my first feeble ( and careful ) attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement . It just didn 't strike the right chord.The Incubus is a well done film . It is tense , tight and even most of the performances are very well done . I was intrigued by the dreams that Tim was having and I was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders . But when you get through all that was good in the film , you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth . And bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones . 7 out of 10-- This could have been a nine . Too bad . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Rob Estes , Josie Bisset and a crap load of kids that look nothing like either of them.Basically , Rob and Josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during a Vegas vacation . They each come home to find that their respective children already know of the nuptials due to tabloid-like not-so-fodder . They , Rob and Josie , move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other 's house.Rob builds furniture , I think , which is close enough to Frank Lambert 's ( Patrick Duffy ) construction job on the much similar Step by Step to warrant eternal mockage.Josie is some sort of cookie-making queen , though it doesn 't look like she makes any of the cookies . Not close enough to Carol Foster 's ( Suzanne Somers ) hairdressing job to warrant likeness mockage , but hilariously preposterous enough to warrant atrocity mockage.Unlike Step by Step , they were a couple before the vacation and actually knew one another 's last names , or so one assumes if their serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together.Anyhow , there are eight kids ; Moira , Sandy , Jeff , Lily , Daisy , Nathan , Andrew L. and Andrew B. I , personally , think they should 've just called the younger Andrew ' Andy ' .There 's a lot of product placement , particularly for Soup at Hand ( Which is disgusting ) and Listerine Pocket Packs .

" I originally saw this film years ago during Cinemax Friday after dark series ( back when the cable box was built like a keyboard ) , and it intrigued me . Even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted.The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very enjoyable.They have a good chemistry together & Miou-Miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking.A movie like this probably wouldn 't be made in these politically correct times ( at least not in the US ) , since it seems to sensationalize things like violence , robbery , & casual sex . This movie proves that with a talented cast & also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject.It saddened me to find out Patrick Dewaere committed suicide & in the near future I , ll will check him out with Depardieu & Miou-Miou in Get Out Your Hankerchief . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What an extraordinary crime thriller ! ! My wife and I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival . It 's already my second favourite film of all-time after DR. STRANGELOVE and I was definitely on an emotional high as I walked home and discussed the film with my wife.I don 't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions . A synopsis that I 'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers , played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke , are planning to rob a jewellery store in Westchester , New York . The film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time ( before , during and after the robbery ) , and one key scene is repeated at least three times . Ordinarily , that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece . The excitement , the tension , and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed . By the end , I was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up . I know that I 've used a few clich챕s in this post , but I literally was on the edge of my seat . I should mention that the non-linear storyline is quite easy to follow . This isn 't the sort of movie where you 'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie.The acting is absolutely brilliant all-around , and I doubt I would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadn 't been so perfect . A tiny complaint is that Hoffman and Hawke don 't look like brothers , but that 's a minor quibble that I can easily overlook . Hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric . Marisa Tomei ( as Hoffman 's wife ) and Albert Finney ( as the father of Hoffman & Hawke ) are also very good in supporting roles . Even some cameo performances were so impressive that I can still remember every remark , gesture and facial expression by Brian O 'Byrne and Michael Shannon 혯 absolute perfection . The robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene I 've ever watched , and I had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes , especially the ones with Hoffman . The music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie , often the same notes played over very effectively . I had the music playing in my head the following day , even as I sat through other films . In addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph , there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable ( major spoiler , so I can 't describe the scene ) . Otherwise , this film is pretty darn close to perfect.There were about a dozen great films at the festival that I would enjoy watching a second time but BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU 'RE DEAD stands in a league of its own . As an aside , the director Sidney Lumet spoke before the film and he introduced Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawke onto the stage . Tomei didn 't speak and she acted a bit shy so Lumet asked " " Can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera-shy ? " " That comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The energetic young producer of theatrical prologues ( those staged performances , usually musical , that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days ) must deal with crooked competition , fraudulent partners , unfaithful lovers & amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the FOOTLIGHT PARADE.While closely resembling other Warner 's musical spectaculars , notably the GOLDDIGGER films , this movie had a special attraction none of the others had : Jimmy Cagney . He is a wonder , loose-jointed and lithe , as agile as any tomcat - a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie . Cagney grabs the viewers attention & never lets go , powering the rapid-fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma & buoyant charm.The rest of the cast gives their best , as well . Joan Blondell is perfect as the smart-mouthed , big-hearted blonde secretary , infatuated with Cagney ( major quibble - why wasn 't she given a musical number ? ) . Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler once again play lovers onstage & off ; the fact that her singing & acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing ; Powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead.Guy Kibbee & Hugh Herbert are lots of fun as brothers-in-law , both scheming to cheat Cagney in different ways . Ruth Donnelly scores as Kibbee 's wealthy wife , a woman devoted to her handsome prot챕g챕s . Frank McHugh 's harried choreographer is an apt foil for Cagney 's wit . Herman Bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger . Mavens will spot little Billy Barty , Jimmy Conlin & maybe even John Garfield during the musical numbers.Finally , there 's Busby Berkeley , choreographer nonpareil . His terpsichorean confections , sprinkled throughout the decade of the 1930 's , were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that Depression audiences wanted to enjoy . The big joke about Berkeley 's creations , of course , was that they were meant , as part of the plot , to be stage productions . But no theater could ever hold these products of the master 's imagination . They are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera.Berkeley 's musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches , either a story ( often rather bizarre ) told with song & dance ; or else stunning geometrically designed numbers , eye candy , featuring plentiful chorus girls , overhead camerawork & a romantic tune . In a spasm of outr챕 extravagance , FOOTLIGHT PARADE climaxes with three Berkeley masterworks : ' Honeymoon Hotel ' and its pre-Production Code telling of a couple 's wedding night ; ' By A Waterfall ' - dozens of unclad females , splashing , floating & diving in perfect patterns & designs ( peer closely & you 'll see how the synchronous effects were achieved ) ; and finally , ' Shanghai Lil ' - a fitting tribute to the talents of both Cagney & Berkeley . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Otto Preminger 's " " The Man with the Golden Arm " " is a reference to heroin addiction - something that must have been rather risky to film back in 1955 , fifty years ago ( the censors today STILL have a problem with drug content in films ! ) .The lead role was originally offered to Marlon Brando , then snatched by Frank Sinatra before Brando could respond . Sinatra convincingly portrays a pro card dealer and ex-heroin addict who returns home to the city only to find himself battling the demons of temptation.Preminger is one of my favorite directors ( his " " Anatomy of a Murder " " starring James Stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary courtroom drama ) . Preminger pretty much helped change the face of cinema back in the ' 50s - " " Anatomy of a Murder " " was extremely controversial when it came out due to both its plot and content ( references to rape , women 's " " panties , " " seduction , etc . ) and " " The Man with the Golden Arm " " deals with a topic that is equally volatile.However , Preminger pulls it off without becoming exploitative . This is like a forerunner to " " The Panic in Needle Park " " ( 1971 ) and bears more than a few similarities in terms of general motifs to the classic Billy Wilder movie " " Lost Weekend , " " starring Ray Milland . These three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism predating the 1980s and still remain relevant today . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Toby Malone 's performance really stood out , I found myself actually caring about what happens to Matt throughout the whole of the film , which itself is a lot of fun , very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters , quite an achievement considering it 's short running time . There are plenty of good twists throughout as well , it will keep you guessing until the end . Other characters to watch out for are the totally insane Tiny and the sneaky attractive Jesse . It may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster but don 't let that put you off , you could do a lot worse than checking this out , you won 't regret it .

" It 's a generic coming-of-age story -- think " " The Member of the Wedding , " " " " Summer of ' 42 , " " " " A Summer Place , " " even " " Little Women " " -- and there are moments where Mulligan might have omitted the soupy music , not used slow-motion , or played down the golden-lit prettiness of the setting . Otherwise , it 's done with rare emotional perfect-pitch . Nothing 's forced , every line has feeling , and the pacing is just right . Even the below-A-list casting helps : Bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material . In particular , Witherspoon is excellent : Her line readings are fresh and original , and her body language is just right for a gawky , hoydenish 14-year-old on the eve of womanhood . Waterston is also very fine , even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck.One senses that the film 's makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects -- no big stars , no big car crashes , no special effects -- and consciously decided to make the best possible movie , box office be damned . It 's intimate and honest , and it sticks to the ribs . If you find yourself misting up at the end , you don 't have to feel you 've been duped . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The power to dream is a wonderful thing . There 's a saying , " " Not all dreamers achieve , but all achievers dream . " " By exploring our imagination we shape our own futures . Or build empires . Perhaps overcome our fears , limitations and obstacles . Gain wisdom and benefit mankind . Or ( put simply ) just find our way to true love and happiness . Freud might express such things in symbols . The language of fantasy.Tristan ventures out of a rather twee English village called Wall . He goes through a break in the wall . A portal . In search of something that will prove his love to Victoria ( Sienna Miller ) . Victoria doesn 't take him very seriously . So he pledges to bring back a falling star.Stormhold is the world outside the wall . He discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl , Yvaine ( Claire Danes ) . To complicate matters , three evil witches want to get hold of Yvaine . If they can eat her heart , it will replenish their youth . ( One of the witches is played by Michelle Pfeiffer , who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner . ) The ' good guy ' they meet on their way is Captain Shakespeare ( Robert de Niro ) . He has a fierce , swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath . Heirs of Stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the Kingdom . Ricky Gervais is an added extras . A buffoon trader throwing in standard Gervais-type gags well . Tristan 's purity of spirit arouses the love of Yvaine , so there is a nice little triangle going . Till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women.Stardust is a full-on , large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars . Wholly positive , and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of Harry Potter romps . Production values rival Hollywood , and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping , misogyny , religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies.That is not to say that Stardust is without its faults . Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements , and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences . But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly , this film may well provide it.As a boy , I remember listening in wonder to albums by the Moody Blues ( who practiced in a house not far from where I lived ) . They made records with names like " " In Search of the Lost Chord , " " and wrote lyrics like , " " Thinking is the best way to travel . " " I would fill my head with books on magic and mystery , from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley . Shaping dreams . Learning to make them real . Nowadays people might talk of NLP or positive thinking . Adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity . Do you still enjoy that feeling ? You are advised not to wait for Stardust on DVD . See it on the biggest cinema screen you can find . And Dolby Digital Surround Sound if you can get it . The actors look like they had a ball . Maybe you will too . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible ' guilty ' laughing.Every viewer seemed to recognise the bad side of their self in one of the characters or at least a side of their self they wish they had . Actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in Greek audience 's heart.My personal favourites ( apart the first two i mentioned ) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos , Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis but so many amazing actors passed by some episodes from time to time . Whoever around the world understands Greek should find a way to watch this series , even though it 's been more than 5 years that it was on TV.In Greece they keep repeating the series ( ANT1 ) in every chance there is like summertime or early afternoon zones.We 'll never forget Eglimata or any of the casting crew ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " D척 desu ka den " " is the first colored movie of Master Akira Kurosawa , and surprisingly is not about samurais , ronins , warlords or battlefields . It is inside a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo , where the dwellers are homeless drunkards , beggars , tramps , abused women , losers . I do not know the reason why Kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors , but indeed they are very sad stories , some of them heart-breaking . I personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them ; the story of the retarded boy that believes he pilots a train ; the story of the man that raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters ; and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather .

" The original movie , The Odd Couple , has some wonderful comic one-liners . The entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat-freak Felix Ungar and funny , obnoxious , slob Oscar Madison . This paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful TV series of all time as well as countless , not anywhere near as good , imitations.The Odd Couple movie has some wonderful jokes about Oscar 's apartment and his sloppy habits . He says , " " Who wants food ? " " One of his poker player buddies asks , " " What do ya got ? " " Oscar says , " " I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches . " " " " What 's the brown ? " " It 's either very new cheese or very old meat ! " " I also love the line about Oscar 's refrigerator , " " It 's been out of order for two weeks , I saw milk standing in there that wasn 't even in a bottle ! " " There is no question that Walter Matthau 's Oscar Madison is a joy to watch on screen . He 's almost as good as Jack Klugman 's version in the TV series.The problem with the movie is Jack Lemmon 's Felix Ungar . Jack makes a very , very , honest effort at the role . The problem is that he makes Felix SO depressing and down-trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical . Tony Randall 's performance in the series , brought the kind of humor , warmth , and sensitivity , to Felix 's character , which Lemmon 's portrayal lacks . Tony 's Felix Unger obviously could be annoying some of the time . However , in the TV series , it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline . Jack 's Felix Ungar , ( note the different spelling ) in the movie , seems to never be happy , fun , or interesting . The movie Felix Ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall , all the time.The movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time , the " " famous " " meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever ! One of the other great examples of Felix 's " " little notes " " on Oscar 's pillow will be remembered forever . However , there are some darker sides where Oscar goes over the top , His " " crying " " near the end after bawling out Felix , and a scene involving Felix 's Linguine dinner , ( although lightened by a funny line . ) seem more depressing than comical.Perhaps there wasn 't enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie . The beginning 20 minutes are very boring . The same issue occurs with Felix 's conversation with the Pidgeon Sisters . The movie 's ending is predictable and too pat . There 's very little care or compassion for each of them by the other . The result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger , rather than comedy , unless you are watching the great scenes described above . It appears that Jack Lemmon 's monotone persona of Felix brings the film down , rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters.It really took the 1970 's TV series to make The Odd Couple the best that it could be . The original film is still very good . However , the TV series is much better . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just witnessed a movie that by all rights should have been fodder for a second rate MOW on Lifetime ... but trust the Irish to keep it from being anything but saccharine .

" A well cast summary of a real event ! Well , actually , I wasn 't there , but I think this is how it may have been like . I think there are two typically American standpoints evident in the film : ' communistophobia ' and parallels to Adolf Hitler . These should be evident to most independent observers . Anyway , Boothe does a great performance , and so do lots of other well-known actors . The last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable - and I mean it !

" Gus Van Sant has made some excellent films . I truly am a fan.However , I can 't help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins book " " Even Cowgirls Get the Blues " " is lost in translation to the big screen . Alone , Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent . Ultimately though this one just didn 't work . It wasn 't that the characters weren 't well developed or the plot and content didn 't come alive . It 's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this . We 're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and / or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author 's precision . Movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience . This is what I believe happened here.I suggest reading the book ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Jennifer Grey seems the unlikeliest of romantic leads and that 's probably the reason why this beloved film is such a sure-fire hit . It 's all very well doing a version of Montagus and Capulets with sweeteners like dancing and schadenfreude-baiting Jewish society family tropes thrown in but there usually has to be an X Factor.Swayze probably makes this film safe with his rugged , post-Travolta moves and temperament but its being won over by this curly-mopped Penelope Pitstop teen that brings the dream in reach of the impressionable market . The super ( dated ? perhaps ' immortalised ' ) soundtrack helps and of course the cunning conceit of setting the film in a resort away from day to day life altogether finesses the fantasy . 7 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just saw this movie today with my children ( son , 10 and daughter , 4.5 ) at the 3rd Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival . After the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the Director , Tian-Ming Wu . He ( through a translator ) told several stories about his life and the making of the film.All tangents aside , both of my children really enjoyed this movie . Of course , I had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter , but much of the film is visually self-explanatory.I won 't give anything away , but the bottom line is that this film is SO MUCH better than 95 % of the Hollywood crap ( especially children 's films ) out there.Cheers.p.s. There is a " " real " " / original King of Masks who can / could do 12 masks at once .

" Oliver Stone hits the bull 's eye with this film , aided chiefly by Bogosian 's electrifying screen presence and biting , brilliant screenplay . Every moment crackles with a steadily-growing tension , climaxing in a truly , memorable movie-going experience . If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director 's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity , then this is it ! The result is a powerhouse achievement , made more timely now perhaps because of our culture 's disturbing fascination with celebrity , and it 's distorted interpretations of fame.An ultimate indictment of our society 's increasing morbidity , and self-sickening hunger for the next big thrill.A film not easily forgotten . I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" WrestleMania 6 took place April 1 , 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto , Ontario , Canada.Match 1 : Rick Martel vs. Koko B. Ware - For what it was , a very solid opening match . Koko was always fairly popular with the fans , and at this point Martel was still getting over as a heel talent . In the end Martel is able to snag the win in a pretty non memorable match.Match 2 : The Colossal Connection ( Andre The Giant & Haku ) ( c ) ( with Bobby ' The Brain ' Heenan ) vs Demolition ( Ax & Smash ) for the WWF Tag Team Championship - At this point Andre 's health was really awful , so his performance was really nothing special . The crowd is 100 % pro Demolition in this match . In the end Haku is pinned and we have New Tag Team Champions . After the match Andre lays out Haku and Heenan and turns face at what would turn out to be his last WrestleMania.Match 3 : Earthquack vs Hercules - Very short match . Big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time . R.I.P. to both men in the match . John Tenta ( Earthquake ) passed not that long ago and same with Hercules . In the end Earthquake pins Hercules for the win.Match 4 : Mr. Perfect vs Brutus " " The Barber " " Beefcake - The first really good match of the night . R.I.P. to Curt Henning ( Mr. Perfect ) . Really solid back and forth action from both of these talented guys . In the end Brutus gets the win thanks to a lot of his major fan support during the match.Match 5 : ' Rowdy ' Roddy Piper vs Bad News Brown - Not a technical classic , but a pretty decent brawl for WrestleMania . Piper comes out half black / half white in what is considerably a classic moment . In the end both guys fight to a double count out with no clear cut winner.Match 6 : The Hart Foundation vs The Bolsheviks - Complete squash match . The Hart Foundation gets an easy win . Surprising that WWE used to have a tag team division.Match 7 : The Barbarian vs Tito Santana - Bobby Heenan 's " " Heenan Family " " fairs better in this match as The Barbarian takes the win against Tito Santana . Not memorable , but good to go back and watch years later.Match 8 : Randy Savage & Sensational Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire - Big inter-gender tag team match . Dusty Rhodes wears the uncomfortable polka dot outfit out to the ring . In the end Rhodes and Sapphire get the win over " " The Macho King " " and Sensational Queen Sherri.Match 9 : The Rockers vs The Orient Express - Surprisingly another tag team match . Tag wrestling used to be so much better during this time period . A young Shawn Michaels and his partner Marty Jannetty take a loss by count out in this match to the Orient Express.Match 10 : Dino Bravo vs Jim Duggan - Duggan gets a decent reaction , despite his American Patriot gimmick . Bravo , a member of Jimmy Hart 's group , comes to the ring with Hart and Earthquake . Although he has support , Duggan takes the win.Match 11 : " " The Million Dollar Man " " Ted DiBiase ( c ) vs Jake ' The Snake ' Roberts for the Million Dollar Championship - The first major main event of the night . Roberts was extremely over with the fans . Match was considerably good for what it was . DiBiase is able to pick up a count out win on Roberts . But Roberts ends up possessing DiBiase 's money and giving it away.Match 12 : The Big Boss Man vs Akeem ( with Slick ) - One Man Gang 's sad attempt at being an African Dream named Akeem . A really short match that needed some more time to develop itself as a match . Boss Man wins with a slam.Match 13 : Jimmy " " Superfly " " Snuka vs Rick Rude - Heenan comes to the ring with Rude for this match . Snuka , never really got it good at WrestleMania . He always seemed to be on the losing end . After a short 5 minutes , Rude gets the win over Snuka.Match 14 : WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior - Dubbed as " " The Ultimate Challenge " " we get some interesting promos from both men earlier in the night . The match was actually very good , given that people tend to think Hogan can 't wrestle . A lot of near falls that really got the crowd and people that watch at home into it . In the end Warrior gets the win on Hogan and wins both titles . A stunned crowd looks on as Hulk Hogan suffers his first loss at WrestleMania . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept . 9 , 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival ( TIFF ) .This had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of eWaste ( recycled computers , keyboards , cables etc. shipped over to China by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back ) and other desolation.The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship . Still , what was there was interesting . The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens , intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking . The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well . Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were also a complement to the Jia Khang-je films at TIFF ( the feature Still Life / Sanxia Haoren & the documentary Dong ) which were also built around that subject.Director Jennifer Baichwal , Producer Nick de Pencier , Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q & A after the world premiere .

" I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show . I still vividly remember the film , especially the performance of Robert Taylor . I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid , almost dull leading man type , and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks . This film , however , proved what an interesting actor he could be . He did not get enough roles like this during his long career . This is his best performance . He is totally believable in a truly villainous role . From what I have read , he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles . He basically would just do what MGM gave him . This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles . The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolan 's character was . Nolan was a great actor , but this character really aggravated me . The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years . This film is definitely worth a look . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Consider for a moment what it must be like to be Uwe Boll . Somewhere , perhaps in those places that Jack Nicholson said ' you don 't talk about at parties ' , Boll knows that David Lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him . Gore Whores , metal-heads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the Teutonic helmsman 's output so bereft of originality , wit or imagination that he 's become the internet 's bogeyman 혯 an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement . Boll does his best to ride over these naysayers , exploiting tax credits available in Germany and Canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as Zero Mostel did with old ladies in The Producers . The difference being that Mostel 's character knew he was making bowel fill . Maybe Uwe knows it too.Such is the level of hostility toward each new ' Bollbuster ' that IMDb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before they 've seen it . Boll 's attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined . Indeed he 's probably the only filmmaker that 's boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage.This onslaught has made Uwe a very thick skinned man , so much so that he must feel like he 's wrapped in a carpet , but one who feels as if he 's bullied by the entire world . Like most people in that situation he lashes out , determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding Variety 's review of House of the Dead , never too far from the surface . This ' I know you are but what am I ' strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of Postal , which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 9 / 11 , Christian fundamentalism , Jihad , Nazism and paedophilia . Such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of Peter Cook and the visual imagination of Chris Morris but the closest Boll gets to either man is the o in their surname.In Seed , shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation , Boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer ( is there any other kind ? ) who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life . Mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free , though if you 'd been fried with that much electricity why would you want to , they pronounce him legally dead and bury him , only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolers.Boll begins his ' exploration of nihilistic rage ' with Seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes . From there we 're treated to the killer 's stock in trade 혯 kidnapping dogs , babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food . We 're invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are 혯 our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition . Yes , we 're worthless , gormless sadists and worse than that , we won 't give Uwe a good rating on the IMDb . In short , humanity is bunk.Of course you might think that Uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind it 's a bit of a bipolar piece , on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness 혯 the milk that poor old Boll has had to drink for so long , while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girth.The result says nothing about society and its discontents , more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director . Poor Uwe is obviously a very angry man 혯 one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair , no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasy 's about dispatching various web critics . That it 's there but takes an avant-garde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread , shows that Boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements . He 's made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate . " " I wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun " " Boll told the audience at the film 's world premiere and he has , on that flimsy manifesto , succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director 's detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker , he 'll need something genuine to say as well as a better , more original way of saying it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark ( but hopelessly contrived ) plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter ( as well as rolling your eyes with disbelief ) .It 's the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson . His hapless , nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals Chevy Chase.The thing about the film that appealed to me the most , however , is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train travel . They add a most welcome sense of realism and recognition.This thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its " " suspense " " from Hitchcock and should , in my opinion , only be watched for its comedy value ( which is high indeed ) . Besides Gustafsson , Lars Amble 's solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone.Heartily recommend . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have been waiting for such an original picture such as this for quite some time now . Brokedown Palace has that ' hard to believe ' aspect , however with the ingenious directing , and screenplay , 혩Palace scores big . I 've really never enjoyed watching Claire Danes in any of her movies , but I 'll tell you what , she really changed my mind with this one . Kate Beckinsale joins Danes on a vacation to Thailand where they meet up with a young man who convinces them to take a trip to Hong Kong with him . However , he neglected to inform them that they would be carrying an obscene amount of narcotics for him . Well , ultimately they get caught , and end up in a Thailand prison . I know , I know , how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs ? Well if you can get by that one tiny miscue , you will find a very well written , and acted out story . Lately I have found myself getting drawn into the storylines of the movies I watch , and developing a personal feeling for the characters that I watch . This movie is no different . By the end of the movie I found myself caring more for her than any of the other characters in the film . Bill Pullman plays Hank Green , an attorney who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations . As always Pullman delivers with an excellent performance and ties the movie together beautifully . There are a few twists and turns that will , by the end of the movie , have you in tears .

" I don 't think I 've really ever given Walter Matthau his due as a comedic performer . He 's certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles , but I guess I always put his success down to his characters ' grumpiness and ruthlessness , a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co-star Jack Lemmon , and , I suppose , a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures . Watching Gene Saks ' ' The Odd Couple ( 1968 ) , ' adapted from a popular Neil Simon play , the realisation suddenly clicked : Matthau is , in his own right , absolutely hilarious ! Initially striking the audience as filthy , crude and generally unappealing , his Oscar Madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts , culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that Matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own . At the same time , while holding his own as a comedian , his interplay with Lemmon is , of course , pitch-perfect ; indeed , the film rightly belongs to both actors , who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves , let alone together.Calling to mind Billy Wilder 's screenplay for ' The Apartment ( 1960 ) , ' this Neil Simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise . Compulsive house-cleaner Felix Unger ( Lemmon ) , having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years , attempts to commit suicide , but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window . Dejected , he arrives at the house of good friend Oscar ( Matthau ) , a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches ( that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat ! ) . Oscar kindly offers Felix a place to stay , but is soon overwhelmed by his friend 's finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness . The pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement , with Felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly-nagging wife , and Oscar as the sloppy , unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he 's supposed to . This is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks , and , by the end of it , we can completely sympathise with Felix 's ex-wife , who remains unseen . ' The Odd Couple ' is a terrific comedy , most of all because it has a lot of heart . For all their arguing , it 's obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other , most movingly seen when Felix tries to launch into a furious tirade , instead 혯 perhaps inadvertently 혯 ending up informing Oscar how " " tops " " he his . The pair 's four poker buddies ( John Fiedler , Herb Edelman , David Sheiner and Larry Haines ) are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance , but you can 't deny that they 've got the best of intentions . Their decision to treat Felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory , but maybe being ignored wasn 't quite the correct solution to Felix 's gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality . Unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays { I was recently disappointed by Wilder 's ' The Seven Year Itch ( 1955 ) } , this film doesn 't simply strike at the same chord throughout , and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed , through tears , laughter and much disagreement . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Quite simply the funniest and shiniest film-comedy of all time ... it 's certainly on my personal top-ten list . This one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale . Millionaire heir , Arthur Bach ( Moore ) , is a middle-aged ' child ' who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite responsibilities . He also refuses to leave the bottle . One day he and his personal butler , Hobson ( Gielgud ) , go shopping at Bergdorf Goodman 's and run into petty larcenist , Linda ( Minnelli ) . Arthur and Linda 's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film . There are hilarious set pieces aplenty . In one such scene , Arthur ( drunk throughout most of the story ) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human ' siren ' ( " " My husband has a gun ! ! ! ! ) . Performances by everyone involved should be duly noted : Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur 's loving-yet-ruthless grandmother , Sir John Gielgud almost steals the entire show with his acidic droll-isms ( He took home the Oscar for this one ) , and Christopher Cross provides the Main Theme song ( Oscar winner " " Best That You Can Do " " ) .

" This was directed by Ruggero Deodato , a true icon to many horror film fans after he directed the seminal and notorious Cannibal Holocaust . However , don 't expect to find any such notoriety in the film reviewed here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like a Conan inspired outing for a young audience.Such a description may instantly put off most fans of the whole Conan inspired Sword & Sorcery genre but before you turn your nose up at this , it has to be said , this movie is just so much fun ! It 's mostly played for laughs and features two HUGE and highly likable heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. the Barbarian Brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters.B-Movie favourite Richard Lynch turns up as the main villain in the piece and it 's also great to see roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman.Added to this , the ladies are stunning to behold and suitably scantily attired throughout the films duration ( a staple and much welcomed ingredient in the genre ! ) What can I say , - this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre and I recommend it wholeheartedly ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Francis Ford Coppola 's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema . In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance , open-mindness , and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had . I am not a historian , but all the events that preceded the decade ( a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes , the racial struggles , the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture , the increase of violence and death in the streets ... ) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare , be different , and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures . Coppola 's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making , following the parameters of war and adventure films , and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life , the reason of death , or the ethics of war . It is also a passionate work , made against all odds , chronicled in the 1991 documentary " " Hearts of Darkness : A Filmmaker 's Apocalypse " " ; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen . This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture , but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously , " " The Deer Hunter " " and " " Coming Home " , " or in latter ones as " " Platoon " " and " " Casualties of War " , " before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre , as horror in " " Jacob 's Ladder " , " or comedies as " " Good Morning , Vietnam " , " among the more respectable . Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life , without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly towards the climax yielding a twist that really is hard to take seriously . I think , though , that the build-up to it works rather well . The music , quite menacing and spine-tingling , really provides a spooky aura matching the unforgiving sound of a constant ringing telephone that is driving struggling English actress , Joan Matlin ( Jean Marsh ) bonkers . She 's borrowing a pal 's nice apartment while attempting to jump-start her career in New York City ( .. the city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as David Letterman 's ) and is unceremoniously welcome by a noisy telephone which rings quite a bit , followed by loud slams against the wall . Searching for answers regarding the one responsible for such disregard towards her sanity , Joan discovers that no one rents that room , and that a former tenant had in fact strangled herself . Without help from the manager , Joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish . Joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her.The episode , I think , is a tour-de-force for Jean Marsh who is a one woman show . She 's the only actress visible and we follow her through the crisis which slowly erodes her , the phone and the banging from that other room causing her much distress which grows into fear . Instead of leaving , Joan remains , so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wishes for the phone ( .. or whoever is ringing ) to stop . The episode provides a possible answer as to who is plaguing Joan and why . A character named Beth comes into the story rather late as Joan struggles to find out whose female voice it was across the other line who knew her name on that dreaded phone she discovers in the room across from hers . The fate of Beth might just tell the viewer why Joan is being traumatized . I think this episode is an exercise in spooks instead of credibility ; some didn 't particularly like it , but I certainly did . I will admit that the phone , as a physical menace " " crawling " " towards Joan is hard to take seriously , not to mention it 's attack on her , but I thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this were suitably chilling enough to make up for it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film is a perfect example of great escapism ! I loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning . Sure it 's just an action flick , but isn 't having fun what watching movies is all about ? The cast of this film are very strong with likable characters . The friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing , it 's heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact - especially this group of boys ! ! Sean Astin makes a great rebel , successfully avoiding being a precocious teenager.If you want fun , watch this film ! I thoroughly enjoyed it even though I was watching it on a very dirty and old VHS that was terrible quality ( Go DVD 's ! ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Arthur Penn , director of Bonnie and Clyde and Little Big Man , saw that Steve Tesich 's outstanding script rang with truth , and from these two talents comes solid cinema .

" Wow baby , this is indeed some fine Asian horror / gore , and a crazy outlandish movie . This is a Japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of Tetsuo , except in this case with all the blood and guts , there is a bizarre love story . It 's hard to imagine how they even dreamed up this visually stunning movie , with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites , turning them into part machine or I guess cyborgs . The only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human , is they need to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm , yum yum . This would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that , with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun . The movie also borrows a little from Carpenter 's " " The Thing " " in creature design and effects . I would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds , as there is non-stop carnage and some very fine gore . And a must-have for stoners , because you don 't even need to read the sub-titles , the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip . The design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of Frank Henenlotter 's movies , which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour . " " Meatball Machine " " is great fun for gorehounds , there is no doubt about it , and I simply loved it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you are a fan , then you will probably enjoy this . If you don 't know who Misty Mundae , Darian Caine , Ruby LaRocca , or Seduction Cinema are , this is not the movie to start out with . It 's very cute , silly , the girls are hot , and it 's fun to watch . There 's no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film , but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot 's not a total bore . Misty Mundae 's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids , so she 's not as hot in this as she has been in others . But her panties in this are quite cute ( you 'll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird ) . If you do like this one , you will probably enjoy " " That 70 's Girl " , " " " Vampire Vixens " , " or " " Erotic Survivor " " ( which is a bit more sexually graphic ) . If you prefer watching Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual , more horror / exploitation-based ( but lower budget ) movies , check out the Factory 2000 website . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Everyone is entitled to an opinion . The only critic who counts is yourself . I think this is a great movie . Much better than the original.In " " Caddyshack " , " Rodney Dangerfield is funny , but obnoxious . He was asked to do the sequel , but things got in the way . Jackie Mason shows the saying that " " less is more " . " He is funny , but a man with real family issues , a more rounded person . It 's no drama , but a movie that makes you feel .

" Obsession comes in many flavors , and exists for a variety of reasons ; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder , but for others it may be an avenue of survival . Lack of nurturing , combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements , may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone . And in extreme cases , the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession , driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing , and as we discover in ' The Luzhin Defence , ' directed by Marleen Gorris , a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem , and in fact , may actually exacerbate the situation . Obsession , it seems , has no prejudice or preference ; moreover , it gives no quarter . At an Italian resort in the 1920 's , Alexander Luzhin ( John Turturro ) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament , the winner of which will be the World Champion . Luzhin is a Master of the game , but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him ; rather , it is his obsession , that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life , and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family . So Luzhin is a genius with an Achilles heel , a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands , and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament . That man is Valentinov ( Stuart Wilson ) , Luzhin 's former mentor , who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to Luzhin . Valentinov is an unwelcomed , disconcerting presence to Luzhin , and once again life threatens to overwhelm him . Not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament , Turati ( Fabio Sartor ) , against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours , but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he 's just met at the resort , Natalia ( Emily Watson ) . And , genius though he may be , dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push Luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace , as well the curse , of his entire life . To tell Luzhin 's story , Gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess . And as his background is established , it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who Luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life . For the scenes of his childhood , Gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into , and underlies , the present , more pastoral setting of the resort . The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled , and with the pace Gorris sets it makes for a riveting , yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well . She also underplays the menace produced by the presence of Valentinov , concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense , which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film , making Luzhin 's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling . The single element that makes this film so memorable , however , is the affecting performance of John Turturro . For this film to work , Luzhin must be absolutely believable ; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous , as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately . It doesn 't happen , however , and the film does work , because the Luzhin Turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life . He captures Luzhin 's genius , as well as his inadequacies , and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real . It 's a performance equal to , if not surpassing , Geoffrey Rush 's portrayal of David Helfgott in ' Shine . ' And when you compare his work here with other characters he 's created , from Sid Lidz in ' Unstrung Heroes ' to Pete in ' O Brother Where Art Thou ? ' to Al Fountain in ' Box of Moonlight , ' you realize what an incredible range Turturro has as an actor , and what a remarkable artist he truly is . As Natalia , Emily Watson is excellent , as well , turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely . Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to Luzhin , Watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective . Most importantly , because of the detail she brings to her performance , it makes her accelerated relationship with Luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story . You have but to look into Watson 's eyes to know that the feelings she 's conveying are real . It 's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor . The supporting cast includes Geraldine James ( Vera ) , Christopher Thompson ( Stassard ) , Peter Blythe ( Ilya ) , Orla Brady ( Anna ) , Mark Tandy ( Luzhin 's Father ) , Kelly Hunter ( Luzhin 's Mother ) , Alexander Hunting ( Young Luzhin ) and Luigi Petrucci ( Santucci ) . Well crafted and delivered , ' The Luzhin Defence ' is an emotionally involving film , presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man 's inhumanity to man . We don 't need a movie , of course , to tell us that there is cruelty in the world ; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget , inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change , and to make a difference in the lives of those around us . I rate this one 9 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
First of all that I would like to say is that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee is looking much better than before XD ! This is probably one of the most original movies I have seen so far ; shows a poverty lifestyle background of a Cambodian . The Cambodian ( Edison aka Pang ) goes around killing people to survive himself ; has done it throughout his entire life . Sam Lee 's ( Wai ) duty is to capture the Cambodian for good . There are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it . The movie shows the struggles between those two characters ; they both beat each other like angry dogs . GO AND WATCH PPL ...

" One of my favourite films first saw it when I was about 10 , which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour . Although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it .

The lady with the parrot , the couple due to get married and are in trouble from ' her ' , and my favourite , the stationmaster , " " Nobody knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where it goes ..

" The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors , the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances . This typical rising-star musical has an overworked plot , even for 1944 , but because of the actors it 's still fun to watch . Hayworth isn 't even that much of a dancer , but she has a lot of ' inexperienced ' charm that fits her character . Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while Silvers provides plenty of self-deprecation and laughs . The movie can also be very serious at times .

" Those of you who know the group dEUS , know the lead singer Tom Barman . He directed this movie a bit like he creates music , it 's a mix of everything . This is a comedy , though mostly absurd and cynical , a drama , none of the main characters have a happy life to say the least , and it does not really have a goal.The movie starts on a friday morning in Antwerp , Belgium , with scenes of several persons , some of them have nothing in common but they will come in contact with each other during the day and night . There are several main characters : a teacher who writes books nobody reads , a young researcher with a morbid taste of death and his sister , a gallery owner , two young men constantly in touch with the law , a man who works in a movie theater and two young women . Throughout the movie there walks a man who has something to do with wind . All characters have their troubles , with their family or friends or just with life itself.The movie is set in Antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and the port . The events of the day are not easily explained , I advise to simply watch the movie , there is simply too much to tell . But I can say this , Barman has an excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music ( mostly dance music , not really rock ) to set a mood , especially the party is filled with excellent music.This movie is an experience on itself , it will not leave you any wiser about life , perhaps only that you have to live it and not waste it , or have any false moral truths.In short , see it , it is definitely worth it ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It is interesting to see what people think of this movie , since it is , in fact , quite unique ( though it bears some of the trademarks of Clive Barker 's writing ) . Even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so , the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard Hollywood plot hooks , and layered , so that if you expect to be fed , you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot.Those who need a linear , specific and untangled plot line will hate this movie , because the story lies , like in the novella , partially between the lines , or in this case , partially off screen , in comments and the imagination.Another possible hang-up is the ending , of which I can say , without spoiling it , that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad . It is , in fact , not very defined at all , which I know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didn 't get to know what happened , but to me , and to many others , I 'm sure , just adds another dimension to the story - the dimension of speculation , and , in addition , the point that great disruption has a tendency to cause ripples that extend quite far.There is definitely moral here , but of a rather different kind than the standard Hollywood in-your-face-at-the-end-of-the-movie sort of display . Summing that moral up is simple , even though it is not quite that simply displayed ; prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different.I love this movie , even though , as many of the reviewers have noted , the expressions of the actors ( with the exception of David Cronenberg , who does a wonderful appearance ) are rather tacky . I 'm not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth , though , seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay.All in all , this is a great movie , provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A lot of the user comments i have seen on the IMDB for this movie don 't really do it justice . First of all , let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously .

If you watch this movie with the intent to see a masterpiece in either filmmaking or in humour , then you will be sorely disappointed . Yet , if you want to just watch a goofy movie with some talented actors / actresses , and some good catch-phrases , then you will enjoy it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Dolelemite ( 1975 ) is a cult classic . Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the MAN along the way .

" I have watched this movie at least 30 times , maybe more , and each time I watch it I am drawn into the movie and back to 1963 !

Johnny is persuaded by Penny and his cousin Billy ( Neal Jones ) that he can teach Baby to do the dance in time for the show . Baby learning the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes ! Baby 's father ( Doctor Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach ) comes to Penny 's rescue when the abortion is done wrong . Dirty Dancing brought back to me this time in history when girls got pregnant and had abortions in back rooms by butchers . Around this time ( 1963 ) many girls actually died from this type of abortion - but there were not many choices for a girl then.Lonnie Price plays a great conceited grandson ( Neil Kellerman ) to Jack Weston 's Max Kellerman . Jane Brucker does a great job as Baby 's annoying sister Lisa Houseman.The music is great and the dancing is wonderful ! The " " dirty dancers " " are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel Baby 's astonishment when she first sees them dancing and says , " " Where 'd they learn to do that ? " . " Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles . Patrick 's song , " " She 's Like The Wind " " brings tears to my eyes each time I hear / watch it in this movie.The movie ends on an up note , but leaves you wanting to know what happens next in Baby 's and Johnny 's lives . Dirty Dancing gives something new each time it is watched - It mesmerizes the watcher with nostalgia , a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people . There are only three locations ( the school , the store , and the coach 's house ) that are really used . It 's primarily at the coach 's house , however . A movie doesn 't need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself.Four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up . One is rich , important , and has no real love outside of money . One wants to be mayor again , but his competition is turning him sour . One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family . One is a traveling alcoholic.First off , I love the actors in this film . They 've all been household names to me . They proved their worth here.One of the most pivotal moments is when Tom , played by Gary Sinise , blows up on the coach . He yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game . His blows the coach 's whistle and yells back his catchphrases - " " Forgive me Father , for I have sinned !

" While I don 't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies , Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain ( especially since I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray ) . Boy , is she so convincingly evil here as a witch , especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end ! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who 's forced to hide " " in the closet " " to protect his " " reputation " " ! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes , Rupert Everett , Ricky Gervais , Peter O 'Toole and many others do fine work here . While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties , there 's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller , Olivia Grant ( as Girl Bernard ) , and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her . Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan ( actually Ben Barnes ) . Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances , the main difference was that with PB , you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson . Stardust makes you believe , for the most part , that what you 're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout . So on that note , I highly recommended Stardust . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Doctors advised his parents he was hopelessly mentally retarded but his mother didn 't give up on him and , somewhat as Annie Sullivan had done with Helen Keller , helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then to read , write , and paint.This film won Academy Awards for Daniel Day-Lewis ( best actor ) as well as best supporting actress for the actress playing his mother ; it also received Oscar nominations for best picture , best director , and best adapted screenplay.As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist , while many films may entertain me , many also often leave me having to overlook gross fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions.Not this film--it was absolutely " " spot on " " in portraying typical Irish parental roles & behaviors ( see , e.g. , see typical Irish families in McGoldrick 's " " Ethnicity & Family Therapy " " ) as well Christy Brown 's uneven emotional maturation--some immature personality reactions that were even further amplified by his picking up traits of his father.The film presents the greater truth while changing certain sequences in his development ( painting & writing ) and condensing several important people into one person , for the sake of telling a coherent , believable story , not burdened by small , distracting , less important actualities . ( See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy . ) The DVD version we were shown had some English subtitles that were a great help in understanding Christy 's speech ( & some of the Irish speech ) ; the initial release of the film may have lacked this . ( If you see this on DVD , enable that option . ) The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest , believable acting jobs I 've ever seen . Truly magnificent , outstanding , superlative . " " My Left Foot " " bears more than some similarity to a more recent film , " " The Diving Bell & the Butterfly , " " in that each portrays the life of a real person successfully surmounting the imprisonment and isolation of an extremely severe physical handicap.And in doing so , it resonates with William Ernest Henley 's " " Invictus " " which begins : " " Out of the night that covers me , / / Black as the Pit from pole to pole , / / I thank whatever gods may be / / For my unconquerable soul . " " , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow , I loved this film . It may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch . The tale revolves around this one family from Utah and it 's the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch . The main lead ( Giovanni Ribisi ) plays his part very well , at no time does he leave you to believe that he 's acting all his feelings . It 's his brother ( Elias Koteas ) who stole the show for me though . When the two were in scenes together they bounded their lines off of each other , giving fantastic performances . Great cast , great film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One hilarious thing I 'll say off the top , is I 'm not the biggest Seisun Suzuki fan . I 've actually seen a fair number of his works ( thanks to a retrospective the film festival had ) and I found his films just a wee too Yakuza-driven for my tastes . So , I went into Princess Raccoon wary of what I was going to see . Boy ! Was I knocked out ! ' Raccoon ' is Suzuki 's attempt at a musical , using the elements of Japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements ( both Audial and Visual ) , Raccoon is a treat from start to finish . The lead actor , Joe Ogdari , proves that he 's one of the hottest actors in Japan these days in this role . I have to admire that the younger Japanese actors still take roles that take place in Feudal-times Japan , dressing up in Samurai gear to full effect . The story itself does get a bit confusing , if you don 't follow it really closely , but even if you don 't , prepare yourself for the treasures that Princess Raccoon has . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Other commentators have detailed the plot and the social parables and commentary as well ( or better ) that I could , but I would like to join in my admiration for this little jewel of a film . It holds up very well indeed more that 50 years later in every category - screenplay , acting , photography , set design , sound design ... it really is a classic of sorts . This was my first exposure to the " " young " " Alec Guinness , and it 's obvious from the first frames what made him so special as to eventually receive a knighthood . I only rate it an " " 8 " " because it 's essentially a rather lightweight parable that examines human nature but doesn 't really skewer it ; and because the plot takes the easy way out at the end , rather than actually resolving conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists who are chasing him all over town . Also , a couple minutes of thought reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the screenplay - wear and tear is hardly ever the determining factor in buying new clothes ( especially dress clothes ) ; children grow up , people change sizes , gain and lose weight , and go with the latest fashions all the time , and have as long as looms have woven cloth . And if nothing else , the manufacturer would make a fortune providing indestructible material for military uniforms ( especially BDUs ) . Still , this is a great film . If you get a chance to see it on a classic movie channel , you should . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This show is sheer entertainment and doesn 't try to be a Greek drama . It certainly contains elements of one what with all the plot twists , but it 's immensely engaging and fun . Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never have a lack of material to work with ! Anything and Everything DOES happen there ! The actors in this show are extremely personable and you really do want to see what they are up to and into each week . The show is also very funny . The humor arises from the characters and situations . Not just thrown in gratuitously . It 's a well-crafted show in that regard . It certainly makes me look forward to Friday nights and I 'm glad I now own the first two seasons on DVD ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s , the names of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films . After being Universal 's " " first monster " " in the seminal classic , " " Dracula " , " Bela Lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent ( sadly , this last factor would also led him to be type-casted during the 40s ) . In the same way , Boris Karloff 's performance in James Whale 's " " Frankenstein " " transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster . Of course , it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen , and the movie that united them was 1934 's " " The Black Cat " . " This formula would be repeated in several films through the decade , and director Lambert Hillyer 's mix of horror and science fiction , " " The Invisible Ray " , " is another of those minor classics they did in those years.In " " The Invisible Ray " , " Dr. Janos Rukh ( Boris Karloff ) is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet 's past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of Andromeda . While showing his invention to his colleagues , Dr. Felix Benet ( Bela Lugosi ) and Sir Francis Stevens ( Walter Kingsford ) , they discover that thousands of years ago , a meteor hit in what is now Nigeria . After this marvelous discovery , Dr. Rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to Africa , looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor . This expedition won 't be any beneficial for Rukh , as during the expedition his wife Diane ( Frances Drake ) will fall in love with Ronald Drake ( Frank Lawton ) , an expert hunter brought by the Stevens to aid them in their expedition . However , Rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip , as he 'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor.Written by John Colton ( who previously did the script for " " Werewolf of London " " ) , " " The Invisible Ray " " had its roots on an original sci-fi story by Howard Higgin and Douglas Hodges . Given that this was a movie with Karloff and Lugosi , Colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story , playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up . One element that makes " " The Invisible Ray " " to stand out among other horror films of that era , is the way that Colton plays with morality through the story . That is , there aren 't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style , but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices . In many ways , " " The Invisible Ray " " is a modern tragedy about obsessions , guilt and revenge.A seasoned director of low-budget B-movies , filmmaker Lambert Hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for Universal Pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles . Thanks to his experience working with limited resources , Hillyer 's films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains , and " " The Invisible Ray " " was not an exception . While nowhere near the stylish Gothic atmosphere of previous Universal horror films , Hillyer 's movie effectively captures the essence of Colton 's script , as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci-fi . Finally , a word must be said about Hillyer 's use of special effects : for an extremely low-budget film , they look a lot better than the ones in several A-movies of the era.As usual in a movie with Lugosi and Karloff , the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality . As the film 's protagonist , Boris Karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes . As his colleague , Dr. Benet , Bela Luogis is simply a joy to watch , stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was . As Rukh 's wife , Frances Drake is extremely effective , truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress . Still , two of the movie highlights are the performances of Kemble Cooper as Mother Rukh , and Beulah Bondi as Lady Arabella , as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time , making unforgettable their supporting roles . Frank Lawton is also good in his role , but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast.If one judges this movie under today 's standards , it 's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience . However , that would be a mistake , as despite its low-budget , it is remarkably well done for its time . On the top of that , considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept , it 's ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate . One final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters , specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive Dr. Rukh and the cold Dr. Benet , as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors.While nowhere near the Gothic expressionism of the " " Frankenstein " " movies , nor the elegant suspense of " " The Black Cat " , " Lambert Hillyer 's " " The Invisible Ray " " is definitely a minor classic amongst Universal Pictures ' catalog of horror films . With one of the most interesting screenplays of 30s horror , this mixture of suspense , horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had : Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi . 8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " The Ladies Man " " suffers a common problem among movies based on " " Saturday Night Live " " skits . And that is , a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes . Although this movie does have its laughs , like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps , a sex-maniac straight out of the ' 70s , and Will Ferrell as a wrestling-obsessed husband cuckolded by Leon . So this movie is funny enough , but it 's no " " Wayne 's World " " ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film is full of interesting ideas . Some scenes are truly hilarious . The dialogs are witty and colloquial . The tension in the film comes not so much from the ' murder mystery ' plot as from the relationship between the characters . The film tells two stories in parallel.The first story involves the characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz . Trintignant is an ageing drifter , with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness , who is followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with plenty of good-natured smiles . Many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters , for example when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to be intimidating.The second story tells how a salesman , played by Jean Yanne , gives up his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend . Yanne plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony . I wish I could describe this better.After a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and they meet indeed in the end , in a surprising but also logical ending.The film is a successful mixture of the witty but superficial gangster films the director 's father ( the celebrated Michel Audiard ) used to write , and the " " typical french film " " with lots of psychological depth and lots of care in the display of emotions . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you have any kind of heart and compassion for people , this is a tough movie to watch , at least in the second half of it . It 's in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded ( mentally- challenged ) man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child . It 's not pleasant material.However , it 's a good movie and the acting is good , too . The story will sit with you awhile . " " Dominick " " is the mentally-disabled guy and is played by Tom Hulce . I think this might be Hulce 's best role ever . He 's looked after by a med student , " " Eugene , " " played by Ray Liotta , who became a star the following year with Kevin Costner 's " " Field Of Dreams . " " Dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads " " Hulk " " comic books and loves wrestling . He 's the type of " " slow " " guy that you can 't help but love and root for to live a happy life . When he freaks out , it 's for several good reasons and ... well , see the film for the whole story . It 's worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Frustrated middle-aged Deputy District Attorney George Maxwell ( a fine performance by George E. Carey , who also produced this picture ) can 't stand his naggy , frigid wife Edith ( a perfectly bitchy Anne Bellamy ) anymore . Worse yet , poor George is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter ( dishy brunette Sheri Jackson ) . George has an adulterous fling with lovely , enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter Candy Wilson ( delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout Patricia Wymer ) . Complications ensue when George finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter Julia Freeman ( a nicely venomous turn by Kathy Williams ) , who wants George to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend Laurence Mackey ( a frightening Robert Tessier , who sports a head full of hair here ) from jail . Director Tom Laughlin ( yep , the same dude who portrayed Billy Jack ! ) and screenwriter James McLarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity , sizzling soft-core sex , and raw violence . Moreover , they accurately peg the whole wild 'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the 60 's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time , thus ensuring that this movie doesn 't overstay its welcome . One definite highlight occurs when Candy invites her groovy friends over the Maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking , wailing rock music , and , of course , hot naked dancing chicks . Robert O. Ragland 's funky score hits the gnarly spot . Stanton Fox 's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on . Best of all , this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie Patricia Wymer , who positively lights up the screen with her sweet , bubbly personality and captivating beauty .

" If you are already a fan of Peter O 'Donnell 's wonderful Modesty Blaise books from the sixties , you will really enjoy this movie . If you have ever seen the 1966 " " Modesty Blaise " " film , forget it ! That was camp . This is the real Modesty Blaise . The story and character are both true to the Modesty that fans of the books know and love . It 's a long way from Joe Losey 's 1966 travesty , and it takes our Modesty quite seriously . Alexandra Staden is quite good and believable in the part , and yes , we do get to see her kick butt. chuckleThis is likely meant to be the first movie of a series and as such it serves to introduce Modesty , her childhood and her days with Lob.Since Peter O 'Donnell was the creative consultant on the movie , everything really rings true . Even the story O 'Donnell told of how he conceived the character is just as he told it . Having read all the books , I enjoyed the movie even more for that.Now that Miramax has kept their option on the property by having Quentin Tarrentino make this film , I do hope to see more of the Modesty stories asap . Especially as the wonderful character of Willie Garvin makes Modesty 's character really come alive . To that end , I really hope the film does well in Europe . I have no idea if Miramax intends to ever distribute the DVD in the USA . I suspect it might not do that well in the USA in general distribution . I wonder how Miramax decides where and how to distribute it 's films.In the story , Modesty is in her early 20 's , working at Louche 's casino in Tangier . The flashback sequences are artfully done and take Modesty from about 9 years old , through her teens up to her current age in the movie - about 21-22 , I 'd guess . I really don 't think there 's a " " perfect actress " " for Modesty . For many of us Modesty fans , she 's much too powerful a presence in our imaginations already . Alexandra Staden is credible . She is very slim , graceful and poised . She has lots of closeups . She has a great face - one that sticks in your mind well after the movie is over . According to O ' Donnell 's illustrator , Romero , Modesty has rather a fuller figure than Staden , but I 'm willing to overlook that . If Staden continues in the role , I think she will mature into it - just as Modesty grows more powerful and skilled as she gets older . Staden already conveys Modesty 's humor and absolute assurance very well . Go ahead and rent this movie , it 's not like anything else you 've seen and even though it was directed by Scott Spiegel , it is full of Tarrentino touches , great camera moves , lighting and well-done action sequences . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First time I ever felt I needed to write a review.I have seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a wide range of movies . I am reasonably opened minded , and can easily say I enjoyed a movie while still saying " " yeah it was not good but I enjoyed it " . " I can appreciate the mastery of great movies like The Shaw shank redemption , the godfather , and American history X. I can like good movies in a genre like horror , or comedy , even if the movie might not be that great . I can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me ( Bloodsport ) . I also will try to rate movie fairly even if I did not like it . City lights by Charlie Chapin was not a movie I enjoyed , but I can appreciate the acting and story lines for the time.I think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly click a rating , should take a few ideas into account . Try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was . Do not let your personal bias affect the rating . Also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to rate.This " " movie " " was the worst piece of trash I have ever seen . 2 hours of my life where just stolen . The acting was awful , across the board . The scenes where choppy at best . However the real disgrace was the story . The first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to B. However after that it was a nightmare . They kept trying to add new elements but nothing was every explained . Nothing really ever made sense , was steward dead , is he alive , did he hit by lighting , was it really lighting , was it aliens , is he an alien , etc . The ending tied nothing together and really did not answer any questions . The only positive was nobody cared we where just happy to leave the theater.6.5 / 10 ? ? ? What is wrong with some of you ? I will admit that the 8 of us where so mad about seeing this , we did think " " what would make it better ? " , " and we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie . What can I say misery loves company . That is really the only reason I can see for a 6.5 rating.Do not waste your life ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right ! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump , and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude . He is Jacob Goodnight ( WWE 's Glen " " KANE " " Jacobs ) , a 7 ' monster who wields a Axe , and a hook and chain . Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets . That is totally methodical ! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier , Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head . How on Earth did Goodnight survive after 4 years ? Now he 's in the condemned hotel called Blackwell . And this hotel got a lot of stories to tell . I thought this movie was haunting as well as interesting . I liked the part where Goodnight checked out one of the girl 's tattoo on her back . And Goodnight himself is really deranged thanks to his maniacal mother . If you think Friday the 13th was something , you better think again . This movie will leave you on the edge of you seat . And I think the eyeball rip was bone-chilling .

" Formulaic to the max . Neither title reflects the serial 's actual content , " " Fighting Nazis in Morocco , " " ( actually , the Iverson ranch ) . The plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights . The packaging claims over 40 ' fistic encounters ' in 15 chapters . That 's at least three a chapter ! Aside from seeing Duncan Renaldo cast as a Spanish accented Frenchman , watching how much furniture is overturned , smashed , thrown , burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about . When the protagonists start fighting , you can bet that everything in the room will be in it , too . So , kudos to the fight choreographer , who is the real star of this serial ! Two positive notes : the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights , and best of all , we have the girl side kick ( often a journalist , as she is here ) actually participating in the mayhem , mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys . Yet to come is Linda Stirling killing the main villain in " " Manhunt of Mystery Island " " ( 1945 ) . On the negative side , there are just too many jump out of the way escapes-- before the slab falls , before the car goes over the cliff , before the speedboat explodes , before the building explodes , before the truck hits you , etc. etc.It is claimed that this serial partially ' inspired ' George Lucas to make the first Indiana Jones film , but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the serial 's development.Rod Cameron ' shines ' as a moving rock , a role he played in all his films . Other than watching all the furniture getting smashed , there 's nothing really going on here , compared to other serials that have fewer fights , more story , better actors and more developed characters.I give it a 3 for all the furniture smashing . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a film that has it all , the dashing hero , the beautiful damsel in distress , the noble figure with the tragic flaw , and a truly wonderful robot . Forbidden Planet has maintained that special magic over the years and doesn 't lose its flavor with repeated viewings ( although the sex appeal of the youthful Anne Francis helps considerably on that score ) .Movie fans will recognize the youngish Leslie Nielsen portraying the handsome and heroic Commander Adams , although those of us who have grown fond of him in comedic roles will perhaps be a bit taken aback by his appearance in a serious role . The distinguished and noble-looking Walter Pidgeon is also a featured player as the scientist with a secret ( Id ) . Other supporting cast deserve a nod , especially Warren Stevens as the brainy and resourceful " " Doc " , " and of course the charms of Miss Francis , as noted above.This film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music , in the 1950s , no less . The credits call them " " tonalities " , " but those of us who tried to tinker together early versions of the " " Theremin " " device will recognize the eerie and spooky whines and screeches sometimes used in the sound track . Still , it lends to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and forbidding world of the Krell.The special effects are also quite arresting . I recall my fear as a youngster waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible " " Id " " monster , and when it is finally visualized in the one battle scene it literally shook me to my toes in wonder and awe . The magic of matte art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the Krell scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various labyrinths and passageways , guided by the enigmatic Dr. Morbius.I recall feeling some measure of jealously that Dr. Morbius would have such a cool toy in the form of Robby the Robot . The persona of Robby is quite charming and in some ways he seems more human than some of the other characters . Viewers of follow-on shows like Twilight Zone and Lost In Space will recognize the recycled Robby prop in some of those episodes , although I recall he never had the " " personality " " of the original Robby.I must admit to not fully understanding the complexities of the plot until I was old enough to understand the various references to Freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and rage we carry within but have trained ourselves , through force of will , to submerge and control through adherence to societal codes . Although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed , it remains unknown ( or perhaps deliberately overlooked ) by Dr. Morbius until pointed out by the clear-thinking Commander Adams , who forces Dr. Morbius to confront the evil within himself . It still gives me goose bumps when Commander Adams pushes Dr. Morbius down before the Krell machine that endowed him with superior intellect , which opened the flood gates of his subconscious to the power of the Krell machine : " " Here . Here is where your mind was artificially enlarged . Consciously it still lacked the power to operate the Great Machine . But your subconscious had been made strong enough . " " Zowee ! Forbidden Planet remains probably my favorite sci-fi film ever , and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful visualization and realization on the screen . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The idea is a very smart title the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it . But it is so subtle you don 't know how to read it ! Are these guys doing a full blown comedy or is there something else going on . The little dialogue the film has isn 't very delicate and this adds to the power of the film . If all the sound was switched off from the film it actually wouldn 't take anything away from the film . The physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it on its own carries the entirety of the story.I is a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame . I first say this film as part of a " " black " " film festival . After watching the film i was so impressed by the work . But then i asked myself what next ? Where can someone else see this work ? The common association of art without purpose isn 't to be found here . You can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish . The usage of African music the style the casting everything seems planned and for a reason . The character development is amazing . The casting i think is the strongest aspect of the film ; the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of actual film.We need to see more of these kinds of films , there really needs to be greater support for the development of short films across the board . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is one of my 3 favorite movies . I 've been out on the water since I was 13 , so I got a lot of the humor as well as recognizing a lot of the near-land scenery ( the movie , although taking place in and around Virginia , was filmed around the San Francisco Bay ) , most notably the mothball fleet just east of the Benicia Bridge where Kelsey Grammar 's character was first introduced to the USS Stingray , and the piers of San Francisco at the very end of the movie ( including a boat that I 've worked on ) . As other people have said , the actors appeared to have fun making this movie as well as making it entertaining . The line " " We 're approaching the bottom , sir ! I can hear a couple of lobsters duking it out " " is , at least to me , priceless.I am one of numerous people who is anxiously awaiting a letterboxed DVD of Down Periscope to be introduced . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hayao Miyazaki name became prominent with Spitied Away , however what is often overlooked are director 's first film efforts . Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138 ? I remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation . So when I found a copy in a well known store for 짙9 I couldn 't resist but buy it . The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it ( memory is funny that way ) .Viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like Jean ' Moebius ' Giraud some of the artwork is . I can only assume some influence here.When Pazu catches a falling girl ( Sheeta ) his adventure really begins - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift 's overlooked portion of Gulliver 's Travels . With healthy references to Jules Verne it 's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on Laputa.This is the portion that is strongest in my memory - the ' pastoral ' ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree . This is , in my opinion , the highlight of the movie - the views of the surface of Laputa , as opposed to the mechanised underground.Although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals . The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same.It is incredibly stylish , I would not say ' slick ' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings , airships and the design and look of just about everything.Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime .

Yeah , nowadays , it 's a crime to show naked children on the screen , but we were screwing at 16 , why not these kids ? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl , then rich dad steals him away from her at the end , after she gives birth under impoverished conditions . She is left alone with child . It is a love story and a " " growing up " " story . The music is fantastic , and the story is one any person could relate to . May be someday this will be released on DVD . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Now my friends , films like " " La B챗te " " ( aka " " The Beast " " or " " O Monstro " " ) only can be done in the old continent : ) , in this film we see all : horses dirty sex , nymphomaniac kind off gorilla , non sense dialogs , etc , etc , etc ... In the serious terms now , its an allegory , that men sometimes could be bestial , visceral and brutal , Walerian Borowczyk ( the director ) shows us the loss of innocence , sexual violence , rape and brutality . Its a astonishing cinematic experience , bizarre and full of grotesque scenes . For all fans of European shocking exploitation , i recommend this film.If you like this one i recommend : " " Orloff Against the Invisible Man " " and " " Alterated States " .

" I see quite a few positive reviews on this board , trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following . I see the usual ranting-- " " I guess this movie is just not for the easily offended , " " " " This movie is not Shakespeare , " " etc . Guess what ? Neither was " " Road Trip " " ! And I laughed my a * * off during that movie ! There 's a way to make a crude , tasteless comedy and deliver laughs ; and there 's a way to ... just make it crude and tasteless . " " Whipped " " tries to be " " Swingers " " without the wit or intelligence . It seems to have been written through the puerile eyes of a 14-year-old boy . For God 's sake , the characters in this movie are supposed to be white-collar , upright citizens--and they talk like some of the idiots I knew in freshman year of high school ! The dialogue is laced--more like drowned--with four-letter words . You would think that people of their status would have SOME degree of intelligence--and a more extensive vocabulary . Just watch a Whit Stillman film and you 'll see the difference . Not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish . If you know any successful , white-collar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movie--please let me know and introduce me to them . Their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty . There is absolutely NO insight into relationships , sex or ... anything ! ! ! It 's just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremely--and don 't take the word " " extremely " " for granted , because I mean it with all my heart--crude gags . These are gags with no substance . Gags that are meant more for groans than laughs . The scene at the end between Amanda Peet and her girlfriends was totally un-called for and totally unconvincing . There are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by ( straight ) men and play out wonderfully . This scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures . It involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a woman 's mouth . It was one of those noticeably-written-by-a-guy scenes . I wasn 't believing it for a second . " " Whipped " " is purely a sick male fantasy that 's as flat as it is annoying . I got ( very ) few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy , and those were probably a result of desperation . When you 're not laughing for a long period of time , you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things . So I wouldn 't mark that down as a positive . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is actually a trilogy of 3 of Somerset Maugham 's short tales . The first one is The Verger , which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable . After 17 years Albert Foreman is laid off from his church job because he can 't read nor write . So what does he do ? Opens a tobacco shop , of course ! The second is Mr. Know-All which was actually a story I had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten , until I heard the familiar introduction . Another 15 minute one , and also very good . It worked better on film than in a book for me , but then perhaps that 's because I was only 14 the last time , afterall.The 3rd one is nearly a let-down . Almost an hour in length , it simply drags . It 's not all that bad , but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 . I watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour , and found that it still made sense and really I hadn 't missed a thing !

" I loved this film ! Markie Post is really great in it . I saw it on lifetime , and it 's in the same entertaining class as films like : ' The Betty Broderick Story ' , ' Locked Up : A Mother 's Rage ' , etc .... { which , by the way , are also very good , entertaining films ! } It 's an over the top drama , about a single mother who tries to break away from her middle-class , predictable personality . This movie is just pure entertainment ! It doesn 't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction . But , it does show how any " " regular " " middle class person can ( & they do ! ) get addicted to heroin . Junkies aren 't just homeless uneducated people on the street . { By the way , if you do watch it , check out how the kid bosses his mother around !

" I can 't think of anything , I repeat , ANYTHING positive about this " " Movie " " ! The whole 1 hour 45 minute movie could be shrunken into a short 5-minute movie ! In most scenes , there is absolutely nothing going on and it seems just the camera was left on recording on purpose only to increase the time of the movie ! All you see is someone in the background walking around or watching TV with no specific subject or even talk what so ever ! I just feel I 've wasted 105 minutes of my , my family 's and my friends ' weekend for nothing ! If a movie is poorly made or the scenario isn 't great that 's whole another story , at least it leaves you something to discuss about but about DISTANT , I just have to call it a " " Movie " " because it was motion pictures recorded by a camera.If you haven 't seen it , imagine a 105-min long movie based on two-three lines of story ! What will you end up with ? 5 % of content and 95 % of fillers ! That 's exactly how " " Distant " " was at least for us ! Actors did a great job acting roles that had nothing special in them , they barely talked or showed any special emotions ! I picked up this movie in the comedy section of a store relying on what I read on the back of its cover . I 'm still wondering what was funny in it other than our face after watching the movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've been a devoted IMDB visitor for a few years . This is the movie that finally compelled me to write in a review.I caught this movie by chance ( the opening credits happened to be scrolling past when I turned my TV on one morning ) . I thoroughly enjoyed the film for many reasons , all of which have been well covered by other reviewers -- the moodiness , the forgotten history of the Czech pilots , the subtle charm of the supporting characters , the fatalism of the main characters , and the first person view during the battle scenes.But the element of " " Dark Blue World " " that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects , especially during combat ( and this is a good thing ! ) . While the pilots were flying in battle no musical score accompanied them , no manipulative shots of worried spouses / girlfriends were interwoven , every little aerial maneuver did not elicit trite patriotic cheers , and viewers weren 't asked to swallow unbelievable James Bond-esque pilot heroics . Instead the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy , fear and isolation of these single pilot fighters while they try to stay aloft during combat . As comrades are shot down we are spared tearful howls and the typical ( but audience pleasing ) revenge based heroics . Instead the other pilots sadly and quietly observe their fellow pilot 's fate -- in reality they still need to remain intensely focused on their own safety and objectives at that very moment . We only briefly experience the pilot 's breathing and the background roar of the engines as we , the audience , witness a friend spiral quietly down to his death . And then immediately ' we ' need to jump back into combat mode and focus on survival.Too often in Hollywood we 're spoon-fed the emotions we 're supposed to feel and no room is left for the viewer 's imagination . " " Dark Blue World " " maintains a sparseness that captivates and involves the viewer , allowing us to invest in the movie and fill in the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings.Excellent film , well worth seeing . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch . He 's a modern genius , because he 's not only a film-maker . His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen . So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me , with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets . Still , Lynch is there , and , while this is far from his best , it 's a film not to be missed . Late Richard Farnsworth 's performance is one of the reasons.8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow . At first I thought who writes these things ! How hard is that choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth , respectability and security as opposed to a husband who offers you only oppression , abuse , degradation and poverty . However our choices are not always as clear cut cut as one would think . Indeed the wealthy gentleman was all a woman could aspire to and yet ... the pull of her husband , her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming . What to do , what to do ? ? As a viewer you became as confused and misdirected as she was . Anyway what I really came on this site to gush about was my admiration of the voice of the Engish , I thought , although it is actually the voice of an Irish singer in the film . Looking him up I find he is Glen Hansard , whom I had never heard of before that day . What a find . I am so grateful . Wow , what a voice ! What a day !

" This movie is true action at its finest , It doesn 't get any better then this . This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this . My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells " " I will come in here anytime i like ! ! ! " " and right before he jumps out the window he yells " " Anytime ! ! !

" I channel surfed past this many times , mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy , so " " Love American Style " . " However , it turned out to be quite good , very well done . The two stand-out features are the dialog and acting . Great cast . The premise is actually well executed and there aren 't too many weak moments . I guess what I was most amazed by was how often you thought the wheels are going to come off the cart , and instead , the cart just banks the turns , so to speak , and the movie keeps flying . There are some nice little sub-plots , particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by former Conan sidekick Andy Richter .

" For those too young to remember , or too old to have been part of the " " hype " , " the Michael Jackson fad in the early-to-mid 80 's was at a fever pitch- like the hype about Titanic , except this just didn 't let up . Every song , every video , every word uttered by Michael was important . Nothing similar had been seen since the heyday of the Beatles.I remember seeing this video for the first time , at a roller skating rink . Everyone stopped skating . There was no question as to whether you were a Michael Jackson fan or not ; you were . Everyone crowded around the projection screen , and watched the video ... This is probably one of the longest music videos ever made , and definitely the best . It perpetually gets # 2 on the annual MTV top 100 videos ( # 1 is always the flavor-of-the-month , and somehow whatever was # 1 of all time slips past # 2 , to make way for the new # 1 . Go figure . ) , and Thriller became a phenomenon in and of itself.If you ever get the chance , you must watch the video ; not just the excerpts shown on MTV or VH1 . If necessary , you should search out Making of Thriller at a video rental store . Hey ... your parents probably made you watch Beatles and Woodstock footage because " " it was important " ...

" This is a tepid docu-drama that covers no new ground , reworks all the cliches and is sloppy with facts . For example , Munich is a very flat city . So why is it hilly in the movie ? For example , the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice . Yet it is announced as a surrender . For example , European news vendors did not ( and do not ) shout headlines as they hawk their papers . Yet this strictly American custom is employed in the film . For example , the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until after they had taken power but there it is on the lectern as Hitler delivers one of his stem winders . Indeed , most of this disappointing production consists of little more than Hitlerian oratory . The movie also perpetuates the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched at the Munich Hoffbrauhaus . It was not . Robert Carlyle does a fine portrayal of his subject . But his supporting cast is adequate at best and very often not even that . These comments are based on the first episode only . One only can hope the second will be better but don 't bet on it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Karloff and Lugosi - Together again ! This is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much . It 's not an all-out horror film like the duo 's previous two hits , The Black Cat and The Raven . But , it is very worthy of both 's talents and is a fun film when re-visited.The Invisible Ray was directed by Lambert Hillyer , a director who mainly made westerns , but curiously in these final days of the Laemmles ' reign at Universal , he found himself helming this and the Laemmles ' final horror film , Dracula 's Daughter . Both are crisp , clean-cut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements.Just as Lugosi went wild in The Raven , much needs to be said of Karloff 's hamming in The Invisible Ray . The one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that Karloff 's character , Rukh , acts so madly before he is poisoned by Radium X , that there really isn 't much of a change once he starts glowing . This is very similar to the complaint people have about Jack Nicholson in The Shining - He 's basically a loony right from the start . There isn 't any real transformation . Same here . Halfway through Karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind . I still enjoyed his performance , though , just as I did Lugosi 's over-the-top antics in The Raven.Meanwhile , Lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained , and thoughtful turn as Rukh 's rival in science , Dr. Benet . Lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film , including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch Rukh , of which I am in alignment with horror film writer John Soister on - " " And if he ( Rukh ) touches anyone ? " " the inspector inquires . Lugosi hesitatingly replies , in a way that only Lugosi could deliver , " " They die " . " Just as Lugosi could be so off , he could also be more perfect than any actor . This is one of those moments.Therefore , Karloff and Lugosi 's interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of Karloff pared off against the cool logic of Lugosi . Karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times , however , one wishes Lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one . He only had one more chance ( Ninotchka ) .The Invisible Ray is a fun film , and a real treat to the true Karloff and Lugosi fans . It is one of those films that improves on each viewing , not because it is a masterpiece , but because of the charisma and talent of its ' stars and how this story complements the darker , more horrific pairings they had . The special effects , by the always innovative John Fulton , are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate . Frances Drake looks as beautiful as she did in Mad Love and plays a strong woman , something seldom seen in classic horror films . The scene in the end when Karloff stalks her and she doesn 't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film . A terrific , fun film ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
I really enjoyed the performances of the main cast . Emma Lung is courageous and interesting . The director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional . A complex story with the changing between eras . Also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town . I do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive . There have be many relationships with older men and younger women - without the male being good looking . Depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow . The film has a good look and the cinematography is also good . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What people fail to understand about this movie is that it isn 't a beginning , middle , and end , it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long TV series . So remember that when you all talk about how the world wasn 't explored enough . That was all done in the TV show.As great and stunning as the visuals are , I think the * * * SPOILERS * * * argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo near the end of the film was what really made me love this movie . Seeing characters I had followed through 26 episodes fight like that was agonizing , and seeing Gwizdo walking sadly off by himself amidst the floating ruins while Lian-Chu sharpened his blade was almost tear-jerking . Then we got a total contrast with Lian-Chu fighting these insanely awesome dragons ( Which had been featured before in the series ) while Gwizdo is babbling insanely and indirectly threatening to kill Zoe . * Shudder * I 'm surprised that this particular scene hasn 't been mentioned more in the warnings . Any kid that has a lick of sense will be able to see that Gwizdo wasn 't himself and was fully intent on strangling that little girl . It was enough to bother me , and I 'm 15.The world is amazing , the plot is a lot better than most multi-million blockbusters , and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go . Check it out . : ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film is a bit reminiscent of the German film , THE NEVERENDING STORY because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero . However , due to far superior modern technology , puppets and CGI are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world--one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope.I enjoyed this film , but boy was it a chore at first ! Unfortunately , for most Westerners , this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd . However , give it a chance . Don 't think or try to understand everything you see--just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film.In many ways , this is exactly the sort of advice I 'd give to adults who watch Miyazaki 's SPIRITED AWAY because it is very similar and features tons of Yokai ( Japanese mythical spirits ) . The big differences between the two is that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR is live-action and SPIRITED AWAY is much more child-friendly . While I do think THE GREAT YOKAI WAR was intended mostly as a kids ' movie , in the USA , most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it 's so violent , scary and features some adult behaviors . So who is the audience in the West ? Well , older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-Western themes and composition . This is a rather narrow audience , indeed ! While you are watching , look for all the strange little touches . In fact , you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time . A few of the funny references I liked were the comment about Gamera , the scene that came with the comment " " KIDS : Don 't Try This At Home " " as well as the use of Kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the Yokai ( hmm , ... perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning ) ! By the way , director Takashi Miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically , other than to say that none of his stories I 've seen have seemed " " normal " . " Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and I hated them ( especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER ) whereas some of them are magical and among the best films I 've ever seen ( THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS ) . One thing for sure , it 's hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Following a roughly 7 year rocky road on NBC , it was decided to do just one last Super Installment . The Series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block-buster of a TV hour . It had always had a sizable , hard core of hard corps of followers . It was almost as if the series with the full title of " " HOMICIDE : LIFE ON THE STREET " " ( 1993-99 ) was a sort of " " Mr. In-Between " " of series . It was too big to just cancel , but too small to get a case of ' Rabid Ratings Ravings ' over . During the precarious tenure on Friday evenings , they had presented some of the best and most daringly Artistic of Hourly Dramas . There , I 've said it Artistic , Artistic ! ! But please , remember we mean Artistic , but not just Phony , Pretentious , Pedantic , Politically Correct preaching.When at last , it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for " " HOMICIDE " " ; this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for TV Movie . Looking at all the past seasons ' happenings and parade of regular characters , the Production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off.OUR STORY혚혚혚 . As we join the story , we find that Baltimore Homicide Unit Commanding Officer , Lt. Al Giardello has " " pulled the pin " , " Retired from the job , that is . But ' G ' isn 't ready to really retire-retire yet . So , instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod , we find that Al is running for Mayor of ' Charm City . ' While out in the City , making some campaign stops and speeches , the former Detective Lieutenant takes an assassin 's bullet . Alive , but in a comatose state , he is taken to the Hospital . News spreads quickly and as if officially summoned , we find all of the Detectives of the Baltimore Unit we 've seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance . There is a great meeting of all of these former and present gumshoes as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead.The Producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story . They managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to unrevealed ones . The whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way . But at least for now , we 'll leave that as " " classified " . " In wrapping up everything into a neat , little package , this TV Movie surely gets our endorsement . As for grading " " THE HOMICIDE MOVIE " , " we must give it an A or A + , even . But , no matter the Grade here , it didn 't score as high as a typical weekly episode . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Visual creative epic of inimitable style.This film may neither have the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic acting . But who dares to say this film is no art ? I 'm not a supporter of the idea , that an important film must be serious , non-commercial or bothering me with questions . Even there are a lot of films , apposite to this attributes , that I like.Bogus Journey , for sure , is not one of this films . What you get is pure , excessive creativity with a very positive charged , childlike energy . This film doesn 't reflect reality . Its friendly-naive and utopian . Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me it would be a pretty nice time-place combination to live in ! Except of that music ; - ) Technically , Bogus Jorney is very well made . I always liked the cinematography and the sceneries of this movie . Especially in this point Bogus Journey tops its prequel by far . Also the effects are good , and I think most of them very made without cgi . I generally prefer the good old effects in big budget movies . Sure its ' just another Hollywood movie ' out of some peoples view . But I think it is this in a very charismatic way.A short word to the soundtrack : all the band and orchestral music fits very well into the film . Also the sound design has no lack . I am not a big fan of rock music , but I had to get this track by Winger from the scene ' station ' builds the bill and ted robots in the van . I love the unorthodox camera work at its beginning.Let me conclude saying this : This film is very naive and very imaginative ! It is way better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin , The Godfather , Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of god . It is absolutely superior to citizen kane , apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil ... ... it is even better than Total Recall ... No way ! ? Yes way ! Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey is simply the best movie ever made.Who dares to disagree makes himself guilty of " " artsie-fartsy behavior " " or likes Terminator Salvation ( what is the bigger self-defamation ) PS : part 1 is not the better movie . So Bogus Jorney is a superior sequel . Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel ! Its NOT ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Penny Princess finds American working girl Yolande Donlon the inheritor of a small kingdom that lies in that triangle where France , Italy , and Switzerland meet called Lampidorra . It seems as though the Lampidorrans owe bills all over Europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggling due to its geography . An American multi-millionaire buys the place , but dies before he can take title . His nearest heir is Donlan.But of course the estate has to go through probate in America and what are the Lampidorrans to do ? Especially since Donlan who has now become a princess has forbade smuggling.Enter Dirk Bogarde who is on a trip to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry . It seems as though the Lampidorrans have a kind of cheese that they playfully refer to as Schmeeze . With a few bumps in the road , Schmeeze solves all the problems both financial , geopolitical , and romantic between Donlan and Bogarde.How does Schmeeze work , well that 's the gimmick to the whole film . But here 's a hint . In Lover Come Back Jack Kruschen might just have gotten a hold of the secret of Schmeeze when he was busy inventing VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency.Anyway Penny Princess is a delightful blend of British farce and romantic comedy . Yolande Donlon once again plays a role that Marilyn Monroe would have been cast in if the film had been made this side of the pond . Dirk Bogarde was well cast in the part which was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart throb , way before anyone but him suspected he had the acting chops he had.This film was sadly shown at three o 'clock in the morning on TCM .

" This one 's a romp ; many Trek fans don 't rate this as high as the well-known all-time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones , but this one is so well executed for what it is , so successful as pure entertainment , it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes , no matter what mood I 'm in . Several well known future movies ( " " Westworld " " ) and TV shows ( the more bland " " Fantasy Island " " ) took their cue from the premise of this episode ( then , of course , the TNG show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology ) . Beautifully filmed ( especially evident in the restored version and on DVD ) and directed , it takes place in the nice park-like setting of a planet which the Enterprise has just arrived to . It 's odd that no animal life , even insects , seems to exist here ( how are flowers pollinated , for example ) , but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past ( Kirk has a people-heavy past , it turns out ) , as well as figures from other well-known fantasy stories . Sulu even finds an old-style police revolver ( adding to his collection of swords , no doubt ) .By this point in the Trek series ( halfway thru the first season ) , the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we 'd come to know over the many proceeding years . Here , we get to really see them relax , converse and work together to figure out this episode 's puzzle : the strong narrative is a mystery again , of sorts , and the audience is along for the ride as Kirk & friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them . It 's almost whimsical , following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as Kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue ( the Enterprise had , it 's suggested , just completed a harrowing mission ) . Then Dr. McCoy is killed by a knight on horseback ; yes , this is Dr. McCoy 's final episode ... just kidding . But , it 's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story . McCoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and , like the best Trek episodes , the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic , more desperate tempo of action and suspense . This is all signaled by Kirk 's resolute response to Sulu , who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after McCoy 's death - Kirk will get to the bottom of all this , come what may.But , it doesn 't get much easier for Kirk : what follows is probably the longest staged mano-a-mano fight for the series as Kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days , a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet . Yet , this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness , with another of Kirk 's past acquaintances . This episode runs the gamut of all human experience , rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet . It 's gratifying that the script really does explain all of what 's happened , as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy & sci-fi series with similar plot lines ( unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there ) . And there actually is a subtext to the story - that we humans need to ' work ' off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion , or we just don 't function in a ' normal ' natural way . Also , note the appearance of the very cute Yeoman Barrows and the sudden absence of Yeoman Rand , who did not return until the first Trek movie in ' 79 . I believe that after this episode , even more Trek fans couldn 't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters . But I leave this episode with a final , perhaps tantalizing thought : if McCoy was killed ( verified by Spock ) , how do we know it was our real McCoy who beamed back up to the ship ? Perhaps this explains why this McCoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with Data . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types : the quiet , introspective , usually romantic study and the farcical social satire . Settings , characters , and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories . Butterflies is perhaps the epitom챕 of the first type . The scripts are very verbal , including long interior monologues by the main character Ria , a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life . When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman ( who makes his interest in her quite clear ) , she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered.The acting and scripts are always on the money , which makes one 's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one : I was neither blown away by it nor turned off . My mother , on the other hand , adored this show . I think the degree to which one identifies with Ria 's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one 's reaction to Butterflies . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies . The voyeuristic element during the scenes ( Santa & Pedro summarize society 's behavior peering through a telescope ) is unique ( and obviously Jean-Luc Godard , although he was subtle , stole this theme in his film " " Pierrot le-fou " " ) .

" You like to solve mysteries ? You like complex narrations ? This is for you . Brilliant , clever movie by Francis Leclerc ( son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc ) . Flashy photo and clever editing is the word of Leclerc , strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who 's dythirambic in the lead role.The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur , veterinary in his 40 's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown . Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer 's sufferings on the road . Throughout the struggling , he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him.Not spooky , but very mysterious and well played movie . I have my hypothesis on the ending ( I think the Indian caused the accident ) but this ending was open to any explanations.I strongly recommend it 9.5 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" An untidy man , known as Bill , lives in a small dreary flat , with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall , and his typewriter for company . Only the man can 't think of anything to write . He wanders around the streets following people , just to see where they go . Maybe this will give him some inspiration to write . He begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag . He follows him for a few days . While in a cafe , the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill , and inquires why Bill is following him . The well dressed man says his name is Cobb . Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that he is a burglar , and even starts to take Bill with him into houses to steal things ; although Cobb insists he doesn 't go into other people 's homes to just steal . He says he likes to let people know he has been there , and interrupted the things they take for granted . He puts knickers from another burglary into a man 's trousers , for example.The film is told in flashbacks at times too . The director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature Memento . Bill eventually decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit , on the advice of Cobb . He meets a Blonde lady in a club , who used to date the owner , a bald man , who is very dangerous , she says . We see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man 's hence men on a man 's fingers in the Blonde lady 's flat . These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us , and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I claim no matter how hard I seek I 'll never find a better movie version of " " Othello " . " If you love Kenneth Branagh 's magnificent masterpieces " " Much ado about nothing " " ( 1993 ) and " " Hamlet " " ( 1996 ) as much as I do I 'm dead certain you 'll also find Oliver Parker 's " " Othello " " irresistible . Laurence Fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career . He was quite terrific in " " Boys n the hood " " ( 1991 ) - I 've always considered his amusing role of Furious Styles as his very greatest achievement . That was , of course , way before I saw this.He plays the part of Othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant , fantastic job . Ir챔ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story 's crooked , manipulate villain Iago . Marvelous " " Othello " " is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeare 's ingenious works . It deals with his favorite topics : crookedness , envy , deceitfulness and jealousy . This movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films I 've seen that 's based on William Shakespeare 's plays . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Once a year " " comes " " a movie like that and makes things easy for you . You don 't have make an effort to think it is good , it 's just is . You enjoy it while you watch it , and you take it home with you . I can 't say it is totally flawless , but it 's near . Acting - great , story -interesting and with elements of suspense . It 's a small family story , pretty much predictable , but it 's not the secret itself that matters. it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it . I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship ( the blind girl and her cousin ) . The only thing I didn 't like that much is the actress that played the mother , she was too tough and without necessity . Keren , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this movie with my mother , and I loved it ! It was such a sweet story , ( Not to mention funny because of the supporting cast ! ) They never make movies like this ... ever ! My favorite part is when Grace ( Minnie Driver ) finds out about her boyfriend 's wife 's death , and that she has the deceased wife 's heart and she screams , " " WHAT WAS GOD THINKING ? " " I do believe everyone ( No matter who you believe in ) has thoughts like that once in awhile . But while it 's very sappy , it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for all . ( Sigh ) The comedic timing between Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi will just make you crack up ( especially in the aforementioned scene , it 's terrible , and yet so funny ! ) . They make a good pair , and I hope to see them again in something soon . 10 / 10 Stars , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " Pharaoh 's Army " " defies formula . Instead of selling out for cliches and big stars , it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast , the strength of a well written script , and a fascinating and bitter story . The result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast , with a heavy emotional current . One of the best I 've ever seen about the Civil War , and I think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film ( if you like this film , try to see the similarly brilliant indie Civil War film " " Wicked Spring " " as well ) . " " Pharaoh " " simply tells the true story of a small expedition / forage team of Union men who ride into a Confederate farm to take provisions , but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men . Tensions broil and relationships are made and broken . Nothing happens the way Hollywood would write it ; this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history . Superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional , but often doesn 't feel like you 're watching a movie , more along the lines of hearing a story.The film boasts an incredible performance from Chris Cooper who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role . He transforms , but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to . Patricia Clarkson is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in . She shares an interesting chemistry with Cooper 's character and where she 's the more severe of the characters , is still as easy to identify with . The rest of the cast is quite capable , and fill their roles in well.The art design and the set are wonderful , and personally I love the cinematography . It all has the feel of a Civil War period photograph with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin-like metalic tint , but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting . They seem to have used natural lighting , but whatever they used works beautifully . Everything looks like it belongs where it is , it feels period , something I find rare in American period films . The actors act 19th century , not like 20th century people in old clothes.Above all , this film is very personal . I think that as an indie it can afford it . The film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation , as bad as it is . It doesn 't fail in getting it 's point across , and it gets it 's point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films these days . It 's brave . It relies on it 's characters , a fantastic script , human emotion , and in the cold hard fact that the Civil War wasn 't all CGI , big stars , and hoop skirts . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Pretend it 's not happening : when the Monkees commit group suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge ! Take drugs - take a lot of drugs : take as many drugs as the cast and crew evidently did while making this film ! With Head , the Monkees revealed themselves as the angriest , snottiest entertainers in Hollywood history , bar none . It is bewildering to discover that they blamed the failure of this film on bad promo . To be sure , the promotion was virtually non-existent ; but did they not recognize how angry , how down-right depressing , how self-destructive this film actually is ? ! I mean , this film is a trip - on bad acid - to the suicide ward of a mental hospital . The only film I know to be this depressing is Terry Gilliam 's Brazil ; and like Brazil , this film reveals why life in the later 20th Century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky . It 's not simply that Western culture was suffering from serious information-overload , but the information itself was just bad , bad , more bad , and dismal . In fact , it was the overload effect itself that kept people going , since this allowed people to keep distracting themselves with one crisis or another - if news from Vietnam became too much to bear , they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rising unemployment rate.The " " positive " " response to the reality revealed in Head was Woodstock - three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid and Peter Townsend almost killing Abbie Hoffman . All taking place behind a steel fence , under the lovingly watchful eyes of a veritable army of NY State Troopers - meaning that the " " freedom " " of Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the song John Sebastion thought he was singing while so strung out he could barely speak . " " 500,000 assholes too stupid to come in out of the rain , " " was one critic 's judgment on Woodstock ( I think it was Andy Warhol ) . The one good thing occurring there was Jimi Hendrix 's Star Spangled Banner . Two years previously , the Jimi Hendrix Experience had gone on their first National tour of America , as the warm-up band opening for - the Monkees . See , it 's all connected somehow.You owe it to yourself - nay , you owe it to your unborn children - to see the real 1960s , only to be found on film in this bizarre , miraculous , and utterly absurd tribute to one of the more interesting capitalist scams of the later 20th Century . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This isn 't far away from the trash that Bollywood normally makes but there 's just something really good about it.The title song is one of Bollywoods best and is haunting throughout . This is one of the films ( along with Baazigar - a must see Bollywood film ) that made Shah Rukh Khan and it 's for this you have to check it out.Other reviews give away the story - it is a fairly basic idea - ShaRukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra star.Its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to Bollywood or not ! 8 / 10 , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Michael Ritchie 's " " The Couch Trip " " is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist . It is so subtle and wicked that you start to realize what a stinging satire it really is . It is also Dan Akyroyd 's best movie , made in a particularly great film year ( 1988 ) for him . First , " " The Great Outdoors " " and now this.Akyroyd stars as John Burns , a career crook who fakes insanity to escape prison . Now , a dumb comedy would just be about this . But " " The Couch Trip " " uses this as a springboard for everything else . Beverly Hills psychiatrist George Maitlin ( Charles Grodin , subtly hilarious here ) has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected : Lawrence Baird , who happens to be Akyroyd 's psychiatrist ! You can pretty much guess what 's going to happen , but the great thing about " " The Couch Trip " " is not what happens , but how it is done . " " The Couch Trip " " gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had . His John Burns is one of the truly original comic creations in movie history . Wicked one liners and physical humor are a part of it , but what makes it special is that Akyroyd makes Burns a lovable character . We root for him and grow to like him a whole lot during the 98 minute running time.But Akyroyd isn 't alone here . He gets strong support from other great comic actors . Walter Matthau joins the hilarity as a con artist minister who catches on to Burns ' secret and commits genteel blackmail . Charles Grodin " " slow burns " " his way to another great comic role as the burned out psychiatrist . Grodin has been one of the most underappreciated actors in Hollywood . It 's criminal they haven 't used him more often . Richard Romanus plays Grodin 's slimeball lawyer to perfection .

MGM spent a fortune buying the Orion library but have yet to truly cash in on their acquisition . " " The Couch Trip " " joins " " Dressed to Kill " , " " " Blow Out " " and countless others in gathering dust rotting in the vault . Shame on MGM for their inaction .

" John Huston finished his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies I 've ever seen . For his farewell he decided to adapt James Joyce 's beautiful short story , " " The Dead " , " and made not only one of the most faithful literature-to-film adaptations yet , he also crafted a movie that more than 20 years later still surpasses a lot of contemporary cinema.When I watched this movie a few years ago , as a student at University , I gazed in awe at the screen , marvelling at every aspect of the movie : acting , screen writing , direction , costumes , settings , music , cinematography . Thinking about it now , I still can 't of anything I 'd criticise it for . Huston just knew how to tell a good story.A good deal of credit should also go to Tony Huston . He knew better than to meddle with a text that is not only perfection itself but already visual enough for cinema . Father and son let the story breathe and relish in the long , fascinating conversations between characters , and in the meaningful silences.Donal McCann also deserves credit for the his performance as Gabriel Conroy . I had never seen him in movies before , nor have I seen him afterwards , but he gave one of the most moving performances I 've ever seen.All in all , The Dead is a fine cinematic experience , from a legendary director who never stopped being excellent . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

While the general theme is the same : wealthy man meets and learns to love a poor working class woman , the characters of Romuald and Juliette are much more lovable and worthy of our time with them . I have never forgotten them and consider the movie superior to Pretty woman in so many ways . Juliette is a remarkable woman and the clever ways she helps her boss overcome his problems will make you cheer . The final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy .

" I couldn 't agree more with Nomad 7 's and I A HVR 's comments . A perfect laid back Sunday morning movie . The humor is subtle ( exact opposite of " " slapstick " " as one misguided commenter noted ) .But what always ceases to amaze me is how often I find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over . I originally copied this movie onto VHS about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those Pay Cable free weekend previews ( HBO maybe ? ) . Had never heard of it previously . Don 't know why it wasn 't marketed that well . ? ? When DVD 's were released en mass , it was one of the first movies I replaced . A great combination of cast and writing . Plus , the back drop of Montana wilderness doesn 't hurt things either ( beautiful ) .It 's probably not the type of comedy for everyone , but what is ? If Adam Sandler type stuff is up your alley , this probably won 't be your cup of tea . This movie needs your full attention . The humor is mostly in the dialog.I believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th .

" Some films are designed to just entertain you , others to make you laugh , or cry , or uplift , others , like this , aim to provoke , to make you think , and to make you angry . I was angry during this film , not at the film , but at the fact that it was true , that America , the free , does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good . The torture scenes in this movie were harrowing , the indifference of people was shattering , the film was compelling in its argument , and showed just how wrong it is to torture people . Of course now that makes me a " " bleeding liberal " " labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not . People who don 't realise that as the movie said , for every person tortured , you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance . You get an ever increasing cycle of violence . This film did not make me hate America , although I can see how it could do , but it made me hate the way that America has reacted in its post 9 / 11 world . There is a significant quote in the film , just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene , the quote is " " one American is dead " " - that makes the difference . You cannot kill an American , America can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single American , or they will do whatever it takes , including torture to enact justice . This is the American way apparently . Call me a liberal , call me naive ( although I think the people who think torture is fine are naive ) call me deluded , call me anything you like , but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in America and the west today . I wish this film would be shown to all school students , at a minimum . This film will stay with me a long time , part of me wishes I could forget it , because I wish this type of thing never happened , but I know it does , the other part of me wishes I would never forget , because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again . Whatever happens to me , this film will be with me for a long time , and I will be telling everyone I know to watch it , not to be entertained , but to be provoked , because sometimes we all need to be provoked . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do . It bridged the gap between the silly , manufactured , Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult , musically growing and evolving , and yet still a little silly Monkees of the ' 70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith 's , " " If they think we are plastic now , wait till they see how we do it . " " That the Monkees were tired of all of the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record . They said it over and over in interviews . They needed to re-make themselves , and what better way that to de-bunk and hilariously lampoon the very machine that created them . And at the same time , they commented on our whole society ( news , movies , art , everything ) and said , " " Hey , why pick on us - isn 't all of this stuff manufactured on one point or another . " " These are the Orwellian " " proles " " ( the Monkees represented the persecuted " " everyman " " even at their silliest in the TV series ) pulling down " " Big Brother 's " " pants and kicking him in his very deserving butt.Loved the ideas , loved the music , loved the effects , loved the movie !

" The spoiler warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and landscapes pass before their eyes , although I don 't mention it in great detail . " " Earth " " is an approx . 90 minute cinema version based on " " Planet earth " " which I watched all on BBC TV.The TV version was narrated by David Attenborough , a captivating commentator , who I had wished had also done it for " " Earth " " but it is Patrick Stewart , Star Trek 's Captain Picard . There are regularly shots of the Earth from space so that 's may be appropriate . In any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it . There are 12 chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from North Pole to Antarctica . 3 animal families , polar bear , elephant and whale , appear in more than one of these parts . Each " " chapter " " starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is . We see something of each kind of animal , but only mammals and birds , and some fish , and some beautiful shots of vegetation , mountains , waterfalls , deserts and jungle , a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and climates on earth . You get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals : people or villages or cities aren 't in the film , so it 's a typical nature documentary , but breathtakingly shot and accompanied by delightful music . When the film opened I already knew it would end far too soon for me . It is a family film , so no brutal killings of any animals . When one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it 's shot in slow-motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children ( age limit 6 in The Netherlands ) . No blood is shed . Some scenes ( newly born animals ) are really cute and will be adored by kids . It looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took ( 4000 ) and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty . It had it 's Dutch premiere yesterday , a month before the actual release , in a cinema of 500 seats , of which 15 were taken . True beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers , it seems . As I knew the TV-series I was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie . Some didn 't , but the most impressive shots ( big waterfalls ) did , luckily . It was the first time I ever cried in a nature film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Rather nasty piece of business featuring Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist ( with yes , a Renfield-like assistant and his mother , a dwarf and yes , the scientist 's wife ( sounds like a Greenaway movie actually lol ) . Lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides ( why them ? Who knows ? ) so that his wife can keep looking beautiful . He gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar . After another bride bites the dust , a newspaper reporter just HAPPENS to be around for the scoop , and decides to snoop around for a story . She gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and Lugosi . Heaven knows where the police were . Soon she 's off to Bela 's lair , when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil . It all cumulates in a totally far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist , but it seems that the scientist has x-ray vision , as he foils her plans , Oh no ! What will happen ? I actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure . Lugosi is great here , his hangers-on are all very very strange , the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable .

" My wife wanted to see this movie and I grudgingly went along . I have never been a big fan of the biopic - believing that cinema is more exciting when it isn 't structured in non-fiction . Beyond that , although I like Ray Charles ' music just fine , I don 't consider myself a fan of him or his music.I expected to either suffer or coast through this movie.I was wrong.This is an engaging story told in a classic cinematic style . The realism is in the nuances - the tilt of a character 's head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes while they sing . I literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it.Jaime Foxx , of which much has been said , heads a cast of immaculate re-creators of not just a time , but an ERA , a LIFE that never really existed to those of us under forty . This movie sinks the audience into time without the gimmicks and grand sweeping panoramas of Titanic or other period pieces of that ilk . This movie doesn 't present you with the 50 's and 60 's music scene , it takes you there.This is a movie about Ray Charles , but your appreciate of it should not be limited to the story of his life . This is the kind of movie , like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler 's List , that does what a movie should do - bring you to another place , another time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Tiny Toons is the first cartoon I remember watching as a child and I loved every minute of it . When I was four or five my parents purchased the video How I Spent My Vacation . I watched it over and over again until I new every word . Well a few days ago my three year old cousin came over and I had to entertain him . I decided to show him this old relic of my childhood . I new he would laugh but I was surprised how much I laughed . Like every Tiny Toons film and episode the humor is based more on wackiness and slapstick humor and succeeds tremendously . Bugs , Babs , Plucky Duck , Maton Pig , and Fifi all endure amazing adventures from Bugs and Babs white-water rafting with a little help from Superman , Plucky Duck and Maton pig travel to the greatest amusement park only to ride the monorail , and Elmyra goes on an odd quest to find cute kittens in a safari land.Some of the classic humor stands in this Tiny Toon Adventure and is some of the best wacky comedy I 've ever seen . My favorite gag had to be the monorail thing when Hamton and Plucky arrive , ride the monorail , and leave ) much to Plucky 's dismay ) . No matter what your age you 'll laugh yourself to tears while not having to deal with language and nudity.Tiny Toons Adventures : How I Spent My Vacation .

" I never fail to be amazed and horrified by the evil that has been predicated in the history of the world in the name of religion , and it seems that the machinations of the Catholic Church in Twentieth Century Ireland rank right up there near the top - considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some sobering effect.A Love Divided is the story of a real family scarred by ignorant intolerance and prejudice all in the name of an inane Church doctrine . At the beginning of the film , we are offered a view of the bucolic life in a small Irish village in which Sheila and Sean Cloney are happily married with two young children . Sean is Catholic and Sheila is Protestant , but she has no qualms with their children being raised as Catholic . There is no sign of any animosity between the Catholics and Protestants in the village . The peaceful and loving relationships are soon shattered when Sheila expresses the desire to have their older child attend the Protestant school . The local priest takes it upon himself to forbid this " " sin " " and soon has Sheila 's husband and the entire Catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father , the local dairy farmer . In an act of defiance and desperation , Sheila kidnaps her two daughters and flees from the area.Special note should be given to Orla Brady who plays Sheila . She gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn in to the emotional trauma in which she decides to reject the wishes of a husband she deeply loves in order to express her fervent desire to establish herself as independent from the pressures of the establishment . On an equal footing is Liam Cunningham who plays Sean for he gives a realistic portrait of a man not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between his love for her and the influence of Church and community.If fiction , this film would have been a compelling and interesting drama . Considering it is true , it changes to a horrific tragedy . In real life , the people and the village never fully recovered from the events that took place there . It took almost half a century for the Church to acknowledge its negative role in the events , and even though Sheila and Sean lived out their lives in the area , they never fully recovered from what was done to them by the religious leaders and their fellow villagers.Whether it be denying basic rights to education of choice , crashing planes into buildings , subjugating women , condemning whole races , or just plain on torture and murder , we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I usually have a difficult time watching a TV movie , the extra long commercial breaks will break my concentration and I give up and find a good book . This one however made me put up with the adds and stay with it to the end . I realize the movie was based on a true story but it was not brought out why it took so long to find Denny ? They had his name and I would presume his social security number . While he did move around a lot it would seem he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job etc .

" I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece . I 'd recommend to buy this movie on DVD because it 's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once . And trust me , you 'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times.The characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced , no black and white . Even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists , there is also empathy for the other characters.I think the IMDb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Masks " " is a moving film that works on many levels . At its simplest , it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art ( masks ) to the next generation . Although , at times the story makes the old man into a Job , it is so well crafted ( written , acted , directed , wonderful production values ) , it is easy to move beyond his plight . And , if you hang with it , the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting . Kudos all around . This is a wonderful film for children as well as adults . The trick is how to get Americans who may not like foreign language films to see it ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent I have sat through many movies that don 't particularly hold my interest , but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children . Parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children 's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children 's movies . Disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name.Technically , the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over-dubbed and unnatural . Personally I hate that , but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project . The " " acting " " reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices . Thankfully it was a very short movie.Now , before I come off like a video-geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick , the one thing that can save even the worst children 's movie is a positive message . Far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is . Let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given : If you are lost , don 't worry , you will inevitably find your way home.Approach wild animals without any fear.You can win any competition just because you " " know " " you can.and my favorite , the final message left in the film : It 's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre , Sergio Martino . Fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by Ernesto Gestaldi , this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film . It 's when everything has fallen into place that we can go , " " Ahh .. " " The film revolves around the death of a husband ( .. in an airplane explosion ) and the million dollars the wife receives from it . There are those with great interest in that money , one in particular being the dead man 's mistress . The wife is Lisa ( Ida Galli ) and the mistress demanding half the money is Lara ( Janine Reynaud ) . She tells Lisa she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money . Lara says she 'll use her " " lawyer " , " Sharif ( Luis Barboo ) to get that money . So already , the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of Lisa , who awaiting someone in Tokyo . George Hilton portrays Peter Lynch . Peter works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means . When , on his watch , Lisa is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room , he is a possible suspect . He decides to do a little investigating himself , while also assisting Inspector Stavros ( Luigi Pistilli ) and Interpol agent , Benton ( Tom Felleghy ) on their quest to find a killer . The killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of Lisa . Soon , the film follows a journalist , Cl챕o Dupont ( the delicious , luscious Anita Strindberg ) as she and Peter meet for a dinner where she could try and sniff out anything that might break a story for her . Soon they fall deeply in love , but it seems like anyone who is near Peter is killed . Soon someone attacks Cl챕o with an intent to kill which pushes the investigation further into uncharted territory . Why would anyone wish to harm a journalist with no real facts to damage the one killing off people.This giallo is quite clever and exciting to follow . The film never lulls which is quite remarkable since so much happens leaving open the question of the identity of the killer . This film follows the path of gialli with knife slashings because of a certain pattern the killer has taken ( the throat and lower torso ) . The film 's conclusion wraps up all the complex loose ends and is quite satisfying . The film has some unique camera angles , but delivers the goods in terms of driving the plot and the execution of the mystery . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor . Telling from my first sentence I don 't like that humor and this movie had it 's moments but I loved it . Justin Long has really never done comedy like this , where he 's sarcastic and clever and I loved it . Lewis Black .... enough said . The ending I really did love because It had to take itself seriously I mean how else would you end it ? Yes it 's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn 't their ups and downs , it was people coming together for one common goal , To go to college where they were accepted . The cast was amazing and yes I did laugh at loud when I didn 't think I would and the laughter lasted longer then I thought to . The parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary . The movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to . They played in to the story very well , and I loved the familiar faces Anthony Heald ( Boston Public ) , Jeremy Howard ( I ) ( Galaxy Quest with Justin Long ) Ross Patterson ( The New Guy ) and Sam Horrigan ( Brink ) . Blake Lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable , as well as B 's Friends . I recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line ! ~ ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * May be spoilers * No doubt one of the best dramas if not the best in the genre I 've ever seen . Is Prot an alien or just a crazy bugger ? This is the question you 'll be asking yourself all throughout the movie . Kevin Spacey is simply amazing , as is Jeff Bridges . You can 't beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times .

" This film is one that played very well back in 1932 and probably wouldn 't work as well today because its style it a bit old fashioned and contrived . However , if you are the sort person , like me , who adores older Hollywood films , you cut the film a bit of slack and can enjoy it for what it is--an interesting soap.The film is set in a ward for problem pregnancies . In this large room are about a half dozen beds in which women are waiting to give birth--but doctors are concerned about possible complications ( yikes--such a room would really traumatize the mothers ! ) . And , like an episode of " " Love Boat " " or " " Fantasy Island " , " each mother has her own special story . With so many rather extreme and crazy stories , you have to suspend disbelief . I could and enjoyed the film quite a bit.Here are a few of the stories : One involves a father . You don 't see the mom , but he is a very , very nervous father and it 's included for comic relief . However , he was wonderful here--very touching.Loretta Young and Eric Linden are a sad case . Loretta is sent to the hospital from prison--she apparently killed some horrible guy . You don 't know exactly what occurred , but you assume he was trying to force himself on her ! Yet , she was given a 20 year sentence--and her husband is devoted to her and is by her side as much as he can.Glenda Farrell is an awful person . She has the maternal instincts of a hamster--a really , really bad and alcoholic hamster ! She is pretty funny and worth seeing through most of the film . I loved her drinking from a hot water bottle filled with gin as well as becoming upset when she learns she can 't make money selling her twins ! ! Late in the film , she has a typical Hollywood-style change of heart that was supposed to be touching--I found it contrived.There is a woman who has given birth to a still-born baby . Amazingly , afterwords , they put the lady back in the same ward as the women waiting to give birth ! ! ! A crazy woman , who you assumed lost a baby some time ago , wanders down from the psychiatric unit . She insists she 's having a baby . Later , she escapes again and actually takes one of the kids ! There are most stories than this but the ones I mentioned are the main ones . As I said , it 's a soap opera of sorts and is highly entertaining--and quite sad in the case of several of the stories . The ending , in particular , is heart-breaking and exceptionally well done . There were a few particularly good performances--especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as the head nurse . All in all , a very good film--and I have no idea why they felt they had to remake the film just a few years later ( which was typical for Warner Brothers ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" when I know that Walter will never grace another set.I was in my 30 's when I first saw this sweet , endearing and unabashedly romantic film.I loved it from the first scene , and all the way through to the end.Art Carney was his usual daft self ; Glenda matched Walter step for step in the witticisms ; and Richard Benjamin supplied the sarcastic voice of reason that he does so well.Along the way there were many actors whom we all recognize , doing their usual brilliance . There are a couple of lines in the movie which my SO and I have used throughout the years , but I won 't say anything about them here.I 'm pretty sure you will know which two I am talking about . Just get this movie.Make some popcorn , grab your squeeze ( if he is as sappy as mine is , for which I am thankful ) , and enjoy this standout romantic comedy from the 70 's . You will not be disappointed . However , I have the feeling that I am preaching to the choir here because anyone who loves Walter will already own it.I 'm very glad it 's out on DVD now , finally . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have not read the novel , or anything other by Kurt Vonnegut , but I am now intending to start . This grips you from the very first frame , and does not let go until the end credits start rolling . Taking you places you don 't expect , the plot is interesting throughout . The pacing is spot-on , nothing lasts too long , and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we 've seen . It is well-told and well-thought out . I 've never watched a film that I feel I could particularly compare this to . It is intense and exciting , as well as funny and sad . The acting is excellent , Nolte absolutely shines , Goodman again proves that he doesn 't have to go for laughs , and Lee and Arkin are spellbinding . I could go on , really ... no role is treated to a less than stellar performance . The editing and cinematography are marvelous , and all of the visuals are great , with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones . I am going to go for other movies directed by Keith Gordon , as well as the other two apparently related to this , through the author of the books . There is one scene of sexuality , and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this . I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it ; it is not pleasant . 8 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Murder in Mesopotamia , I have always considered one of the better Poirot books , as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending . There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking , with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score . As always David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot , the comedic highlight of the episode being Poirot 's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night , and Hugh Fraser is good as the rather naive Captain Hastings . The remainder of the cast turn in decent performances , but are careful not to overshadow the two leads , a danger in some Christie adaptations . Some of the episode was quite creepy , a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs , an episode that I enjoyed a lot more than this one . What made it creepy in particular , putting aside the music was when Louise Leidner sees the ghostly face through the window . About the adaptation , it was fairly faithful to the book , but I will say that there were three things I didn 't like . The main problem was the pacing , it is rather slow , and there are some scenes where very little happens . I didn 't like the fact also that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer . In the book , I see him as a rather nervous character , but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer , and under-developing that , made him a less appealing character , though I am glad they didn 't miss his drug addiction . ( I also noticed that the writers left out the fact that Mrs Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer 's next victim . ) The other thing that wasn 't so impressive was that I felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of Amy Leatheran , like it was in the book , Amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation . On the whole , despite some misjudgements on the writers ' behalf , I liked Murder in Mesopotamia . 7 / 10 Bethany Cox . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Based on the idea from Gackt , Moon Child took place in a poverty-stricken country called Mallepa . In a futuristic timeline , the story followed the lives of the two main characters , Kei ( HYDE ) and Sho ( Gackt ) and their friends growing up together.Despite some actions might be overly done or perhaps humorous , I strongly believed that this is a movie about friendship . Even amongst all the hardships between each character , in the end , each of them wanted to have someone on their side , to have friends.Unlike most vampire characters , Kei portrayed a vampire that loathed the idea of having to kill in order to live . A vampire found friendship in the hand of a young boy , Sho who 's not afraid of Kei . Regardless of what some might 've thought , I see Kei as a fatherly figure to Sho . Kei was there throughout the earlier life of Sho , he took care of him , and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs controls their lives . On the other hand , Sho who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man , he grew up to be a man who realised that life isn 't all about fun and games , that death exists and able to take away his loved ones.I love the part where Lee Hom , the actor who played Son , first appeared on the screen . The way they met up was quite cool indeed . Son also has a big part within this movie , the fact that he 's from a different race , a Taiwanese , made quite an impact to the friendship theme within the movie . The way how friendships were developed despite background differences was portrayed excellently in this movie.I believed that each actor did a great job considering that this was their first time to appear in such big screen movie . Both HYDE and Gackt managed to act quite well and created quite believable characters . Unlike movies that had musician turned actors and filled the movie with songs , they 've done great acting jobs ! Moon Child really made an impact for me , it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration , that we have to appreciate every friendship in our lifetimes . The movie shows a lot of hope , despite all the bad things that happen in their lives , that there 's always hope . Life can be cruel , that it seems hope doesn 't exist anymore . It also shows a very strong sense of friendships between each other , even when Son became the enemy , Sho did have some sort of " " fun " " at their last battle . Every single one of them desired peace in the end , no matter how far apart they 've become . The ending scene showed it to us . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" 1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time : TERMINATOR 2 : JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY . Out of the two , I 've always liked BILL & TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY a bit better . TERMINATOR 2 : JUDGMENT DAY is the better made , but there 's just nothing like Bill and Ted . Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY , it 's hard to think of a greater comedic duo than Bill and Ted . They are one of a kind.Seemingly influenced by National Lampoon 's O.C. and Stiggs , Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson , two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in L.A. back in the 1980s . The two quickly began writing a screenplay about two and before long BILL & TED 'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born . The film , shot in 1987 and released in 1989 , became a big box office success and an instant cult classic . It wasn 't long before work began on the sequel . Stephen Herek , the director of ' EXCELLENT ADVENTURE ' wasn 't keen on working on the sequel since he considered it to be too mean-spirited and unlike the first one so Peter Hewitt , making his feature film debut , was brought in to direct the sequel . There couldn 't have been a better director for the job . BILL & TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY is marvelously directed . It 's filled with its own unique style and energy that can 't be matched.What makes ' BOGUS JOURNEY ' one of the best sequels ever is that it while it is darker than the original , it is just as fun . It doesn 't change the characters like most sequels do . Bill and Ted are the same lovable characters that they were in the first film . This is because it was written by the original writers . Most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one , but since ' BOGUS JOURNEY ' had the same screenwriters , it ended up being just as good as ' EXCELLENT ADVENTURE ' if not even better . Just like the first one , ' BOGUS JOURNEY ' is absolutely hilarious , well written , fun , and above all , original . It 's filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from Alex Winter , Keanu Reeves , and William Sadler . It 's an unforgettable ' journey ' . 10 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Just saw this film the other day at the Santa Fe Film Festival . I was delighted by its honesty and humor . It was the most thought provoking movie I 've seen in a very long time -- I just can 't get it off of my mind for some reason . It may not be for everyone , because it makes you think . I don 't know if people like to think in movies so much anymore , which is a shame . The actors who play the Franklins are quite a find . I couldn 't imagine playing these complicated people with such frankness . Though I thought a couple of the supporting characters were not as good as the Franklins , I can totally forgive it -- because this is an important movie in my opinion .

But after watching this program , I surely wish I had.This documentary is a guide to the ' Holy Grail of Physics ' - the quest to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe into one ' master equation ' that eluded Einstein during the last years of his life . Brian Green , a professor at Columbia University , introduces us to this mind blowing theory in a wonderfully simple way and leaves us with an even greater appreciation for the universe we live in.We start with the tantalizing possibility of a ' master equation ' that could unite and explain everything ... * everything ! * in this universe , including the four fundamental forces that we know that exist : electromagnetism , the strong nuclear force , the weak nuclear force , and gravity . Green takes us on a tour of how our understanding of the universe came into view with the work of Newton , then Einstein , and then later on to the revolution of the physics at the quantum level.But it is at this point that we run into a problem that has plagued physicists for years , and one that no one has been able to solve just yet . How can we unify all these forces that we know together ? We find , as Green constantly points out throughout the problem - that the answer to this perplexing problem could be in the theory of strings . However , if we are to describe the universe in terms of string theory , there is a very big price to pay.It turns out that out of the mind numbing mathematical equations of string theory , that , as a consequence , we find that we could possibly be living in a universe filled with , not just 3 dimensions that you and I see every day plus 1 ( for time ) , but rather , that we may actually live in a universe of * 11 * dimensions . But the math that arises out of that theory doesn 't stop there - the possibility exists that there may actually be parallel universes ; some of them right next to you and me ! Could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously ? As Green points out ; we have yet to fully find out , but we do know that the math that has arisen from these equations are already showing us that the universe still has much to show us.For those of you who fear that you won 't be able to understand the concepts in this program - fear not . Professor Green does a wonderful job of doing away with the math and harder concepts of physics and instead focuses more on the * concept * - which , when you take away all the math from it , transforms from a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple and , as Green constantly points out , ' elegant ' concept . Viewers of this program need no prior background in science ; the concepts are so simple even a child could understand them.When you finish this program , you will truly come to understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe it is that we live in . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock , Australia , Lindy Chamberlain ( Meryl Streep ) sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience . For it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press , and the whole thing turns into a circus . Lindy doesn 't help matters either because she won 't play to the jury or courtroom , she 's only herself , and she 's a tough nut to crack , so of course everyone thinks she 's guilty because there 's a piece of evidence that hasn 't come to light . Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain , a Seventh-Day adventist pastor , who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife . It 's good ( or bad ) to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the States too , because the Australian public doesn 't believe the story and the media only fans the flames . Eventually , Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor , but years later , a missing piece of evidence shows up and she 's freed , but not until after the family 's life is basically ruined .

" German-born Turkish director Faith Akin captures in his film the endless variety of the different styles in music and songs in Istanbul , a city that is a bridge between East and West , a city that is uniquely located on both sides of the Bosporus , in Europe and in Asia .

We are introduced to Romany instrumentals , to Orhan Gencebay , who has been called the Elvis of Arabesque music - sounds of music are heard everywhere in the city as Faith Akin takes us into underground clubs , to the street performers , and to recording sessions . German bassist Alexander Hacke who comes to Istanbul to play and to learn about Turkish music quotes Confucius , " " To understand the place , you have to listen to the music it plays " . " Akin 's fine documentary does just that - gives us 90 minutes of music that helps to cross the bridges . For me , watching the movie was especially interesting because I recently visited Istanbul as a part of my vacation and spent four days there .

" The quintessential road movie ... if your idea of a road movie involves three would-be magicians with Eastern European accents and Claire Forlani .

After convincing Hugo that he ( Max ) is a ) mental and b ) desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive , the not-so-dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions ( Milo ) and the , ah , gentler attributes of a lovely waitress ( Lydia ) . The unlikely four pile into a van ( obtained by Hugo ... you guess where it came from ) and head to Vegas . Havoc ensues .

" This early role for Barbara Shelley ( in fact , her first in Britain after working in Italy ) , was made when she was 24 years old , and it 's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957 's " " Cat Girl . " " While blondes and brunettes get most of the attention ( I 'll always cherish Yutte Stensgaard ) , the lovely auburn-haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability ( one such example being 1960 's " " Village of the Damned , " " in which her screen time was much less than her character 's husband , George Sanders ) .She is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of " " Cat People , " " and is seen to great advantage throughout ( it 's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase ) .Her character apparently sleeps in the nude , and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened ( also exposed 8 years later in 1965 's " " Rasputin-The Mad Monk " " ) .The ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder ( I don 't see what held that dress up , but I 'd sure like to ) .All in all , proof positive that Barbara Shelley , in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses , rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable , a real test of star power , which she would find soon enough at Hammer 's studios in Bray , for the duration of the 1960 's . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" On the whole one wishes this was a better film , but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth while . Peck made this film during the same period that he made The Gunfighter , before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor . A pity ! He was a fine actor , perfectly willing to tackle characters that were not very likable , and to do them extremely well . The character he plays here is driven and , when necessary , ruthless . Given the mission the character has been assigned , and the " " men " " with which to do it , those characteristics are essential.Without being a spoiler , think of this film as an early , grittier example of The Dirty Dozen genre . The dialog in this film is a bit ham handed but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling . It contains good work by all the character actors and even Barbara Payton turns in a credible performance.This one isn 't often shown on television so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy .

" This film appears to be an expos챕 of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry . Wineries around the world are more and more either joining large conglomerates ( the American producer , Mondavi , in the case of this film ) or paying high-priced experts to help them make " " the perfect wine " " --and as a result , wines are becoming very standard and predictable . To some , this is a good thing ( especially since few can afford to pay $ 50 or more for an everyday wine ) and to others this is horrible as the uniqueness of smaller wineries is disappearing . I truly can understand the concerns of both sides and don 't think there is a villain or hero in this business . Sure , good and cheaper wine is a nice thing , but like what 's happened with beers ( with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch ) , food ( McDonalds ) , shopping ( European shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from American ones ) and mega-stores ( like Walmart / Asda ) are taking away much of the uniqueness of " " the little guys " . " So I definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers . However , with a product that is almost two and a half hours long AND a general lack of focus , the film simply became too big a chore to watch and I lost interest . An 80-90 minute focused film would have been MUCH more effective--especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile ( that 's the high-brow word for a " " wine aficionado " " ) .On the very positive side , the film makers are smart not to do much talking at all--and simply let those on both sides of the issue do the talking . Plus , the topic is so relevant and timely . However , despite choosing a good style of documentary making , the film simply goes on way , way , way too long and ended up making a very dull film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Michael Douglas proves he has still got it , and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife .

" There are few films that leave me with the feeling that Gregor Jordan 's ' Ned Kelly ' film did . Initially I had heard only half hearted recommendations , and decided to see it for myself . Since then , I have acquired both the video and soundtrack , and have to say that after several viewings , I am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film . It is also wonderful to see something Australian ! I appreciate its down to earth quality , that if you ask me is a rarity , as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films . This film proves that you don 't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point . The cast was a bonus , including a variety of well known , and might I add , good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters . It is interesting to note , that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what , and how they only said so many lines . However , if any criticism is due , it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded . In reality , these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in Australian history . For example , on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much , much more to the relationship between Joe Byrne and Aaron Sheritt , and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film . Also overlooked was the fact that it was not only Aaron Sheritt 's efforts alone , that provided the Victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery . Yes , this is their interpretation of the story , and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention . I feel that in this case , this is the only limitation . However , I can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation . It certainly inspired me to look more closely . So , watch it and decide for yourself . You might not like it at all , thats your opinion , and thats fine . Maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an Australian audience ? For me , I 'd call it a breath of fresh air ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Edward Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who makes art out of the least " " artful " " objects imaginable . Everyday items such as crates , boxes , metal containers , etc . - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects d 'art by Burtynsky 's camera . He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them , that is . Even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through Burtynsky 's lens ( but didn 't we already know that from " " Wall-E " " ? ) . He is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where Man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures ( i.e. the workers in those places ) , with their uniform clothing and robotic movements , become part of the industrial landscape . " " Manufactured Landscapes , " " a documentary about Burtynsky 's work , has much of the feel of a " " Koyaanisqatsi " " about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns . Indeed , director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms , as their own camera records Burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in China , a dockyard in Bangladesh , and the construction site at the massive Three Rivers Gorge Dam project in China . With their fluid camera-work , the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of Burtynsky 's images . In fact , the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a Chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows.The movie does less well when Burtynsky gets around to articulating the " " themes " " of his work , which , quite frankly , come out sounding confused , contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best . But it is as a purely aesthetic experience , highlighting image and form , that " " Manufactured Landscapes " " resonates most . In the case of Burtynsky , perhaps , a picture really IS worth a thousand words . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I loved so much about this movie ... the time taken to develop the characters , the attention to detail , the superb performances , the stunning lighting and cinematography , the wonderful soundtrack ... It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won 't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick . If we lived in Elizabethan days , I 'd say this movie 's a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy . But since we don 't , let 's say it 's more like a Drama-Suspense movie.The plot is simple , but the story is complex . The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored . Much of the story is shown rather than told , which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book ( or graphic novel ) . At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s , part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling.I don 't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon , but in this case I do . ( Though I did enjoy the book too . ) I 've bought the DVD , which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary . ( I also took my little cousin , who 's a little younger than the boy in the movie , to see it after I saw it for the first time , because he has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him .

I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered , and lo and behold he came home w / the script . How exciting is that ! Also , a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the ones shown at the amusement park . It 's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again , and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio .

To ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded Richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building , killing himself , everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time .

" There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first . The answer to one of the clues is Murphy 's Law : anything that can go wrong , will go wrong . This is exactly the case for Dan Burns ( Steve Carell , the Office ) a columnist for the local newspaper . Dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life , yet he comes to realize that things aren 't so picture perfect in his own . Dan in Real Life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy , tragedy , and beauty of them all . Besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious.The death of his wife forces Dan to raise his three daughters all on his own ... each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life : the first one anxious to try out her drivers license , the middle one well into her teenage angst phase , and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood . Things take a turn for Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore.Her name is Marie ( Juliette Binoche , Chocolat ) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations ... which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the Burns Family household.If you 've seen Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine , you 'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well . Steve Carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life : the frustration and sincere compassion . The family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax . The movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes , yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability : which is an irony within itself.Dan in Real Life is definitely worth seeing , for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life , and I 'll most likely enjoy it a second time , or even a third .

" Some said that this was a nose candy glorification flick , but short of the original Dr. Hyde 's concoction , no drug has yet been developed that can provide THIS effect . If Viagra was the slime mold stage , that white sparkling powder is the Stephen Hawking evolutionary rung ( or at least the pharmacist idiot savant branch ) . This reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine , seen as was the emperor without clothes . Few of us want to question the health field ; both because most of us would not have lived to our current age had we been born before " " modern medicine " , " and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to live on if we have faith in the helping professions . So the geniuses who produced this movie made jokes out of those Calcutta Bessy 's , giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine . The timing was right , and many were able to see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of Oz . A decade before , when George C. Scott ranted through the movie The Hospital , my wife and I were sitting in the packed premiere in Oklahoma City . Just as in Jekyll & Hyde 's remake , we were almost unable to keep from falling out of our seat , and laughed and howled uncontrollably for the duration . The hundreds of other audience members were deadly silent . They were shocked that doctors , nurses , & the hospital institution were being mocked . It was as if the Pope , Billy Graham , and Gandhi were were sitting in the Animal House , beer stained tee shirts and all , competing to see who could tell the funniest God knock-knock jokes between belches . Had The Hospital been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire , they might have been able to see what was being shown to them . Unfortunately they were like Republicans at a screening of Michael Moore 's 9 / 11 . Perhaps smaller golden parachutes would have been given to the corrupt medical corporation leaders , health insurance companies would have had a tougher time denying medical care , and health providers would have been demystified earlier , if George C. Scott had tap danced in a tutu while delivering his terrible truths . But--forget everything I just said . Watch the movie , be consciously made as happy and joyful and full of laughter as the best ever Saturday Night Live skit , and let the subconscious soak in the documentary of the underlying reality . Just don 't blame me when " " Got to Got to Got to Got to " " becomes one of your sayings , or when " " Hyde 's Got Nothing to Hide " " occupies that portion of your brain now paralyzed by " " Its a Small World After All " . " Or when you start calling your local hospital Our Lady of Pain and Suffering instead of Our Lady of Eternal Construction .

" An interesting thriller that has Paul Winfield as a detective on the case of a murder . Paul Winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease , it was hard to tell the man was even acting . Maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice / narrator of " " City Confidential " , " Winfield ends his career with a so-so movie ; but as always , Winfield shines . A treat to watch.Erika Eliniak is well , Erika Eliniak , nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department . Though , to be fair , this is one of her better efforts.Bottom line : a watchable thriller that shouldn 't be missed by any Paul Winfield fan . A decent telefilm to help send Paul Winfield off to celluloid heaven . What an actor . He will be missed . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Slausen 's Lost Oasis . . . a place for food , fun . . . and MURDER ! After a guy disappears on his way to a gas station , a group of her friends head out on a trip to search for him . They come across a wax museum where they think their friend might have ended up . Unfortunately for the friends , however , the owner of the roadside attraction possesses the power to control his wax mannequins and use them for evil . One by one , the tourists are stalked down and killed by Slausen and his legion of wax dummies . Can the friends escape or will they fall to the same fate as their lost friend ? Following in the footsteps ( and twisting them around ) of the great classic wax films ( House of Wax , Mystery of the Wax Museum ) , Tourist Trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre story and style . As far as character development , action , dialogue , flow , etc . , it seems to be just a basic slasher flick . But , it goes far beyond that as the director takes control of the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller it is . The acting ranges from acceptable ( from the main cast ) to very good ( from backwoods-showman Mr. Slausen ( played by Western-legend Chuck Connors ) ) . The writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured , but there are some flaws in logic as the film moves deeper into the story . Also , some scenes are a bit silly , like the moaning-mannequin attack on Becky . It 's nothing , however , that would detract from the effect of the film . As one would expect from a film about wax dummies , it is full of the endless creepiness supplied by the mannequins . It 's strange that a ( mostly ) inanimate object can just sit still and somehow be so unsettling . . . perhaps it 's the human likeness , or the blank stare , or the fact that you know it 's about to spring an attack . . . whatever it is , the dolls are extremely spooky and that effect is used very well throughout the entirety of the film . As far as slashers go , it 's one of the best , and it stands as one of the creepiest films I 've ever seen.Obligatory Slasher Elements : - Violence / Gore : The film is full of some cool deaths . The gore isn 't excessive , but it 's done well and leaves it as being realistic.- Sex / Nudity : There is an extended skinny-dipping scene with the very attractive lead females ( though ' very attractive ' barely begins to describe the ravishing future-angel Tanya Roberts ) but it 's all a tease as the girls remain mostly underwater . They do remain scantily clad throughout the film , however.- Cool Killer ( s ) : Creepy is just the beginning of Slausen and his mannequins . One of the best killers in the slasher subgenre.- Scares / Suspense : From the opening scene on , the film maintains a great blend of the creepiness of the mannequins , jump scares from the attacks , and a strong level of suspense in the stranded situation . . . it 's all very well done to make for a genuinely scary film.- Mystery : Well , mystery wasn 't really the point of the film . . . just the meaning behind all of it is what matters.- Awkward Dance Scene : All these cute girls and not a single dance . Shame.Final verdict : 8 / 10 . See this creepy slasher ! -AP3- , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As an anti-football person , I ( on the surface ) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film , although secretly I hoped it might be East is East II . The trailers looked fun so I thought I 'd give it a go.It took about ten minutes but after that I was glued to the screen , and that wasn 't anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium . The acting was fresh and vibrant , the characters engaging , and the jokes genuinely funny . The entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so . Football fan or no football fan , sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love , friendship , family , independence and rivalry . Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I 've seen in a long time , dare I say it .... better than East is East.This film trots along nicely at a lovely pace , never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished , keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged . Though not a characteristically twisting-and-turning film , there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things don 't always happen as you would expect.Saying that , there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as script-fillers . I suppose depending on your particular penchant for happy-endings you could be either delighted / let down by the ending . Personally , if there was any other outcome I would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers.As for the actors , I would have to say that Juliet Stevenson ( Paula ) put in the finest performance . I never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do ! Prize for the most unconvincing ( of the main characters ) goes , unfortunately , to Kiera Knightley ( Jules ) , but don 't get me wrong , even she offered a great performance , it 's just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry Kiera , this time you 're it.Tip : Don 't leave before the credits . Once the lights came back up I realised to my horror that perhaps I shouldn 't have watched this film after all . My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice . Oh , what am I saying , it was absolutely brill and I can 't recommend it enough . I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos . I 'm a student . I only splash out if it 's really worth it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Read My Lips ( Sur mes l챔vres ) " " ( which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its French title ) is a nifty , twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope.The two leads are magnetic , Emmanuelle Devos ( who I 've never seen before despite her lengthy resume in French movies ) and an even more disheveled than usual Vincent Cassel ( who has brought a sexy and / or threatening look and voice to some US movies ) .The first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he 's the neophyte . The second half is on his turf as an ex-con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu.Writer / director Jacques Audiard very cleverly uses the woman 's isolating hearing disability as an entr챕e for us into her perceptions , turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does ( so it 's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk ) , using visuals as sensory reactors as well.None of the characters act as anticipated ( she is not like that pliable victim from " " In the Company of Men , " " not in individual interactions , not in scenes , and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line ( well , until the last shot , but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment ) as we move from a hectic modern office , to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake-outs . There is a side story that 's thematically redundant and unnecessary , but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths.This is one of my favorites of the year !

" Honestly , at first , I watched this movie because of the gratuitous sex scenes I heard it possesses but by actually watching the film , it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there . Truly , it is one of the most well-crafted and touching movies I 've ever watched . I 'm a teenage bisexual and the film spoke to me about my predicaments - sex , religion , love , acceptance , etc . It gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my self and others around me who love me for who I am . Cox really handled the movie well by sprinkling dozes of heart-warming lines and a bit of sexuality in it . It made the movie more interesting . Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain but I don 't agree myself . Brokeback Mountain has more drama while Latter Days is well-balanced . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is just one more example of the absolute genius of Gene Wilder . He wrote and starred in this terrific mystery . No one could have done it better . The suspense was palpable throughout .

He truly has a firm grasp on what audiences want and how to deliver it in his writing and , of course , in his brilliant acting . His subtle wit comes through in spades . I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and / or Gene Wilder 's film work . His star just gets brighter and brighter . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Just got my copy of this DVD two disc set and while not perfect , I found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time . I have to say right up front that I am a huge fan of Zombie movies , and I truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too . I also have a soft spot for people who are trying , sometimes against all odds , to live a dream . And again , these people are doing it . Is this some award-winning collection of amazing film ? No . Not even close . But for what they do on their meager budgets , these films should be recommended . For me , the bottom line is always , was I entertained ? Did I have a good time with this movie ? And here the answer to both was " " Yes . " " The first in the series is also the most raw . It opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something . Cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site . Some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility . They get rescued , but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole . Soon , the whole town is overtaken by the undead . And these zombies are fun . They go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white-face ever , but they are fun . The whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead , with our heroes going into the reactor 's lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever ! Pretty cheesy , but I think it was meant to be . Still , it moves very fast , has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style . The acting is uneven , but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track . I went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie . Director Todd Sheets seems pretty proud of this , his first film , but also has no delusions . He knows it 's a trashy zombie movie , but he does show respect to people involved . Also , Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field . The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well . I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for . There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage , mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN , FOX and MTV . Over all , a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges , but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride ! I have seen many DV films , and some shot of video films , and many are quite dull , but this one really wasn 't . While newer DV films are technically superior , they just aren 't fun ! Overall , this is a solid , if a bit flawed , release with plenty of extras and TONS of gore and splatter . While not breaking any grand rules of move making , I found the series to be fun and always a laugh , so I give this set a solid recommendation . Todd Sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks , he was trying , sometimes against all odds it seems , to make fun zero budget , splattery horror and to that end , he has succeeded in spades . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Notable because of it 's notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous Maruschka Detmers takes her young lover 's penis from his trousers and into her mouth . Even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride . Detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged , insatiable delight , wandering about her flat nude . Dressed , partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love , sexual passion , philosophy and politics . For me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fianc챕 is released whilst fellow terrorists are released , she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps , beautifully of course ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I first saw " " Death in Venice " " 1971 ) about 15 years ago , found it profoundly moving and often thought about it . Watching it again few days ago , I realized that it is close to the top of the great works of cinema . With hardly any dialog it captivates a viewer with the beautiful cinematography , the fine acting , and , above all , the Mahler 's music without which the movie simply could not exist . " " Death in Venice " " is a stunning Luchino Visconti 's adaptation of the Thomas Mann novella about a famous composer ( in the novella he was a writer but making him a composer in a movie was a great idea that works admirably ) Gustav von Aschenbach ( loosely based on Gustav Mahler ) who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures . His search for beauty and perfection seems to be completed when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty . Ashenbach ( Dirk Bogard ) follows the boy everywhere never trying to approach him . The boy , Tadzio , belonged to very rare creatures that own an enigmatic and inconceivable power which captivates you , enchants you , conquers you and makes you its prisoner . Ashenbach became one of the prisoners of Tadzio spellbinding charms . He became addicted to him ; he fell in love with him . Was it bless or curse for him ? I think both . He died from unreachable , impossible yet beautiful love which object was perfection itself . The last image Ashenbach 's eyes captured was that of the boy 's silhouette surrounded by the sea and golden sun light . Nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and to take it with you to the grave is the death one can only dream about . If he could , Ashenbach probably would 've said , " " I was able to witness one of the faces of perfection , I could not bear it but I was chosen to learn that it exists here , in this world and I can die in peace now because it did happen to me . " " Unforgettable music , Gustav Mahler 's haunting adagietto of his Fifth Symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie . It reflects every emotion of a main character - it sobs , it longs , it begs for hope , and it summarizes the idea that once you are blessed to encounter beauty you are condemned to die . I may come up with hundreds movies that use classical music to perfection but nothing will ever compare to " " Death in Venice " . " I dare say that Mahler 's music IS its main character - it would change and sound differently depending on what was happening on the screen . It sounded triumphantly when Ashenbach returned back to Venice , to what he thought would be his happiness but turned to be his death . It sounded gloomy when he first entered Venice from the sea . You can hear so many different feelings in it - tenderness and adoration , confusion and self-loathing , worship and melancholy , but always - LOVE that gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts ( literally ) . The movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was for the aging composer / writer / Artist . We are enchanted and captivated by its power and beauty as much as Achenbach was by the boy 's mysterious charm . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The movie was very moving . It was tender , and funny at the same time . The scenery was absolutely beautiful ! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award winning performances . Olympia Dukakis was great .

" STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history . This second appearance of Mickey Mouse ( following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year ) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking . This is because it was the first sound cartoon . While you don 't yet hear Mickey speak , there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.Now if this were just an important historical film , it would be worth seeing--especially to lovers of animation . However , after seeing the short again after about 25 years , I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is . While Mickey and Minnie behave a bit odd compared to the characters we have grown to love ( thanks mostly to the kooky mind and talent of animator Ub Iwerks ) , there is an infectious charm about the film . It 's just adorable seeing Mickey playing " " Turkey in the Straw " " in a highly imaginative ( if occasionally cruel ) way . Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey 's best films even after 80 wonderful years . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Okay , I didn 't get the Purgatory thing the first time I watched this episode . It seemed like something significant was going on that I couldn 't put my finger on . This time those Costa Mesa fires on TV really caught my attention- and it helped that I was just writing an essay on Inferno ! But let me see what HASN 'T been discussed yet ... A TWOP review mentioned that Tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator . Yeah , 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons , especially religious , but here 's one more for ya . On a hunch I consulted wikipedia , and guess what Dante divided into 7 levels ? Purgatorio . Excluding ante-Purgatory and Paradise . ( The stuff at the bottom of the stairs and ... what Tony can 't get to . ) On to the allegedly " " random " " monk-slap scene . As soon as the monks appeared , it fit perfectly in place with Tony trying to get out of Purgatory . You can tell he got worried when that Christian commercial ( death , disease , and sin ) came on , and he 's getting more and more desperate because Christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him . By the time he meets the monks he 's thinking " " hey maybe these guys can help me ? " " which sounds like contemplating other religions ( e.g. Buddhism ) and wondering if some other path could take him to " " salvation " . " Not that Tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a Buddhist , but it appears Finnerty tried that ( and messed up ) . That slap in the face basically tells Tony there 's no quick fix- as in , no , you can 't suddenly embrace Buddhism and get out of here . Tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven . But at the " " conference entrance " , " he realizes that 's not going to be so easy for him . At first I saw the name vs. driver 's license problem as Tony having led sort of a double life , what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people . He feels free to have an affair with quasi-Melfi because " " he 's Kevin Finnerty " . " He figures out that he CAN fool some people with KF 's cards , like hotel receptionists , but it won 't get him out of Purgatory . Those helicopters- the helicopters of Heaven ? - are keeping track of him and everything he does.After reading all the theories on " " inFinnerty " , " though , it seems like KF 's identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths Tony could 've taken in his life . Possibly along with the car joke involving Infiniti 's that made no sense to me otherwise . Aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This was one of the great candidates of a film to re-make as the Original was far from a classic . And if you don 't go into it expecting much , and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole ans just take the movie for what it is . You 'll end up enjoying the ride .

" I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young . Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child , I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery . This movie was ( and still is ) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery 's work or not . Elizabeth always shines in her roles , such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden . Her performance in The Victim as Kate , a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm , with a killer after her is brilliant . If you like exciting suspenseful thrillers than this is one movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end . Another great performance well worth mentioning is that of Eileen Heckhart who plays the eerie and suspicious housekeeper . Unfortunately like most of Miss Montgomery 's movies , The Victim is not available on DVD and I believe that although it was released on VHS some years ago , it is a rarity these days . I was lucky to have taped it when it was aired on television some ten years ago and so have a nice copy of this very good movie . A must see ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word . The comedy concerns a character called Robin Tripp ( played by the great Richard O ' Sullivan ) who finds himself after a wild party , ending up at the home of two ladies called Jo and Chrissy . Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate . The obvious ends up happening as he moves in.Man about the house was a pre-cursor to Cooke and Mortimer 's spin off show George and Mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to Jo , Chrissy and Robin . These two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with Mildred ( the late and much missed Yootha Joyce ) in particular getting some of the best lines of the series . A semi-regular character was Larry ( Doug Fisher ) a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something ( and never to return it ) .The American 's did a version called three 's company but it doesn 't stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original . Thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script . What a pity modern comedy can 't reach that high standard.This programme is available on network DVD , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown.I don 't think Alan Bates has done a better film than this.Its never shown on television . The only time I can recall it being shown on British TV was in the summer of 1998 . I have it on tape but sadly the quality isn 't great due to a dodgy aerial at the time ... I remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on TV . It was shown on Channel 4 in the early hours of the morning , thereby ensuring that it still remained unseen except for a very small audience.I was living in Bristol at the time and it was ironic that , when I finally saw the film , I realised that I had walked past the VERY house where it was filmed several times before ! ! The film treads a fine line ; a married couple attempting to make light of their tragic predicament of coping with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes.The direction and the acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of lapsing into bad taste.A couple of years ago I saw a clip of the filmed theatre production with Eddie Izzard in the role of Bri and Victoria Hamilton playing Sheila.It showed Izzard improvising and larking about and Hamilton jokingly telling the audience to ignore him when he 's being like this.I maybe taking this out of context as I only saw a brief clip but having read the play and seen the film this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful.Izzard was praised for his performance but I felt uncomfortable with what I saw.It is perhaps surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed.This is one of the best British films of the 70s and hopefully it will be released on DVD one day . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Crackerjack , starring Mick Malloy & Judith Lucy - both part of the cast in the early 90 's Saturday night comedy show " " The Late Show " , " Bill Hunter , an Australian movie icon and John Clarke , who we still see regularly on Australian TV along side Brian Dawe.Crackerjack , losely is about a guy in his early 30 's ( Jack Simpson , played by Mick Malloy ) who pays his yearly memebership at the local bowls club in order to get a few car park spaces for which he uses himself and rents out to others as cheap inner city parking.The club falls on hard times , and pulls all the resources and memebers together it can , Jack gets a phone call telling him to turn up to next Saturday 's bowls match or lose his membership ( and conseqently his car park space ) I wont spoil the rest , but the film is funny , light hearted and contains everything a good aussie film should.If your not Australian , then some of the jokes and humour will no doubt baffle you , if you are an Aussie - do yourself a favor and sit yourself down to Crackerjack ..

" My favourite movie of all time . This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary ' Heart of Darkness ' made it even more compelling . Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making ' the Godfather ' and ' GodfatherII ' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like ' Apocalypse Now ' . Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there . Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz 's compound . And just like Willard , he DIDN 'T know what he was going to do once he got there . This is such a masterpiece of American cinema , beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story . What I like most about ' Apocalypse Now ' is that it offers no answers or conclusions . Consequently , because of this open-endedness , it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious . This movie defies categorization . Some call it a war movie which it isn 't at all , really it is more of a personal study of man . The best pic about Vietnam is ' Platoon ' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers . Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas ( Harrison Ford ) and the Playmate review . The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone . Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well . I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless . This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.A little footnote , definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now , watch the original version first , the ' Redux ' version is , I think , more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a ' new and improved ' version of the movie , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really wanted to like this film and I don 't think I was terribly disappointed . Being an American History teacher , I felt an obligation , almost , to see this film and as far as the history went , it wasn 't bad . Sure there were a few mistakes here and there ( especially with the timeline--the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year--not over six years of actual fighting ) , but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent . Unfortunately , the movie ALSO included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich Loyalist . For the most part , it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed " " tacked on " " --like a plot device instead of a real honest-to-goodness romance . In fact , as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb clich챕 of " " love at fist sight " , " it was kind of annoying the more I think about it.However , in spite of this romance , the film is truly interesting and inspiring---plus , in so many ways it seems as if the much later film , THE PATRIOT , was copied from this Griffith film ! ! ! Both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the British and using horrible and evil tactics against the civilians--and both having the secret intention of using this as a " " springboard " " to starting their OWN nation in the America ! ! ! The only major difference is that this film is set in the North and THE PATRIOT was in the Carolinas . It sure would have been nice if Mel Gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to D. W. Griffith for the story ideas . It just doesn 't seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other.PS--Despite me liking this film and some other of Griffith 's films , he DOES deserve to once again " " burn in hell " " for his having White actors portray all the Black servants in the film ! This is a sick and bigoted thing that Griffith did in so many of his films--especially in BIRTH OF A NATION . I gotta assume based on this and the way he portrays Blacks that he was A-OK with slavery and was quite the apologist for this " " quaint institution " " ( don 't get mad at me--this IS meant as sarcasm ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Julie Brown hilariously demolishes Madonna 's attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival Madonna 's own . Cinematography and sets are top notch.Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own injections of comedy that enhances and compliments this film . Appearances by Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale , as themselves , is an added bonus.It 's hard to tell if Brown 's performance is meant to insult or playfully tease Madonna , though I hardly think the Material Girl would find humor in it.My Favorite line : " " Why don 't you come here ( to the Phillipines ) ; all they eat is dog and I 'm a vegetarian .

" I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically . Anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn 't understand action films or recognize a good one . Perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched , but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black ( Lethal Weapon / Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across . Over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming . The final action sequence is one of the best I have ever seen in any film . The cast in this film crackles . Genna Davis gave a tremendous performance and its a damn shame there was never a " " LKG " " sequel . Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as her sidekick Mitch a down on his luck private eye trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks . If Baffles me how anyone could not like this film . It packs so many thrills and its so funny . The wisecracks in this film still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later . In my mind the first Matrix film and the Long Kiss Goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action flicks of the 90 's . Incidentally Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script . At the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny . It 's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance , cause they would have witnessed Renny Harlins best film and Genna Davis like you have never seen her before . Long live " " The Long Kiss Goodnight " " ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter . Unfortunately , in so many ways , this guy was also a jerk in so many ways . Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art . But , other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist . Late in the film , his being annoying , abrasive and needlessly cruel seemed to have diminished . While all this didn 't make him a particularly nice man , it is important to capture on film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist.I really found the movie fascinating and loved how the artists actual works were shown throughout the movie ( like in LUST FOR LIFE ) . I really wish I could show this to my students ( I teach at a school for the arts ) , but can 't because there is just too much adult material . Yes there is nudity , but even more problematic for any audience ( particularly younger ones ) is when he , .... hmmm , ... I don 't think IMDb will even let me describe what occurred , but it was very graphic and involves bodily fluids . Not only a nasty and disgusting scene that did NOT need to be seen , but a reason to keep junior from watching this otherwise wonderful film .

" I was the Production Accountant on this movie , and I also got to do some voice-over work on it , so I 'm not entirely unbiased , but if it were awful , I would say so . I thought it was a fun film , not a critically acclaimed masterpiece , by any means , but there were plenty of laughs along the way . The Bible states that laughter does good like a medicine , so watching this movie could be good for your health.So many of the actors in this picture hadn 't yet reached their peak at the time we made this film . Susan Sarandon , of course , is one who has since gone on to much greater fame . Melanie Mayron was seen on TV on a weekly basis as a photographer in the " " Thirty-Something " " TV drama series . Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger , still haunting people 's dreams . One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor , who played the sheriff . He was an excellent comedic actor , and a truly nice , sincere person . We all had fun working on this show , and I think that fun comes through . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is.I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973 , when it was " " The Stranger " " and I loved it . Such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality , when shows like " " Search " , " " " UFO " , " and " " 6M $ Man " " were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future . Adventure and technology.You got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them . The only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it ; they didn 't get to take your show and add in their own comments over it.I did not know what this concept of a " " pilot " " was . I saw the movie and was hoping thru out that Stryker would get home ; did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hours.Back then , would I understood what so many people hate about the movie now ? I doubt it because I don 't remember it as such . Do I understand now ? Not really for to understand the story , one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie.If one is watching as an American , it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police state ..... but if one is a subject in that state , then compliance could be expected and security can be less . When things are suppose to be perfect , perfect to an extreme degree , perfect that one is not suppose to doubt , then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of order.The subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere . Or that the police state values knowledge to some extent for they are careful about how they control or harm their brain power.These days , one is likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it , so much of the suspense , surprise is lost . But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut 's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR . One gets quite a distance into the movie before it becomes apparent that such a possibility is the least of his concerns.This is the primary difference between " " The Stranger " " and " " Doppelganger " . " The latter can be considered timeless since any comments it has about the USSR are comparatively minor and lost early on in the movie . In the former , those links are through out the movie , supposedly directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after wards.All that said , despite my fond memory for the movie , it is rather easy to see that it would not have made it as a series . Each week , Stryker would make friends , Benedict would chase , Stryker would get away . Eventually , Benedict 's society would get rid of him . Someone else would pick up the chase . A rut would develop . There might be a jab at something new such as perhaps another crew member from Stryker 's mission showing up , but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going.If one goes in with the knives that others have used to slash the movie , odds are they will slash it as well . But if one remembers that this was made during the Cold War and what fears and estimations of the other side were during that time , of what the popular environment contained for the viewer , then they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really wanted to be able to give this film a 10 . I 've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman films to date ( and maybe it still will be--I have yet to watch the Schumacher films again ) . I 'm also starting to become concerned about whether I 'm somehow subconsciously being contrarian . You see , I always liked the Schumacher films . As far as I can remember , they were either 9s or 10s to me . But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton directed films are far superior . I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time around--I ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as I might , I just couldn 't help feel that Batman Returns just has too many small direction , plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.But Burton _ almost _ trumps the problems with sheer force of style , and even though there are a lot of small flaws , Batman Returns is still a great film , especially if you 're a Burton fan , as Batman Returns has just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas ( 1993 ) and Edward Scissorhands ( 1990 ) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe.The film begins strongly , with the Cobblepots having a baby . We see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces , ready to vomit . Later , they have the baby in a small cage . Finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the Gotham City River . The baby ends up becoming Batman villain The Penguin ( Danny DeVito ) .Meanwhile , Max Shreck ( Christopher Walken ) is the film 's " " evil capitalist " , " comparable to Grissom ( Jack Palance ) in Batman . He is planning on duping Gotham City in various ways , and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary , the timid Selina Kyle ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) . When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots , Grissom tries to get rid of her , but she is rescued by cats , becoming Catwoman.While all of this is going on , The Penguin , who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous , begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy , despite having less than benevolent , ulterior motives.Before re-watching Burton 's Batman films this time , I didn 't remember just how little the films are about Batman ( Michael Keaton ) . It 's almost as if Burton didn 't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on . The focus here is much more on the villains , especially The Penguin . Batman doesn 't appear very often , especially in the beginning of the film , and surprisingly often , we 're watching him watching The Penguin.Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw , I can 't say that I do , even if I 'd like to know more about Batman and follow his story more . The villains ' stories are interesting , too , and as an " " origin story " " for two major Batman villains , Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot.However , there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw . The Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding , but even though they 're frequently on screen , we never get to learn anything about them . Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in Tod Browning 's Freaks ( 1932 ) available , with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli , but he just doesn 't have the space to use them.For that matter , he hardly has space to explore Catwoman . The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as The Penguin , but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long . So the bulk of the Catwoman scenes had to be excised . Of course , all of this barely leaves any room for Batman . Burton has Batman turn very dark in the public 's eye in this film , and unusually , he never bothers to resolve this . As far as we know , at the end , Gothamites still think that Batman is a murdering lunatic . That 's an interesting development , but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.As for the script , although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions ( in terms of logic ) made by characters , it 's clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story . A lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented , but often this is fairly subtle and / or complex ( of course , sometimes it is very blatant or transparent , too ) . It helps to look at Batman Returns as a more " " poetic " " film , as I believe was the intention . This also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions , including from minor characters , are done in service of a general mood or style , and that style works very well . " " Dark " " is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in a word , and whether that 's a positive or negative depends on your disposition . Anyone who knows me knows that I love dark . So for me , Burton 's style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script . In many ways , Batman Returns is like an insane , campy horror film , with beautifully eerie production design . Like Batman , Burton is still making many references to other films , but instead of Vertigo ( 1958 ) and Star Wars ( 1977 ) ( well , there 's still a slight Star Wars reference ) , he invokes films like Nosferatu ( 1922 ) ( including that " " Max Schreck " " was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there ) , Motel Hell ( 1980 ) , the aforementioned Freaks , Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory ( 1971 ) ( which has a surreal , dark edge to it ) and zombie films--made most explicit in The Penguin 's final scene.In terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general " " feel " " of the story , the characters and so on--this couldn 't be a stronger 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Some bad reviews here for this and I understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than most.I thought that this worked in a way because afterwards I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isn 't it ? I would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven . David Hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like Last House.Other than that - worth a look . , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto. the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace. it was amazing , the choreograph was excellent as well as most of the visual effects.the story line is something new to naruto. but it is basically the same as the first movie. in the series u see them fight against other ninjas , but in the movies ( 1 + 2 ) u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction. it is nice to see them fighting something other then ninja , and that it was great to see some other power other then chakra. and how other people from other land across the ocean fight. also sakura finally killed someone that is more stronger then her . ( she have truly become strong ) it was a lot better then the fillers on the series that i 'm watching now. when u watch this movie the fast action scene will surely make your heart pound . With new jutsus and garra in the movie , u know it is good. and the music was good as well , but i find it to be lacking something . But the ending theme song was a plus . ( dind dong dang ) i think was a really good song . I totally recommend it.all in all i give this movie a 10 , because i just love it. if u do decide to watch it , enjoy it. lol , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm guessing that we all , no matter if we are fans of cars , luv the sound of a Dodge Challenger as it growls along the road , the noise a 57 Chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and , most of all , the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes . I 'm not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination , but any of the above really does rev my engine ! There 's no denying the importance of transport on cinema . It has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema ( looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different time / space ) . But the car remains the most popular and most luved , it 's even got its own genre : the carsploitation genre . A genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars . In effect , it 's just porn ! Car porn ! And I 'm not talking about that rather nasty documentary on Channel 4 in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars . Whatever floats your ... car , I guess . Moving on ... whilst RUNNING ON EMPTY isn 't quite as pornographic as VANISHING POINT ( Richard C. Sarafian , 1971 ) for instance , with its close ups of the car in motion , all it 's bumps and curves ( ! ) , this doesn 't mean that the car isn 't the main focus of this film . In fact , the cars themselves become characters ( more on that later ) . They 're objectified and fetishised as much as the women , in fact , maybe even more . And holy holy , are these cars something ! Every car in this film ( besides the ones in the background ) are simply beautiful 혯 works of art , there 's no question about it.As I was saying , these incredible cars are , in a way , given characters themselves . You actually start sympathising with the car ! SPOILER 혯 Most notably during the scene in which the car is being wrecked and burnt SPOILER OVER . This has become almost a convention of the carsploitation genre ; the evil 1978 Plymouth Fury from CHRISTINE ( John Carpenter , 1983 ) , Satan 's custom Lincoln Mark III in THE CAR ( Elliot Silverstein , 1977 ) , the nifty little Mini Coopers from THE Italian JOB ( Peter Collinson , 1969 ) to the friendly Volkswagen Beetle in THE LOVE BUG ( Robert Stevenson , 1968 ) and of course each car from DEATH RACE 2000 ( Paul Bartel , 1975 ) and even WACKY RACES ( 1968-1970 ) all of which had their own character . Ironically however , this emphasis on the car often over takes ( ! ) the human characters ! And this is certainly the case with RUNNING ON EMPTY , in which only one human character ( the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than sight ) has any sort of dimension , the rest are very much stock characters . These are all your stereotypical Australian 1980s teenagers ; big hair , annoying accents and none of whom would look out of place in NEIGHBOURS , especially the Kylie Minouge look-a-like . But who gives a damn ? It 's all about the cars racing and crashing ! That 's it ! If you don 't like that you really are watching the wrong genre.The car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film , and the best thing it 's got going for it . They are fast ; very fast ! And we 're not talking about the rather annoying technique some films seem to use where they record the car ' speeding ' at around 40mph , and then speed it up . Oooh no ! Not with this film you don 't . These cars are zooming along at top speeds in real time 혯 no fancy editing tricks here . So , we 've got speed . Check . What about crashes ? Check , check , check ! Whilst there isn 't cars crashing EVERYWHERE a la the incredibly BLUES BROTHERS ( John Landis , 1980 ) , when cars do crash in this film , they certainly crash ! It would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as one little hit and KABOOM they 're up in flames . It kind of reminded me of THRILLER : A CRUEL PICTURE ( Bo Arne Vibenius , 1974 ) in that sense.Between these simply awesome scenes ( especially the very start and the very end ) there are quite a few scenes which slow everything done and , in my opinion , fail to add very much to the film . Note : more exploding cars needed ! However there are a couple of exceptions here which are great scenes 혯 SPOILER especially the attempted rape scene.So , all in all , this is a man 's film ! A boy 's film ! Full of cars vroom vroom vrooming around the outback and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure too . I 'd recommend this little film to anyone even if they are keen cyclists ( ! ) 혯 it 's a great film which you can just switch your brain off , sit back in your leather chair and put on full volume ! I 'll give it 3.5 luvs out of 5 luvs 혯 Bruuuuum ! P.S 혯 Amazon are selling this for just over 짙2 혯 it 's a real bargain although the DVD lacks any special features whatsoever . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" the acting is good.thats the positives out of the way ! SOSN is shallow and superficial.Almost all the characters are middle class and English.The gay men are depicted as fickle sexual predators aiming to use children in their empty lives.This film could only appeal to people who know hampstead heath and would get minor satisfaction from pointing out any landmarks.There is no time to engage with the characters and has a result you really don , t care about them , Catherine Tate at the height of her comedic fame stars as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on screen for about the same time as her Nana sketches failed to convince , however if she had said " " what a f * * * * * * liberty " " i would have agreed I 'd rather take a walk in the Park ; unintelligent rubbish ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I was pleased to see that she had black hair !

In fact I watched the film twice in one day , a sure sign that it was up to standard . This is what I do with books that I like as well.I thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip .

Also , this is a very complex character , whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie . The character of Boz makes this movie so good .

" In Victorian times a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and they are sent to live in the country . The children adapt to their new situation , make friends , and enlist the help of a kind old man they wave to on the train to help reunite their family.Actors who direct movies are often not very good at it . Jeffries however , the great veteran actor of dozens of British comedy classics , is one of the few exceptions . His brilliant conception ( he also wrote the script , from the novel by E. Nesbit ) of a classic British children 's story is what raises this film to art . Whilst the story may be highly idealised , the wonderful performances and the fabulously evocative Yorkshire dales settings combine to make a truly memorable movie . The photography by Arthur Ibbetson is the definition of good movie-making - not a shot is wasted in telling the story but at the same time the images combine to create a fabulously romantic atmosphere . Agutter is simply perfect as the kind-hearted Bobbie ( okay , I fell in love with her at an early age , but I defy anyone to disagree ) and Cribbins , whose comic acting pedigree is on a par with Jeffries , is unforgettable as Perks the humble-yet-proud railway porter . This is a film out of time ; romantic , charming , hugely enjoyable and with a beautifully naive sense of good-hearted kindness towards all . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd say that a full 3 / 4s of the film is great . I can even isolate the bad bit . It 's everything that has to do with the romance . Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30 . I 'd recommend skipping that section if you can . It does nothing except explain his exile . It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside . Fortunately , the period from about 0-30 and 1 : 00-2 : 19 ( The End ) is excellent.There are a number of excellent performances in this film , and an equal number of terrible ones . Just like everything else in this movie the acting is either perfect or terrible . Peter Ustinov as the slimy one-eyed slave Kaptah is perfect . It is one of his best performances , up there with his role in Spartacus . Victor Mature as the ambitious Horemheb is also perfect . Again , one of his best roles . Jean Simmons is wasted as Merit , the perfect girl in love with our hero John Carradine gives a nice supporting role as a philosophical grave robber ; and Michael Wilding is excellent as Akhnaton , the idealistic pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt only to see it fall apart due to his unwillingness to fight . Now for the bad . Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is sadly miscast . This is doubly unfortunate as he is the main character . The entire film revolves around him . He actually does rather good as the disillusioned exile and the wise old man . This is because of his sorely limited range . He doesn 't seem able to put any passion into his words . This is especially apparent during the love scenes which are beyond awkward . He spends the last half of the film as an old man , a performance at which he is decent enough at . He does have the perfect voice for the character . The less said about Bella Darvi as Nefer , the treacherous Babylonian woman , the better.The costuming and sets are magnificent . This is the only film that I know of that attempts to depict life in Egypt that isn 't overshadowed by Jews or Romans . The film takes place in the 14th Century B.C. which is before even Exodus . The only monotheists are the pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers . There is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epics , but it is done differently and it only shows up at the very end . An interesting note : by having Akhenaten followed by Horemheb as pharaoh , the film completely skips over the most famous pharaoh of all : Tutankhamen . Seems kind of a strange thing to do when using that name could increase awareness of the film.Be warned : this is a 1950s epic film . If you don 't like that type of thing then don 't expect this one to be different . It is different , but it is still an epic . I appreciate this film , and I appreciate what it did and what it tried to do . This is a film that should be better remembered than it is . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Like the first touch of pleasure and guilt , like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear , like a climax of contrary emotions " " said one of the movie buffs after viewing LOVE AT THE TOP , the misinterpreted title version of stylish director Michel Deville 's LE MOUTON ENRAGE . Vincent Canby in New York Times , however , just after the 1974 premiere of the movie stated : " " LOVE AT THE TOP which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse , is a 1973 French comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteen-fifties English comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessing혰and possessed by혰ambition . " " Yet , the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that LOVE AT THE TOP is not concerned with the English class system ... ( January 27 , 1975 ) Having left the evaluations up to single individuals , of course , the test of time has done its just job . What may be said with certainty after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find such movies like LE MOUTON ENRAGE where decadence appears innocent , where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic , where feelings occur so manipulative . For Romy Schneider 's fans , it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see , not only because she gives a unique performance ( as she did in all of her roles ) at the heyday of her career ( 9 years before her sudden death ) but because she is particularly attractive here . It is not TRIO INFERNAL where the , so to say , ' forced escape ' from and the mockery of Romy 's sweet image haunted for years by saccharine Sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation , but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role . She plays Roberte , a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story 's lead , playboy Nicolas Mallet ( Jean Louis Trintignant ) . It is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons . This movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of Romy and she is given some of her very best scenes . Romy 's sex appeal is unforgettable here.Another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception . Immoral as it may seem , the director makes a perfect use of contrast : conventions vs pleasures , innocence vs decadence , genuine lust vs instrumental affair . Nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest , may find attractive or disgusting ; yet , his are the features the viewers must treat seriously , more to say , they are the ones we all must accept . That is why , one is led to a peculiar , gently wild , erotically unique world of the main character . Although he sleeps with lots of women , there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for Nicola : Roberte Groult ( Romy Schneider ) and Marie-Paul ( Jane Birkin ) . He manipulates them , makes love to them , cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money ; yet , he perceives them differently . Yet , despite all of this ' adult maturity , ' he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy-car on the table - a sort of ' detailed insight into male mind ... ' in a comedy-like way , of course.Finally , there are very good performances , which makes LE MOUTON ENRAGE slightly underrated . Not only the aforementioned Romy Schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role , but young Jane Birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young , inexperienced streetwalker Marie Paul , Jean Louis Trintignant makes it possible to see Nicola in the right way . This artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by Camille Saint-Sa챘ns , the tune that will ring in your ears for long . Therefore , apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors , slow action ( sometimes ) , possible clich챕s ( noticed by some viewers ) , the merits should be found significant . LE MOUTON ENRAGE , in sum , is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life . It is worth seeing as a moment in Romy 's career , a prelude to strong eroticism , a chain of contrary emotions , of love and hatred , appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm ... But aren 't we , humans , ' viewers , ' movie buffs built upon such contrasts ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a weird and compelling film . The topic , about the atom bombs created at Los Alamos , NM in the USA and used on Japan during the latter part of World War II , is huge , and of course deeply disturbing . The film 's plot takes on a lot of heavy issues and the actors have to carry much of the creative tension . I had never seen the film , or was much interested in it I have to admit , until I read the book " " Smoking in Bed : Conversations with Bruce Robinson . " " Robinson wrote the story and screenplay . I think the film was better than I expected from reading Robinson 's point of view in the conversations about it , but I can see how he thought it got derailed . I think Paul Newman is pretty good , but is somehow at bottom , miscast . He 's too Hollywood . At one point , a big , mean-looking guy storms into Newman 's office and has such a striking presence , I immediately thought he should be playing the character Newman is playing . The other lead , who plays the head scientist , is also fairly good , but somehow not brilliant enough to portray the huge angst that goes with the part - the immense responsibility for creation of an ultimate machine of death and destruction . One of the more effective characters seems to be a composite personality , played by John Cusack . He is oddly affecting throughout , and in the end , is the character whose fate really hits home and who made me think most vividly of the fate of more than 200,000 Japanese people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Although I am not a Michael Jackson fan , I like some of his early songs and some from Jackson 5 too . ' Thriller ' is one of his great songs and it comes from the best-selling album ever with the same title . As for the video , it is awesome , one of Michael 's best , but also very eccentric and weird.There is a story behind this video , but it 's so complex that even I can 't fully understand it . It 's freaky . The freakiest things are Jackson 's transformation into a werewolf , his evil red eyes at the end ( like a werewolf ) and those dead people dancing.The video is very dark , thrilling , chilly and original . There are great sceneries and settings . The music itself is full of life and rhythm , characteristic from the good old pop from the 80 's.I like Vincent Price 's soliloquy . He does a great narration with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laughter at the end is awesome ! My favorite videos of the ' King of Pop ' are " " Billie Jean " " and " " Don 't stop ' til you get enough " " ( both among his best songs ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971.At this point , America knows they are fighting a loosing battle , and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the ' Tigerland ' training camp in Louisiana.The film is more of a character study no real plot , but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz , who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man , who only wants to escape the camp . We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.I 'd have to say this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general .. Great acting , and very memorable . Also the directors use of film and style works so well , cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam . Its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle . The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell ... and it 's futility.Fantastic film . Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being ' in the army ' .Rating 9 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" To all the reviewers on this page , I would have to say this movie is worth seeing . So It was made in 1972 , so what . The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time . People who didn 't study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball . Compared to the modern series , ' Left Behind , ' ( Which is made for our time right now ) it does look cheezy . However , the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion , which again was over 30 years in the past . BUT . The message that is sent in this film is very powerful , and carefully preserved . There is just so much to say , but I refuse to say it . ( for fear of spoiling it ) So go out and see this film ! If you don 't like the message that it sends , then you have issues , that need some attention ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Another one for the Babes & Bullets crowd . The story is much edgier than any other musical I have seen : cannons hidden up the missing legs of females , and places each generatively in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the locale . More effective than contemporary ' drama . ' It is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants -- in lue of leggage . Pretty remarkable if you consider the context.Despite the cannon up the leg thing providing 90 % of the surprises , this film also chronicles how greed supersedes all other considerations in the lives of a group of yakuzas who pursue a woman who keeps up her leg a concealed cannon / rocket-launcher ( hence no group shower scenes or thongs ) The hidden projectile-launcher which is pulled out from the behind the protagonists back , seemingly from nowhere , in miike 's Dead or Alive ( 1999 ) , The torch brought forth out of thin air by the heroine towards the end of the original Tomie ( 2000 ) , or the harrowing flame-thrower scene in Sunny Gets Blue ( 1992 ) , all testify to an almost third-world Cantinflas-esquire influence in the contemporary Japanese cinema , of which I am at a loss to explain , but cannot complain.You won 't see good quality movies of this essence made in Hollywood , its all but extinct and with cheap crap they pump out for a cheap thrill , is all but laughable . This is a true film and while its great in its entirety , the ending is a brilliant , if not unblatant rip-off of certain Sergio Leon pictures , involving cannons where legs should be , and certainly is appropriate ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970 . This twenty year spell can be rightly labelled the ? 쏥olden Era ? ? of the genre .

Following an incident one meal-time , he is booted out of the workhouse and ends up employed at a funeral parlour . But Oliver doesn ? 셳 settle particularly well into his new job , and escapes after a few troubled days . He makes the long journey to London where he hopes to seek his fortune .

But his chances of being reunited with his real family are jeopardised when Bill Sikes forcibly exploits Oliver , making him an accomplice in some particularly risky and ambitious robberies . ? 쏰liver ? ? is a brilliantly assembled film , consistently pleasing to the eye and excellently acted by its talented cast . Moody recreates his stage role with considerable verve , stealing the film from the youngsters with his energetic performance as Fagin .

" I can safely admit ( as an IMDb geek ) that ' Phantom Lady ' will never crack into my film noir top twenty . It may not even sneak into the top fifty . But rather than discredit the film for not being as good as so many other classics of the film noir genre , it should be noted that ' Phantom Lady ' has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a worthwhile viewing . All that is required from the viewer is the ability to get beyond the dreadfully slow beginning.The film doesn 't get cooking until ' Kansas ' ( Ella Raines ) sets about trying to prove all but single handedly the innocence of her boss , Scott Anderson ( Alan Curtis ) , who has been convicted of murder . ' Kansas ' is Anderson 's secretary by day and amateur detective by night . As the novice sleuth she does quite well for herself while working the streets of New York at night . Little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together . To be honest , the film belongs to Raines and it is only due to her presence that the film works well at all . Somehow she is able to breathe life into a film about a condemned man who is not interesting in the slightest . I 'm not sure if this splintered dynamic of a characterless leading man becomes the fault of the actor or the director , but clearly this is where something becomes terribly wrong with the film.As interesting as Raines is as a novice detective , things really accelerate into another hidden gear when ' Kansas ' pays a late night visit to a wandering drummer ( Elisha Cook , Jr . ) in search of some information to help her condemned boss . She and the drummer paint the town a new kind of red while visiting the " " all night " " jazz clubs . Trying to describe this scene will either prove an injustice to the scene or worse yet , it could ruin the scene all together . You 'll know the scene once the last cymbal crash has finished ringing out . If you 're lucky enough to have this film on DVD , you 'll more than likely be rewinding this scene again and again . As good as Raines is , it is this scene that makes this film noteworthy . It is mainly because of this scene that I rate ' Phantom Lady ' a 7 instead of a 6.For the most part this film comes off as tepid and bland with a few great scenes and one magnificent scene . It is the ' drum / sex scene ' that separates this film from any others of the same ilk.And just like it is said in the film that " " you never go wrong with Vanilla " , " I would also like to add that " " going with Vanilla " " is the safe fall back choice when one can 't decide on having a tastier treat.7 / 10 .

" I can not quite understand why any of the " " reviewers " " gave this documentary " " 0 " " other than for political reasons . No , the film did not investigate both " " sides " " of the story , but then surely one film in favour of Chavez against the tides of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance out the narrative overall ( especially given A. the history of CIA involvement in Latin America in fermenting civil unrest - google National Security Archive and B. the coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly faked scenes of Chavez supporters shooting non-existent opponents ) .

" I just got back from the GLBT Film Festival at the AMC Loews 34th in NY . A friend told me about this film . Audience response was very positive ! Lots of good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of realization . Top notch in every area . A movie that makes you think , and then makes you realize how lucky we 'd all be if we could turn back time and live without shame or guilt . I imagine this will come close to , if not win , the audience favorite award ! What was most surprising was the fact the the movie appears to start off as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the very group it started to satirize . There isn 't any mean spirited humor at the expense of one group , just a slow realization that we would all be better off if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started off with . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Back in the day if Marion Davies had had her druthers and didn 't just listen to William Randolph Hearst , she 'd have done more films like Show People and been a lot happier . In fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy , she 'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like When Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith . What you 're seeing by all accounts in Show People is the real Davies , a gifted comedienne , a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person . She could really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper aka Patricia Prepoire , she put up with her share of pretense in her Hollywood stardom.If the plot of Show People was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story . I guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story . Marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in Hollywood like so many others , looking for that big break . She wants to drama , but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics . She gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face , but learns her trade . And also wins the heart of young comic actor William Haines.She does get her first big break , but it doesn 't come for Haines as well and Marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor Paul Ralli , playing Andre Telfair , a pretend no account Count of Avignon . Somebody here was taking a shot at actor Lou Tellegen , lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others and to hear tell of it , one of the most despised people in cinema.Show People was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves . You will get to see folks like Charlie Chaplin , Douglas Fairbanks , William S. Hart , Mae Murray , John Gilbert , Eleanor Boardman etc . , just being themselves in and around the film colony . That in itself makes Show People a film worth saving.Show People also made good use of standard Tin Pan Alley songs like , Ain 't We Got Fun , I 'm Sitting On Top Of The World , You 'd Be Surprised , California , Here I Come . As the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced , a song called Crossroads was introduced in it . It 's not a bad number , but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack . I guess since they 're not seen , it was felt no billing was necessary . Still I 'd like to know and I 'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see Show People.It 's easy to see why Marion Davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite . She looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have become a big fan of the work of Barbet Schroeder , so maybe I am already a little biased by now , but I think this movie is great , although there may be a few lengths . It is a romantic unromantic view of the Great Liberation in the later sixties , stylistically amazingly polished ( great set design ! ) and in my opinion still very watchable.Basically this is an ironic re-telling of the story of Adam and Eve who are driven from paradise after having tasted the 혙forbidden fruit " " which has turned from an apple into a hypodermic filled with heroine . The woman seduces a man into using it thus accelerating his doom . I say accelerating as the guy seems to be doomed and bound for an intensive life and an early grave right from the great title sequence onwards . There is no place for any hope.Although the story is rather sad , I was captured by the beauty both of the beautiful location Ibiza and Mimsy Farmer . I found her character was at once shallow , enigmatic , endearing , annoying , interesting and boring . Somehow she represents what men see in women in a basic , unoffensive way . Architecture and built artifacts in general are put to very good use 혯 which seems to be a Schroeder trademark of sorts.There is even some humor , mainly delivered by Stefan , the German main character and his accent . His main nemesis is not a snake but an older German of dubious reputation 혯 and provider of the heroine - called Wolf . Although it is a German name and Stefan is German , he pronounces it verrry English and in fits of jealousy spits the name out at his girlfriend in regular intervals 혯 becoming a boy who cries ...

" This movie is about Carlos " " The Jackal " " ( Quinn ) , an international terrorist who , by CIA agent Henry Fields 's ( Sutherland ) description , appears to maim women and children for the heck of it . At least that 's what he says to guilt US Naval Officer Annibal Ramirez ( Quinn again ) into taking on the assignment of posing as Carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB . Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos but mentally he is his antithesis . He is borne of order and Carlos is borne of chaos.The movie isn 't all shoot-gun-jump-around action , and that 's a good thing . In its first half , Ramirez undergoes training to act and think like Carlos , and that 's actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run-of-the-mill action flicks . An Israeli agent ( Kingsley ) , joins Fields in training Ramirez , and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of Ramirez 's new character . Ramirez is taught to dislike the things Carlos dislikes , to act on the split second like Carlos would , and even to make love like Carlos ( courtesy of an ex-girlfriend of Carlos 's ) . Naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie . It 's a little contrived but Quinn gives a riveting performance as a Carlos-wannabe.Another thing I liked about this movie was that it didn 't utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies - you know , the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twin 's family . Ramirez 's family does come into the picture , but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life.Good chuckle humor is injected into this movie , often coming the acerbic duo of Sutherland and Kingsley . An exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving Ramirez 's first name ( Annibal , Annabelle , get it ? ) . Also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent Carlos is . In my opinion , during the final showdown , the payoff wasn 't able to match the build-up.On the whole , the movie was enjoyable . I 'm not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout.My rating : 9 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I first saw this show , I thought it looked interesting . I watched it , saw how it revolved around Sarah , like the character sees the world ... revolving around her . I got it , but wasn 't laughing very much.Onstage and in her show , she 's racist , crude , insensitive and hugely self-centered . I didn 't get her at first , and took it all at face value . Then I got to see her movie , Jesus is Magic . I think that served as a Sarah Silverman primer for me , explaining to me just what ' language ' she 's speaking . She 's like Marilyn Manson , working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images , but you eventually realise it isn 't an assault , it 's a statement . And once you understand that , you find you 're glad someone 's finally giving it to you straight.I don 't mean to suggest only smart people will understand , or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy . While I like a lot of ' smart ' shows , I still to this day do not see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm . I get the impression that it 's good , but I just don 't get it .

" As a non-theist Im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago . Safe to say , science is based on evidence , religion is based on blind faith . Nuff said there then.The film was produced by the BBC , and to be honest , it could quite easily have been shown on television . While the acting is superb , the film itself isn 't really worthy of a full blown cinema release . That said , if it reaches a wider audience this way , then so be it . But I have seen many period style dramas on BBC TV and they were well up to the finished standard of this . Just don 't expect too much of a big budget thrill ride when going to see it.In some ways , I found the movie almost going out on a limb to apologise to religious fundamentalists . While it attains a good sense of tension the whole way through , I couldn 't help wanting it to get to the publication of The Origin Of Species much quicker than it actually did ( you 'll wait right until the end for that ) . And it seemed to dwell much more than I was ever aware on Darwin 's struggle with himself and his wife Emma , portraying him almost as some kind of insane lunatic at times - which is hardly true . There are many other errors and facts missing in relation to the real story of the lead up to the publication of Origin too , but the whole premise of the movie focuses almost entirely on the difficulty Darwin faced domestically with the book , and a small portion on the death of his beloved daughter Annie . This gives the film its most moving scene , where Annie passes away as she asks one final time to hear Darwin tell her the story of a captive orangutan which died of pneumonia . Though , you 'll probably feel a bigger connection with the primate in that scene than with Darwin 's daughter.With the early controversy apparently surrounding the movie in the USA it will work well to promote it and ensure many more people will get to see it . But to be honest , there is actually very little in it that insults any mythical Godhead . Its hardly headline news about a theory that has been around 150 years after all . But , as fundamental Christians ( and many other religions which we 're all well aware of ) like to wave a placard or two whenever possible , I guess this movie is as good excuse as any . Personally , I cant see what all the fuss is about . But maybe they 're just monkeying around ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Certainly this film has the ring of truth about it , as it purports to be based on actual occurrences at a Marine base . It deals with the attempted cover-up by the local Marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a Marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend , a Marine captain . The man and woman had been lovers , but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married . He continued to stalk her , going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time . Finally he broke into her home , attacked her with a knife , and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed . The civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense , but the Marines decided to charge the captain with murder . The major , you see , was a decorated hero from Vietnam , and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the Marine base . The captain , too , had made some enemies in her motor pool command , rejecting some male advances in a very butch style.There is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama , which the very capable cast gets across nicely . The director and editor , however , seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view . You 're lucky if you know where you 're at most of the time . Bear with them , though ; it 's a worthwhile story as the captain 's court martial trial unfolds , and it seems every man 's hand is against her , even her attorney at times . The verdict ? Well , after all , this is rather a suspense story , so you 'll have to see for yourself . There is a kind of " " pacifist " " message folded into the film , but forget about that . Sure , " " war is hell " , " but sometimes it can 't be avoided . We 'll need those Marines then , even if they aren 't always the best champions of fair play internally .

" " " Hail The Woman " " is one of the most moving films I have ever seen in my entire life . I watched it twice in a row and sobbed my eyes out.This silent film masterpiece deserves a much wider viewing audience ; unfortunately the sole surviving print is so badly scratched that most people won 't watch it all the way through , and they will miss the gem shining underneath the rough . This film could use a digital restoration , to help bring out its beauty , but I doubt it will get it from anyone , since its main theme is Spiritual restoration before Christ of the family unit , and this is not politically correct these days . However it remains a powerful theme for those whose hearts are hurting from the pain of broken family relationships.The cast is magnificent , especially Florence Vidor , who literally glows as Judith , the daughter ; ethereal Madge Bellamy as Nan , the poor girl who gets pregnant and is cast aside ; Theodore Roberts as the crotchety old domineering father who destroys everyone around him through pride ; and handsome Lloyd Hughes , as the son David , afraid of his father , but really of life itself . This is a nice film to watch at Christmas , especially . You will not regret being patient and viewing it in its entirety despite its deterioration . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is absolutely the best 80s cartoon ever , maybe the best cartoon of all time . It had everything action , adventure , thrill , and much more ... I can 't imagine how hard it was for Ruby-Spears company to make this great cartoon , there has been spent a lot of money for this masterpiece of work and it was worth it , for example just the beaming down scenes were hard because I wouldn 't call the 1980s for a great technology year with computers like now in the world we live in so the beaming down scenes were excellent !

My good friend Ted made this petition to either get the show back on TV or better on DVD , that is if we get many requests to get them back on DVD.So please help us by signing the petition at http : / / www.petitiononline.com / 6600F / petition.html , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw Teen Devian in 1993 telecasted in Doordarshan on a Friday night , and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in Bollywood . It was mind blowing 혯 a film with a " " modern " " storyline , superb music , three lovely ladies and my fave superstar Dev Anand.In this unusual storyline , Dev falls in love with three women 혯 the simple Nanda , the ravishing Kalpana and the sophisticated Simi . They too are enamored with him and want to marry him . This puts Dev in a dilemma ( which is the crux of the storyline ) - whom to marry ? . He consults a hypnotist who asks Dev to gaze into a crystal ball . Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda . Beautifully directed ( most probably by Dev saheb himself & not by Amarjeet the official director ) the B & W classic has evergreen music 혯 some of SD Burman 's ( helped generously by RD Burman ) best compositions . " " Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth " " is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in Hindi films . Credit should also be given to Majrooh Sultanpuri for penning the memorable lyrics Teen Devian is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of Dev Anand and he did full justice to the role . Unfortunately Teen Devian has never received the recognition & popularity it richly deserves.A must see for any Hindi film buff , I will rate the eternal favourite 9.5 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a long-time fan of Studio Ghibli and especially Hayao Miyazaki films , I went to the film right on the opening day . When I went out of the theater I had this strange feeling that something was missing , this " " magical " " feeling I was experiencing in all Miyazaki films before , but I couldn 't say why it failed this time . After I thought about the other Ghibli movies , I may know the reason : this film had most of the elements of a great Miyazaki anime : cute characters , wonderful key animation , a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and the warm story telling giving you the feeling of watching a high quality Japanese animation film . However , two elements were lacking : a deep story and dramaturgy . The purpose of this film was obviously to entertain small children with a simple story line as in case of " " Totoro " , " so a complicated story as been told in " " Spirited Away " " or " " Princess Mononoke " " is not really necessary , but on the other hand , this story was simply too superficial . I could not connect to the main characters , because there was no character development , dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long . I really hate to give only 7 stars for a Miyazaki film , because I would give 10 stars to all previous movies right away , but this time it was simply not this wonderful " " ghibli experience " .

" I 've noticed that a lot of people are taking Opera to task for the way Betty reacts to the murders . I think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine a " " normal " " person would react . The thing is ... Betty is not a " " normal " " person , due to traumatic events in her childhood . She has problems way way before the movie ever even starts ... and by the end of Opera ... in my opinion ... she has become totally unhinged.---------------------SPOILERS--------------------------------------- You have to keep in mind that when she was a very small child she witnessed her mother 's lover commit at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochist mother was getting off watching it.She was raised by a woman who achieves sexual release tied up watching girls get hacked , slashed , and strangled to death . That does not make for a healthy home life . I think it 's pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have employed all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never snitched on her . It is also likely that at her impressionable age , Betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw . Is this just something that adults do , etc.Betty obviously looks up to her mother ... I mean ... she 's become an opera singer just like her . If mommy likes it it can 't be bad , can it ... mommy can 't be bad , can she ? She couldn 't tell the police on her mommy or this mysterious hooded fellow she associates with mommy.Betty has a lot of deep-seated emotional issues . Her mind has for years been trying to block out the memory of what she saw her mother doing ... but it keeps coming to the surface , manifesting itself in the form of horrible nightmares , skull-throbbing migraines , a dependence on relaxation techniques , and sexual frigidity She associates brutal violence / bloody death with sex on a subconscious level . There 's an inner struggle between the part of Betty that has confused murder / sex and the part of her which believes these things to be wrong.After she 's seen her boyfriend murdered by the hooded man ... she calls the police , yet is unwilling to give her name . The part of her that thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call , but the part that is ambivalent won 't allow her to admit personal involvement . The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way . So she walks away from the phone in the rain ... and when she 's picked up by the director she 's acting surprisingly calm , not as upset as you would think a " " normal " " person would be ... because the part of her that 's been blocking stuff since she was a child is trying its damnedest to block the horror of what she 's just witnessed.The state of affairs in her life all contribute to an impasse within Betty 's psyche . Her singing career is starting to bear fruit ... she 's going to be a great opera singer like her mother was . But is she going to become like her mother in all ways ? In the darker ways ? Or will she be able to make her own path ? Add this to the re-emergence of the hooded man murdering everyone around her.It 's not until the hooded man kills Daria Nicolodi 's character that Betty really takes an active role in defeating the killer . Here 's someone who loves Betty , who 's supported her wholeheartedly in her emerging career , who is in fact a maternal figure in Betty 's life now since mommy 's dead . Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then to see the woman who is the closest thing you have to a mother get shot through the eyeball.I could go on ... but I won 't . The main gist of what I 'm saying is that the character of Betty is a lot more complex than most of the reviewers on here have been willing to acknowledge.Opera is one of Argento 's best ... and not just for the visuals alone ( although they are truly magnificent ) and not just for the inventive murders ( although they are ) . There is a depth here ... and attention needs to be paid . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Michael Bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father ( the creepy Ray Wise ) at a sprawling , windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young , scheming and seductive stepmother from hell ( the yummy Clare Wren ) , thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family . An edgy , stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to VHS and cable TV--where I first saw it . It is beautifully written , smartly acted , and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails . I cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it .

" It was a rare treat to see " " Checking Out " . " I was touched by the characters , laughed a lot at the wonderful script , and was deeply moved by the genuine emotions magnificently portrayed by this ensemble cast and especially by Peter Falk . In fact , one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children where he tells of his experience of his life , his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life going forward is so profoundly real that it is at the highest level of the best Academy Award-winning performances . He is a consummate actor who out-did himself in this film . The screenwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge , timing , a gift for dialogue and hilarious situations that had me laughing out loud in the theater .

Cut to his son and new girlfriend ( The ships PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true ) on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion . ...... Then the dad is there hugging them . HoW ? ? ? ? Who cares , its magic . There is not one redeeming feature to this film . The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when being chased by the villains there is only One place to hide , you 've guessed it . Enter the villains who , instead of checking under the One table , proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar ( a corner bar in the casino - fantastic ) .

" War drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971 . It follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland--an accurate portrayal of Vietnam on American soil , before they 're shipped over . It focuses on two men--Booz ( Colin Farrell ) and Paxton ( Matthew Davis ) ... how they meet , become friends and deal with a corwardly squadron leader ( Clifton Collins Jr . ) and a borderline psycho ( Shea Wingham ) .A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher . He uses a hand-held camera throughout most of the movie and uses digital video for the combat scenes . It works very well--the film looks gritty ( as it should ) and uncomfortably realistic.Farrell successfully covers up his Irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing Southern accent . His performance is just superb--he 's an extremely talented young man . Davis , unfortunately , is not that good . He 's tall , muscular , very handsome--and very bland . The rest of the cast however is just great.This film was thrown away by its studio . It had no stars in it , a familar story and was considered " " just another war film " .

The rest of the movie is about how tools got control of Man. the strange artifact appears once again to evolve Man to his final stage : the starchild.at 1968 , the year this movie was released , only astronauts had idea of what was out there in space. after this movie , that changed. it 's futurism took 7 years to be explored. the special effects are incredible. they are completely realistic , even today.the directing , along with excellent taste in music , good acting , and the fantastic filmography , makes it an epic.the plot , with its vision of the year 2001 and the evolution of man tools , with an AI psycokiller , with the psycotropical hypnotising end , makes it the trip our lives.if you have never seen this movie , see it. don 't be scared with the lack of dialog , sit back and enjoy. it 's a symphony of evolution. it 's terrific . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they weren 't very funny and had a drama element where Bill ( the mother ) was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didn 't mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped . After that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the BBC have ever made ! The chemistry between Bill and Ben 's character 's were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series . The Christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas . The show came to a stop when the main actor Gary Olsen playing Bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as Up ' n ' Under and a very funny man RIPThis underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesn 't to be repeated that often - Though it does appear on UKTV Gold once in a while but it should be repeated on BBC one or two to show this brilliant Comedy to a new audience , positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you 're tired by the same repetitive , unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases , you 'll enjoy " " You Are Alone " . " It is thought provoking , well shot and riveting.Without revealing anything that you don 't find out in the first few minutes of the movie , this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor . The vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come.Through their discussion , you explore two shifting views of prostitution , depression , loneliness . Yet the movie is not depressing . It talks about dark things without being depressing.As a viewer , your emotions and preconceived notions are moved around , but gently .

" This was one of the highlights of ST : TNG 's semi-forgettable second season , before they ' grew up ' or grew into their own in the third season and beyond . This was not only a showcase for up-and-comers like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher , but was also the continuation of Data 's search for his ' humanity ' , this time through the concept of comedy . Still one of my favorite episodes.On a side-note , I 'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character Okona was about to have a tryst ( after Teri Hatcher 's character ) before being rudely interrupted by Lt Worf .

" Where do I begin ? Walt Disney 's happiest motion picture " " Lady and the Tramp " " is one of , if not possibly , my favourite in the theatrical canon of Disney animation . The sequel , however , is ... to say the very least , enjoyable . I enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie . It was , ( flame-shield up ! ) adorable ! The Broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked , and I was humming the songs for the rest of the night . I can , if you asked me to , still sing all of the songs.But where the movie was ( really ) good for me , it was bad in a lot of other places . The animation was kind of scary at times . Every time there was a close up shot of someones face , I don 't know ... it just seemed scary to me . Also , where the hell was Lady ? She gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs Scamp at the end . She gets 0 % interaction with the plot and her only son ! But all in all , I liked it . Compared to the original does it hold up ? No . The songs aren 't as good ( still kind of catchy though ) , the plot was a lot less involved , Lady had almost nothing to do with it , and it 's not as cute as the first one .

" It was easy to dismiss this film as hyperbole at the time of its release . Fonda , Douglas and Lemmon were known " " lefties " , " but the accident at Three Mle Island provided shocking context to this fictional drama.This film works on many levels , taking shots at both public utilities and TV news . 1979 was the zenith of the infamous " " Happy Talk " " format of TV news ( see also " " Ron Burgundy " " ) and it 's on display here in all its glory . The sonorous anchor grimly reads a story about a " " grinding head-on collision " " before cheerfully introducing Kimberley Wells ( Fonda ) , doing a story about a veterinarian who makes house ( or is that " " aquarium ? " " ) calls . The show 's producer and the station manager argue about content - or lack thereof - behind the scenes.There are a few technical errors . The PR flack ( James Hampton ) shows Fonda and Douglas the requisite scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant , built by Westinghouse . Later , as Lemmon and Wilford Brimley ( nicely playing Lemmon 's friend / colleague , caught between duty and loyalty ) fight a sudden crisis in the plant ' s control room , they 're obviously running a boiling-water plant ( built by GE . ) A small point , but curious , considering how many details the screenwriters got right.Like any good drama , the film asks more questions than it answers . The real-world accident at TMI proves the film 's basic premise . The working title for the film was originally " " Power " , " and you 'll see why . As nuclear power prepares to make a comeback in these days of $ 3 gas , " " The China Syndrome " " is as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Oldboy ' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history.Trusting the latest Hollywood fad , vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent , asexual , love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore . This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past ... well , at least in the second half . ' Thirst ' starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story . The vampire transformation of a priest is , over quite some time , sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story , which makes for some awkward viewing . But the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory . Well , maybe not so surprisingly if you know ' Oldboy ' and ' I 'm a Cyborg but that 's OK ' , but I guess it 's fair to say that ' Thirst ' beats Park 's earlier films in terms of in-your-face violence . All in all , be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick . It may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some . ' Thirst ' is original , entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than Park Chun-wook 's earlier endeavors . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I first saw this movie as a younger child . My sister had told me about it and I thought it would be more of a kid 's movie . However it remains to also be an incredible movie . True that the subject behind the movie is ruff but also true this movie will never stop touching your heart.I was only 6 when I first saw it and just yesterday , 7 years later , I saw it again . For the first time in a long time . Even after I knew how it ended , I knew that I had seen it a billion , bizillion times I wept like a teeny weeny little baby . When I saw it a few years back I finally got the idea and the seriousness of the film . So I stoped watching it for a while . But yesterday I didn 't change the channel , I watched it . By the end I was astonished at how much it still made me laugh , cry , think , and above all , believe in mericals again . I haven 't belived in a long time and this movie got me out of my shell and opened up my heart . This movie wasn 't just impacting . I was also so impressed with the actors . Especially Bobby .

" A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects . Taylan biraderler ( taylan brothers ) had made their first shots on a tv-show a couple of years ago , as far as i know . That was kind of a Turkish X-Files , they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects . This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well . This movie will make you laugh that 's for sure , and as well it might have you scared . It has a nice plot and some young , bright actors in it . If you are a high school student in Turkey you will find so many things about you here .

But the most weired thing is of course his transformation in Simone Choule and the fact , that he doesn쨈t know , who he really is . His halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie . Of course it쨈s all in his mind , but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in - I think that쨈s an interesting question .

The result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of his / her window .

" This is not your typical Indian film . There is some great sense of humanity , and the characters are pretty realistic . There is great dynamism in the interpersonal relationships , and there is a sense of guilt , grief , passion , passivity among the many characters . While seeing this , one gets a feel for the heavy burden of the 5000 years of layers and layers of history of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations . The final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a great footnote to such a ancient civilization , and yet , human relations are still preserved and nurtured . Saw it on DVD , the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting . Was surprised to learn that the movie has not done well ( or not being shown ) in India ( ... but maybe not too surprised ) . The artistic patrimony of rural societies is being slowly lost and its inheritance not picked up by younger generations , as some of the older musicians in the movie are no longer living today .

" Kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals . A journey on the darkest road ever . The road of no return . The plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in California . The man ( David Duchovny in his best role up to now ) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in America and his girl - who is a photographer - is going to take the pictures . So they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way . To share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad . But the couple that answers it is not just ANY couple . It is one of the strangest couples ever . The girl is a naive , frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses . The man is exactly the opposite . A cruel ruthless murderer . We learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to Kalifornia ( not with C as usual , but with K , presumably symbolizing the word killer ) , along his journey of betrayal , murder and finally defeat . All the leads , Duchovny , Pitt , Lewis and Forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star . The photography is amazing , with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie , and the music suits the dark character of the film . On the whole this is a really good movie . Don 't miss it .

" I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater.We have all seen this plot line before ( Top Gun , GI Jane , An Officer and a Gentleman ) but a good script still works . This story is basically about the training of a Coast Guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines . Kevin Costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader , Ben Randall , who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission . The movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the Costner character and that of Jake Fischer , played by Ashton Kutcher . I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this part.There are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives . However , the use of humor , the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching Ben Randall " " do his own thing as a trainer " , " kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained .

" Well , I get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that don 't reflect my experience at all . To me , Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies . He was a die-hard villain , a no-apologies villain . To me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isn 't sort of undercut in some way.The kid who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast . There I think maybe the director could have done better . But , to be honest , the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel . She is an unsung heroine , a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered . But I must say I appreciated her contribution greatly as she played Virendra Sahi 's wife . She may be given little to do , but she does everything with total conviction . I 'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience.So if you are in a habit for settling for Bollywood average , you won 't get much out of this movie .

He is a tough , bad guy and an Aryan on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be . This show has many murders , I think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show , but I have to admit that is one of the reasons why I think the show is so great.I think some characters were killed off a little early , but some sure still made their mark . You can 't compare things like Prison Break to this show , they are totally different . I think some of the actors on the show are also very good and underrated and should what is due to them . A great show , my favorite 's . A show that should be considered of the the greats for years to come . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of Fuller 's ( a combat veteran himself ) early works of average quality , but accurately hits on the many conflicting aspects of life in postwar Germany . The main character starts the movie in Apr ' 45 as a Sgt with C Co , 157th Inf , 45th Div , which really did end the war in Munich as in the movie . ( Same unit in the previous month had fought heavily in Aschaffenburg and then liberated part of the Dachau facility ) . To the uninformed the movie may seem confusing by flip flopping between showing the good & bad of the german people . But anyone who has been there or at least well read on it would know that most of what is portrayed in the movie are things that really did happen in 45-47 Germany . The only inaccuracy I noticed was minor : while on a boat cruise of the Rhine passing the remains of the Remagen bridge he comments he crossed there . But his unit really crossed well south of there - north of Worms Germany . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Just re-saw this movie after thirty seven years . I was eleven years old and caught this flick on South Beach at the long gone Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue . In 1969 , I thought Where it 's At ! was a very good movie . Now , however , after almost forty years , it 's not as good as it was . Times have changed , and this movie is now a tired old re-hash of the war between the generations . It did however , catch a place in time which is just a memory . It 's really interesting to see the mod fashions , the old Vegas , a slim Don Rickles , chain smoking , and a hip opening song . The acting was decent , the script somewhat out-dated , but the memories were still fresh . Where it 's At , may not be where it 's at for you , but for me , it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory lane . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Caught this movie on TV and I watched it again . I said to myself , it 's been a long time since I watched this movie , so why not . And once again this movie thrilled me . It is so easy , so watchable and so human that I don 't know why some people dislike it . John Travolta shines as Michael ( his dance and every move ) , angel that can hardly be related to this word . He smokes , drinks and he eats like some savage , but he 's got big heart . On his way Michael helps all people he meets . Dorothy Winters ( Andie MacDowell ) in her singing and finding a right man . Frank Quinlan ( William Hurt ) in developing himself as a good and decent man . Michael even helped dear old Pansy Milbank ( Jean Stapleton ) - that last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street.Travolta had great help in other actors . Andie MacDowell is so beautiful and likable , William Hurt is great as usual , late Robert Pastorelli shows his talent . Jean Stapleton and Teri Garr are also good , but my favorite supporting actor in this movie is Bob Hoskins as the tabloid owner.So we 've got here a solid movie about people with a warm story also and attractive cast . Just don 't take this movie seriously and I can guarantee you 'll have fun . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Trey Parker and Matt Stone , the creators of South Park , finally get out of their grueling schedule to talk to the cameras while sipping champagne in their hot tub . At first , when watching this , I did not sense as much sarcasm as there was in this . I knew they were joking when they would complain about different actors on the show and when Trey said he wasn 't going to give his mother any of his money , but there is so much sarcasm throughout , that this documentary , is more of a mockumentary full of inside jokes.This " " documentary " " shows everything about South Park ( up until the second season anyways ) . It shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording . It has interviews , many of which are fake interviews , but some , amongst all the fabrications , give insight into the show . Clips from both of Trey Parker 's Spirit of Christmas shorts are shown , as are many good clips from the show . If you were a South Park fan , then this should have quenched your thirst for show knowledge back in late 1998 when this was made . Now , obviously the show has changed , but this is still interesting.What we have here is an amusing documentary where Trey Parker ( especially ) and Matt Stone come off as arrogant jerks , and that 's exactly what they wanted to come off as . They may be this way in real life , but here it was a joke , a 51 minute long insightful joke.My rating : * * * out of * * * * . 51 mins . Not rated , contains Language and Sexual Content . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw Beyond Rangoon about 20 times , it was THAT GOOD . At first when I watched it , I saw the story of Laura Bowman , but later , after multiple showings , I realised that this also was a parallel documentary . It came to be in my mind , a story about Aung San Suu Kyi , and the struggles of women to remain strong in the face of uncertainty , danger , and sadness . I also would put history , and politics on the list after further viewing , since I did learn a lot about Burma 's past , and present , and could only guess at it 's future . This movie is not only one you will want to see , it 's also one you will definitely want to own a copy of . It 's a movie that could easily been seen by the whole family , although not for children under thirteen . However , the educational benefits of this movie can not , and should not be understated . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" John Wayne 's first starring role just blew me away . Televised letterbox style on AMC , I had to check and make sure I had the right date . Sure enough , this 1930 film was made using a 55 mm wide-screen process . Aside from that , it features some of the grittiest , most realistic footage of the trek west I 've seen . Wagons , men and animals are really lowered down a cliff face by rope . Trees are chopped by burly men -- and burly women -- so the train can move another 10 feet . The Indians are not the " " pretty boy " " city slickers who portrayed them later ; they 're the real deal . A river crossing in a driving rain storm is so realistic , it has to be real ( In fact , I understand that director Raoul Walsh nearly lost the entire cast during this sequence ) . I could smell the wet canvas . Each day is an agony . The various sub-plots are forgettable but the film as a whole is not . I can 't think of another title that can beat The Big Trail in evoking a sense of living history on the trail to Oregon . Bravo . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I really liked this movie ... it was cute . I enjoyed it , but if you didn 't , that is your fault . Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew , even though she isn 't quite like the books . The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times , but she looks good on them . To me , the rich girls didn 't have outfits that made them look rich . I mean , it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together . All of the outfits were tacky , especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits . I do not want to make the movie look bad , because it definitely wasn 't ! Just go to the theater and watch it ! ! ! You will enjoy it ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What an overlooked 80 's soundtrack . I imagine John Travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was 80s cheese . Clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls , bartenders and immature relationships were in style . The best was his lousy Texas accent . Compare that to Friday Night Lights.I suggest watching Cocktail and Stir Crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film . Also , as a side note Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is an awesomely bad movie . I was so shocked to realize I had never watched it . One more weird movie of this genre would have to include Cadilac Man with Robin Williams . Just remember all of these BIG stars played big roles in these CHEESY movies .. Tom Cruise , Richard Pryor , Robin Williams and John Travolta , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it . Then I went home and watched it with subtitles and I loved it . I am ready to watch it again.I am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian ? The scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent mindedly forgets to be meek are my favortites.Of course the martial arts are stunning . There is really not much I can say about them if you are familiar with the HK style . However , if you are not ... we paused playback briefly and Walker , Texas Ranger was on .

" The history of the FBI , as told from the point of view of Agent Stewart via flashbacks , interwoven with his personal life story . Stewart and Miles ( as his wife ) are pretty good , as is Hamilton as an earnest agent . The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved . It 's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who 's who cast of gangsters . Some of the episodes are too long , some too short , and some just look out of place ( Stewart 's daughter 's school sequence ) . Overall , it goes on way too long . Nevertheless , it 's worth a look for its handsome production values . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during World War I. The dialog is highly entertaining , and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as the ship 's cook , " " Ptomaine " . " Walter Huston 's character is inspiring as the captain of the submarine , a stellar example of an officer and a gentleman . One of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes . I was surprised at how similar the technology of World War I was to the technology displayed 25 years later in World War II . Basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times , and far from the conservativism I thought existed in the so-called " " innocent " " past . All in all I felt that the cast , characters , action scenes , and view of history depicted in this movie were first-rate . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I recently saw this movie in my International Business class . I was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary ( not to say I don 't love documentary I 've just hard bad luck with movies in that class ) Imagine my surprise when this movie , that 's actually a movie , came up . This film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere . The culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call . I would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh , because yes it is funny . Well , that 's about it ! Cheers , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing , with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright ( yet volatile ) lights of Broadway filled with typically na챦ve optimism . Of course , their first attempt fails and Kermit ( leader of the group and author of the show ) blows his top ; so , the others all go their separate ways so that he won 't have to feel responsible for them . Kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father 's diner ( the old man , then , has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs ! ) . We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars : Art Carney ( as a producer ) , James Coco ( as an overzealous dog owner ) , Dabney Coleman ( as a confidence trickster ) , Elliott Gould ( who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [ 1979 ] ) , Gregory Hines , Liza Minnelli ( as herself 혯 having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by Kermit 's , sporting fake moustache , as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the Muppets ' show ) , Brooke Shields , and even director John Landis ( in possibly the film 's funniest scene as a Broadway producer before whom Kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an Afro wig ! ) . The other Muppets more or less go through their typical paces , with ( regrettably ) less space given to Gonzo this time around ; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me , the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermit 's romance with the waitress 혯 and especially her violent reaction to this 혯 are undeniably funny . What disappoints , however , is the climactic show itself ( after a fairly redundant midsection wherein Kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on Madison Avenue ) which , rather than the expected splashy routines , procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Diary of Anne Frank is the second best-selling nonfiction book in the world , and for good reason . Nonetheless , sitting through this documentary about her life , which fills in some of the details where the diary left off , I thought , " " Just another documentary about Anne Frank . " " I found it to be competent but not extraordinary . That was my complacent attitude because I was already well aware of the story of Anne Frank ; most of what the documentary had to tell me wasn 't news to me.Everything changed , though , when I got to the end of the documentary---when I saw the motion picture footage of Anne Frank . The emotional impact of seeing this footage , only a second or so long , made everything that came before it a thousand times more real---but not just everything that was in the documentary ; everything I had previously known about Anne Frank suddenly became more real to me , more personal . I 'd always been moved by her story , but when I saw that footage , what I felt was stronger and deeper and more profound than any other film experience of my life . ( I knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of Anne Frank , and I 'd even seen the footage in a movie review on television , but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience . It 's not likely that my mentioning it here will spoil it for anyone . ) I realize now that many people still don 't know the story of Anne Frank ; it 's discouraging at times to be witness to this kind of ignorance . I think to myself , " " How could someone NOT know the story of Anne Frank ? " " This being the case , though , ANNE FRANK : REMEMBERED , along with reading her diary , is the best place to start . It 's a story that everyone should know . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I enjoyed this film yet hated it because I wanted to help this guy ! I am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business ... who are now still trying to become adults .... no more fans , groupies , money etc ... and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life ... as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight ... it is almost like they have to begin anew ... this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70 's and 80 's are going through now .... and that 's where I find the film sad and depressing.BUT it portrays the life of an old rock star-abandoned and lost-in a believable way.The young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of Hollis maclaren ( Outrageous ) ... and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for . This film is a must have for folks in their 50 's who have seen the rise and fall of bands , people who knew the members , and have watched them hurt as age creeps in , and popularity fades.This is an almost perfect movie .... sad but in a way positive .... because of the whales .

" STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning Mr Bean ( Rowan Atkinson ) is in this world , but not of this world . His mind simply doesn 't seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this , getting himself into constant mishaps and far out , zany situations , which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesn 't seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks . But he never gives up and , despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him , applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the end.To look at the sorry state of modern British humour , with all it 's focus of sex and general vulgarity , you 'd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr Bean was made at one time . There 's nothing unsuitable going on here , just good , clean U rated humour of the type Tommy Cooper and the like made in the 50s . And I find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early 20s as I did when I was a young boy in the early 90s.Although I can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye . There must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him . As others have noted , it looks like he may have a type of autism . In fact I 'm so convinced about it that I really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him , I think Mr Bean could be the first famous , fictional character to be diagnosed with something like Asperger 's Syndrome.If you 'd like to see some truly hilarious British humour at it 's very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity , then this would come highly recommended . Shows like Little Britain do work because it 's well realised but it 's really just as vulgar as the rest . Shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once , and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon . * * * * * , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas . Can 't say much about this film without giving away the story .

" I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the charm , 1940 's quaintness , and good old fashioned romance and it 's hilarious , to boot ! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking \ home life articles for a famous magazine ... under the premise that she is a married homemaker . Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion . Enter a handsome GI , ( played by the talented Dennis Morgan ) just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy . His simple wish is to stay at the homey Inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home-cooked meals . She now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputation ... add to this that her fianc챕 is in a hurry to tie the knot doesn 't help . The humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun . Throw in the character-actor nicknamed " " Cuddles " " ( who fits this name completely ) it becomes even more adorable . This has become my must-see movie that I snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each Christmas season .

" I remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of Disney . This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I have been looking for it . I would have to say that out of all the kids movies I saw back then , , this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once , I really hoped I would get to see it again . The story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory . To this day , I never did see it after that day back in the 70s , in fact , I never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me .

You couldn 't ask for more.Cast is superb . Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife . She 's both wanton , and criminally conspiratorial . Every fellow 's dream . K 'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence , and somehow succeeding . He 's a genuine screen presence . Very photogenic , and natural . Without naming them all , the rest of the cast is wonderful . Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it 's his everyday persona . Billy Connolly is delightful as Fido . A fine actor : I wish that he had played the title role in " " Braveheart , " " with Gibson directing . My sense is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the actual character . His Fido is contained , yet accessible . A nice touch.In short , a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals , values , social pinnings , feelings , growth , coping in uncertain times , and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions .

" An unexpected pleasure as I had heard nothing about this film.Shameful since it warrants having a wider audience.A wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told , although admittedly predictable in its resolution . Solidly acted by the principals . Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film.My recent foray into Chinese film ( Shower , The Road Home , Not One Less ) has been an exciting one that I hope to continue exploring . China and its people is an amazing canvas for film-makers . " " The King of Masks " " can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent Chinese film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When Melville 's " " Pierre ; or The Ambiguities " " hit bookstores in 1852 , his first publication since " " Moby Dick " " a year earlier , the public response was similar to that found among the IMDB reviews of " " POLA X " . " Newspapers even published headlines like : " " Melville Insane ! " " which , of course , he wasn 't . But , when one compares the writing styles found in " " Moby Dick " " and " " Pierre , " " one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former . Clearly , he was mimicking the overly florid style of the now-forgotten Victorian Romances that were easily outselling his immortal " " Moby Dick . " " He was not content , however , to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted , and that surely would have sold . His version of a Victorian romance was a twisted , cynical one , perhaps , but brilliant in its synthesis . The alternate title : " " The ambiguities " " is quite appropriate . As Pierre searches for , and thinks he finds , truth , we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe . As he searches for happiness , he becomes more and more miserable . " " POLA X " " is a fascinating adaptation of this novel , set in modern or nearly modern France . Though , in some ways , it leaves little to the imagination , and shows us graphically the incestuous relations that Melville could only hint at , the ambiguities which make the novel and its message so alluring are perfectly in tact . The questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask , yet the answers are left to the viewer.I recommend a reading of the novel , which is much shorter than " " Moby Dick , " " before seeing this movie . I hope more people discover this tantalizing film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" More than twenty years before Peter Jackson 's visionary adaptation of The Lord Of The Rings , there was this 1978 animated effort from director Ralph Bakshi . An ambitious and reasonably faithful version of the story , this has sadly been rather over-shadowed by the Jackson trilogy . Indeed , many reviewers here on the IMDb ( mainly those who saw the newer version first ) seem to be fiercely unkind to this version .... but if one applies a little common sense , and takes into consideration the time when it was made and the technical possibilities that existed at that time , then they will realise that this is a pretty good film . Indeed , it was shortly after seeing this animated movie back in the early ' 80s that I sought out Tolkien 's book and immediately became a lifelong fan of these richly detailed Middle Earth adventures . So , in some respects , I owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film which shaped my literary tastes forever.Sauron , the Dark Lord of Middle Earth , forges an all-powerful ring that gives him incredible power . Following a great battle during which Sauron is defeated , the ring falls into possession of a king named Isildur혚. but instead of destroying it he foolishly chooses to keep it . For centuries the ring passes from hand to hand , eventually coming into the possession of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins who lives in a peace-loving community known as The Shire . Frodo learns from a wizard named Gandalf that his ring is in fact The One Ring , the very same that was forged by Sauron all those centuries ago , and that its master is once again searching for it in order to restore his dark power over the entire land . Frodo embarks on a perilous journey to protect the ring with three other hobbit companions , but every step of the way they are hunted by Sauron 's ring-wraiths , the Black Riders . There follow many adventures , during which a company of nine adventurers is formed to guide the ring to the only place where it can be " " unmade " " 혯 Mount Doom , in the land of Mordor . The film concludes with Frodo and his best friend Sam on the borders of Mordor , closing ever nearer to their horrifying destination . Meanwhile Gandalf and the other members of the company fight off a huge army of orcs at the legendary fortress of Helm 's Deep.This version covers just over half of the original book . A second instalment was planned to bring the story to an end , but was sadly never completed . While the ending feels abrupt , it does at least end at a sensible point in the story . One has to feel a little frustration and regret that no sequel exists in which we might follow these animated heroes to their eventual goal . The animation is passable , with a nice variety of locales and characters presented in interesting detail . The music by Leonard Rosenman is suitably stirring and fits in appropriately with the epic narrative . The voice-overs are decent , too , especially John Hurt as Aragorn and Peter Woodthorpe as Gollum . On the other hand , Michael Scholes - who provides the voice for Sam - is rather campy and goofy , which is not well suited to the character . The Lord Of The Rings is a commendable attempt to visualise the staggering book on which it is based . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of the more lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed , quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice . The final sequence , with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted Poncelet committed and his own execution are just superb.No , what about the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon ?

" A country-boy Aussie-Rules player ( Mat ) goes to the city the night before an all-important AFL trial match , where he is to be picked up by his cousin . And then things go wrong.His no-hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan-shark / drug-dealer Tiny ( who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively Australian ) . Needless to say , Mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos , and it isn 't long before thoughts of tomorrow 's match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night 's frantic events unravel.Accomplished Western Australian professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country-boy Mat , and successfully plays a part well below his age . Best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny , and an entertaining role by David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events .

" Okay , I 'll admit the casting in the film is REALLY strange--part of this is due to the plot , but I still had a bit of trouble believing Pierce Brosnan playing this lead ( though he really did a pretty good job ) .It 's based on a true story of an Englishman who went to live with the Canadian Indians in the early 20th century . He claimed to be a mixed blood Indian . He was , in fact , so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness treks--even though he was not a mixed blood Indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked ! The movie centers on this and what occurred when the hoax was uncovered.The acting and settings were great and I really liked the film ( once I suspended disbelief about Brosnan ) . It didn 't get widespread distribution--probably because it was pretty cerebral--not a Bond film nor a romance--just a really odd film about a remarkable man . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
River 's edge is not a PLEASANT film to watch but it is an incredible one . Having viewed it many years ago I truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something . Perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie . Given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing . Very well acted and just UNPLEASANT at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film . Should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools .

" In a year of pretentious muck like " " Synecdoche , New York " " a film born out of Charlie Kaufman 's own self-indulgence , comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important .

It traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic , REAL Brooklyn world . The people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the " " mumblecore " " movement . They are real people , painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses , unwilling to change , unable . The real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch , it is very difficult to watch . It is 16mm film-making without proper light , money or any of the other factors that would make a film " " slick " , " but its honesty can not be understated , a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for Richard Linklater to give it an award as he did at SXSW . This does remind of films like " " Naked " " or the best of the " " mumblecore " . " It is a film that is not for everyone , but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film played in Lexington KY for 7 days . I saw it on the last day of its run & regretted that I could not recommend it to others because this is a film that cries out for the big screen experience . The aerial shot where the crowded ship pulls away from the equally crowded dock is a masterpiece as is the scene where the two lead characters flirt on deck--almost a ballet and sexier in its suggestiveness than so many more explicit films these days . I just cringe to think that more people won 't have the opportunity to see this fine film in a theater ; the DVD experience will not be the same . Here 's an idea : if you live in a college town , see if you can lobby for it to show up in a campus film festival . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Gosha 's last great film of the 1960 's . A resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose to his films , Gosha teamed up with Shintaro Katsu ( of Zatoichi fame ) to produce this scathing indictment of mindless nationalist loyalty . " " Tenchu " " ( heavenly judgment ) is the word that the loyalists to the emperor yell while assassinating enemies or " " traitors " " to the cause . Katsu plays up his character ' simple minded allegiance to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride . Anybody who questions the politician is labeled a " " traitor " " and becomes an assassination target.One of the best photographed films ever , many shots are incredible compositions of form , color and light . The fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal . The blood becomes a part of the color palette Gosha uses for his images . Gorgeous and disturbing . While the personal story is simple to follow , the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in Japan would be very helpful you can struggle through the film without it . The few drawbacks to the film are the music track , the length and Katsu 's occasional scenery chewing . He has a drunken scene that 's way over the top for a film but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk.Downbeat but one of the great chambara films . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Usually , I start my reviews with an explanation of how and why I watched the film I 'm reviewing . With this , I simply cannot explain . I needed to be awake early for work the next day so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a film that I didn 't know anything about . But something kept me glued to my comfy futon as I watched this Heather Graham vehicle . Oh , that 's right . Boredom.Graham plays Joline , a bohemian nut-case who seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the guy she married ( played by Luke Wilson ) . When her hubby decides to set off in search of better things ( work , women and scripts , presumably ) , Joline begins a fanatical quest to find her husband and free him from his " " spiritual wheelchair " . " It sounds like I 'm making this up but sadly , I 'm not . In reality , this is little more than an acting exercise for Graham as she gamely gives this Phoebe-from-Friends role a work-out . Oh and Goran " " ER " " Visnjic is in there as well , for some reason.The TV schedules had this down as a comedy but I failed to find a single laugh anywhere . It struck me that this was a personal journey for Lisa Krueger ( the director and writer ) , in the same mould as " " Girl , Interrupted " " but even that had more laughs than this . Graham 's character is simply too self-centred for the audience to care about and I felt sorry for the hen-pecked husband as he bravely fought for his freedom from his clearly mental wife . Very little of this film made sense as characters simply appeared in the story as though they were standing around , waiting for Graham to turn up like the extras in " " The Truman Show " . " In fact , the only positive note I can produce from my scribblings was " " Heather Graham - nice baps " . " And that wasn 't because I was too tired to enjoy the film.In truth , it 's very difficult to think of anybody to recommend this film to . Graham purists ( a VERY small number of overall movie-goers , I think you 'll agree ) will have to be committed to watch this dross and possibly hippy students who collect American Indian dream-catchers will take something from this . I was amazed that the average rating ( at time of writing ) was 5.0 - that would make this film as good as " " Die Another Day " " and " " Gothika " " in my book and that simply ain 't right . " " Committed " " is a quirky oddball mess of a movie that neither entertains or enlightens . It 's complicated , pointless and simply too boring for my tastes and probably yours too . Don 't even think about watching this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The acting- fantastic . The story- amazing . The script- wonderful.Just a few ways to describe this movie . Yes , it 's slow and it has mostly talking , but the whole story of all of their lives and how it 's told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story . I , myself , am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie . I 'm also to read the Exectioner 's Song , which is the ' other ' half of the Gilmore story . This movie made me think so much about the phrase " " piering into the other side of the looking glass " . " You hear a song in the movie called Gary Gilmore 's Eyes , which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what it 'd be like to have Gary Gilmore 's eyes ( which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died ) and as you listen to it , which is after the last time Mikal ever sees Gary , you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself . This movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others . I recommend this movie ( and the book ) very very much . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My abiding love of Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi , who helped jump-start my puberty with her performance in 1965 's " " Thunderball , " " has led me to some fairly unusual places . Case in point , this British curiosity from 1959 , " " Carlton-Browne of the F.O. , " " which features Lucianna in one of her earlier roles . She plays a princess in this one , although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers , both of whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point . In this cute , often very funny film , we learn of the Madeira-like island nation of Gaillardia , which had been a British colony until 1916 and then universally forgotten . Forty-three years later , however , it becomes the center of worldwide attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there , and Her Majesty sends the bumbling Carlton-Browne of the Foreign Office to take charge . Terry-Thomas underplays this part nicely , as does Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulos of the tiny country . ( This was Sellers ' second film of 1959 concerning a tiny country matching wits with the world , the other being " " The Mouse That Roared , " " of course . ) Ian Bannen almost steals the show here as Gaillardia 's suave king , and my girl Lucianna is as appealing as can be in her minor role . The film exhibits much in the way of very dry humor , although there ARE some belly laughs to be had ( the reception at the Gaillardian airport , for example , and especially that May Day-style parade of Gaillardian strength ) . And Sellers ' seedy prime minister , with his cracked English and seemingly perpetual sweat stains , is yet another memorable character in this great actor 's pantheon . Despite the occasional instance or two of indecipherable , stiff-upper-lip British gibberish , I found this picture to be a winningly modest entertainment , and well presented on this crisp-looking Anchor Bay DVD . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really enjoy this movie . The first time it was on Turner Classic Movies . All the actors did very well but Brynner steals the show again like always ( he is so sexy ! ) .This is one of the movie that you do see Brynner 's emotions . Actually this movie this is the first I ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong , larger-than-life and serious roles in other movies . In this movie you see both a masculine , tough and sensitive side of Brynner .Brynner seems to be a " " ladies 'man " " in this movie.That is amazing how Brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian tongue it drives me crazy in love . I don 't understand when both Brynner and Kerr ( they both have very good chemistry ) stars in a movie together and then Brynner always die at the end it kind of reminds you " " The King and I " " in a way . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There is a lot of crap coming out of Hollywood lately.A friend , sends me movies now and again , as a surprise , it 's awesome.I turned it on and couldn 't stop watching , it is a drama , but with a odd twist . Imagine if Romeo , as in Shakepeare , had a super power . It is sad and poetic at the same time . Hollywood should take notice of the new Russian cinema , they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi . It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story , without a spectacle . This is a lot like an Asian film with a dark Russian twist . Granted it 's not perfect , but nothing ever is . You know what the power is but it is never explained , nor totally realized until the end . It becomes secondary to the emotion of the story . I don 't want to see a remake , it is too cool as is , the Hollywood system would , as usual , mess it up . Acting is top notch all around . Directing and Camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there . Kudos to all involved , and I will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic .

" I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist ( Barbara Stanwyck ) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home . The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas Holidays . Why is she worried ? Because she lives in a small New York apartment , isn 't married , and doesn 't have a baby - and can 't cook at all ! Hilarity ( and romance ) ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face / keep from being fired by the magazine owner ( played by Sydney Greenstreet ) .

" " " National Velvet " " tells the story of Velvet Brown , a young English girl with dreams of entering her beloved horse into competition at the prestigious Grand National horse race . The film follows her as she trains her horse with the aid of a former jockey and the support of her parents.While " " National Velvet " " is a family film that fact shouldn 't deter anyone who typically views such films with derision . The film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family , not just attention-addled youngsters . It even managed to land five Oscar nominations , hardly a sign of slacking off for a general audience.Anne Revere , in the part of Velvet 's mother , actually won an Oscar for her performance . She was indeed excellent in the role but it is 12-year old Elizabeth Taylor who steals the show . She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years . Also on board are Oscar-winner Donald Crisp as Velvet 's father , Mickey Rooney as former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury ( in one of her earliest film roles ) as Velvet 's older sister.The film 's lustrous Technicolor makes for an attractive viewing experience while the editing secured the second of the film 's two Oscars . Additionally , the film was nominated for its direction ( by Clarence Brown ) , cinematography & art direction . The score by ten-time Oscar nominee Herbert Stothart is also worth mentioning , though it went unnominated.All in all , " " National Velvet " " is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating . I realize that the prospect of watching a film about a girl and her horse isn 't exactly going to thrill some people but this one is worth taking a chance on . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Don 't characters need real feelings , real emotions , and the ability to feel real pain ? Well , they do in this movie .

" I found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian ( Chris Rock ) who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid-50 's white mans body . He doesn 't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before . He listens to rap music , sings along , and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man .

" I 'm a big horror film buff , particularly of the 1980 's subgenres . Name one 혯 I 've probably seen it . Last year , a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under mainstream radar called " " Saw " " was about to hit theaters . I was moderately excited . Having not heard anything about it , I thought it looked quite promising judging by the previews and posters ( well , except the back and white ones with the severed hands and feet ... those just looked terrible ! ) I saw the film on opening night . It was one of the worst experiences of my life . This movie was literally mentally and psychically painful to watch . Because it was scary ? ... NO ! Because it was one of the most awful movies I had ever had the displeasure of seeing ! First off , the construction of the screenplay and editing was utterly atrocious , even by horror movie standards . Starting off a sequence in an interrogation room with a victim ( Shawnee Smith ) who recently survived a serial killer 's attack , then showing a flashback of what she survived ? NOT SCARY ! It was impossible to feel any type of tension WHATSOEVER knowing that the aforementioned victim was perfectly alright . Sure , that reverse-bear-trap thing was creepy ... but WHY should I feel in the least bit frightened when CLEARLY , you just showed me she survived the ordeal ? Unfortunately , the entire film was constructed this way . It starts with two guys in a cellar . Then , they show flashbacks of how they were abducted ... NOT SCARY ! Why ? Because we already know what 's gonna happen to them , seeing as how we JUST SAW the result of the attack . THEY 'RE FINE ! Move on with the story ! Even more unfortunately , the actual story was meager at best . I couldn 't have cared less for these annoying , pitiful excuses for " " characters " " and the acting didn 't help . Cary Elwes was solid for the most part and then suddenly towards the end he started crying like a lost infant while straining to keep his American accent in tact ( it didn 't work 혯 the audience I saw this with was in stitches ) . This drove him to a rash and idiotic decision even the most simple-minded wouldn 't attempt . He had other options . Better ones . SMARTER ONES . Even given his intense emotional state ( horribly communicated through horrible acting ) , it was still irrational . I didn 't buy it . BAD WRITING ALERT ! Furthermore , even when certain sequences were played straight-through and flashback-free , they were painfully predictable . I constantly found my foot tapping impatiently waiting for the dumb sequence to end . This happened for the entire film . I saw every single " " twist " " coming . Twenty minutes into the film , I had already called the killer 's identity , not to mention his connection to his " " accomplice ( s ) " " as SOON as they appeared on screen . Better acting might 've been able to overshadow the awful script . Instead , the actors might as well have had " " RED-HERRING " " or " " ACCOMPLICE " " tattooed across their foreheads.By the end of the movie , I was utterly outraged I had wasted even a fragment of my life on this film , and the entire theatre was laughing hysterically at the downright horrendous finale . Seriously , you 'd think they were watching a Monty Python movie . I would 've been laughing too , had I not been so angered at the film 's total and utter failure to accomplish ANYTHING it set out to do . When we left , there was ( no joke ) a line to speak to the manager of the theatre to get their money back ( didn 't happen ) . I was absolutely positive the movie was going to be a box-office bomb . The following week , you couldn 't have imagined my shock to find out " " Saw " " had hit number one at the box office and EVERYONE was talking about it ( mostly individuals who found " " Napoleon Dynamite " " to be a thought-provoking epic tale and thought " " satire " " was some type of rubber ) . I am so utterly sickened to hear people praise this film that I often feel as though I 'm going to vomit . It 's entertainment for the most feeble and simple-minded of the human race . Those who find some weird Jigsaw clown-puppet riding on a tricycle threatening ( it 's a doll 혯 knock it over and leave 혯 what 's so frightening about that ? ) .Don 't get me wrong , I own every " " Friday the 13th " , " love my splatter movies , thought " " Napoleon Dynamite " " was hilarious , can 't get enough of Freddy , Michael , Pinhead , or Leatherface , have a font appreciation for unknown horror gems and rank " " Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers " " amongst my Top 10 Favorite Slashers . However , I realize these films aren 't the most sophisticated American cinema has to offer 혯 I appreciate them for what they are 혯 quick , easy fun . " " Saw " " is cinematic garbage . The film attempts to be a smart and semi-sophisticated , nasty little thrill ride , and bogs down to an irritating , annoying waste of time , money , energy , and celluloid . Atrocious on all accounts . Every single copy should be incinerated , along with its feeble-minded fans . Shame on all of you.Will I see " " Saw II " " ? Maybe after I take a double-shot of Liquid Drano before I gouge out my own eyes and impale white-hot shish-kabob brochettes into my ears and colon . My Rating : 0 / 10 .

" This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as what the Child 's Play movie were like , but this can get really funny and enjoyable , Chucky 's laughs are hilarious .

" For the very reason that I love movies such as " " Central do Brasil " " ( " " Central Station " , " 1998 ) , I really love " " Chop Shop " . " There is no sugar-coating , there is no attempt to make these people 's lives over to something more palatable or pretty . What you see is what you get , and that is often gritty and at times heartbreaking . But that is exactly what makes a movie such as " " Chop Shop " " so wonderful , alongside the fact that the storyline unfolds so elegantly and subtly . For a young brother and sister , who are about as close to homelessness as one would ever want to get , working ( and living ) at an auto body repair shop in Queens , New York is as good as it gets . Is this a good or bad thing ? That is the question this movie essentially poses to the viewer . This movie is really a fantastic slice-of-life piece that at times feels like a documentary instead of a drama , and that is a great thing , because it looks and feels so real . In the midst of so , so many current movies based on essentially surreal and often implausible plots , stumbling upon " " Chop Shop " " is like finding a little gem . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

However , after a hectic working day , she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform . As she races off on a situation taking her from one daunting encounter to the next , however , she learns of something far more malign and evil waiting for her out there.In a lot of ways , the British Film Industry is really becoming one on it 's own , especially in the horror thriller department , with films such as Creep and the successful 28 Days Later ( which this has strong echoes of in parts . ) In terms of succeeding in what it set out to do , Creep does cleverly create ( especially at the beginning ) a scary sense of isolation and tense fear . At it 's clever running time , it also ( though inadvertently , I suspect ) manages to pay homage to some of those pioneer high-concept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear through-out without really focusing too much on character development and such.Of it 's weaknesses , some scenes are a little predictable , but these don 't really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way . I 'm not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and it 's not exactly perfect , but it 's certainly very effective and serves it 's basic function very well . * * * , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The apolitical musicians Eva ( Liv Ullmann ) and Jan Rosenberg ( Max von Sydow ) have been married for seven years and live in a small farm in a remote island to escape from a civil war in the continent . They provide lingenberry to a couple of costumers to raise some money and buy some supplies . They love each other and Eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby but the reluctant Jan , who is a weak and sensitive man , does not want to have children . When the rebels arrive in the island , their peaceful and calm lives turn to hell , and they get in the middle of accusations from both sides . When Colonel Jacobi ( Gunnar Bj철rnstrand ) stalks Eva , Jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man , and the love and affection they feel for each other change to hatred and indifference . " " Shame " " is an antiwar movie by the master Ingmar Bergman focused by the eyes of a couple of artists that are apolitical and does not listen to the news , but when the war arrives to their lands , they have their love , friendship and affection destroyed by the senseless soldiers . Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow have top-notch performances as usual and I do not recall seeing the breast of Liv Ullmann in any other movie . The process of brutalization of the pacific and sensitive Jan Rosenberg by the war is impressive and the bleak open conclusion is pessimist and adequate to the dramatic story .

" An under-appreciated , unseen gem . Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant , heartbreaking fashion , the tension that arises between a son who 's been to hell and back , and his parents , who can 't begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind . It 's not unlike Born on the Fourth of July , in that it deals with a soldiers ' emotional and mental breakdown after serving in Vietnam , but while that one focused more on the politics of post-Vietnam ( anti-war speeches , etc . ) , this one deals with a much more personal topic : Family . One man 's struggle to return to normalcy after a life-altering experience , and his parents ' failure to see the change that has occurred.Estevez delivers a smoldering performance as Jeremy Collier . You can sense the pain and frustration bubbling beneath surface . There to match him inch for inch is his real-life father , Martin Sheen . It 's a trip watching these two act off of each other , as you get the sense that they 're constantly trying to one-up one another . It 's like the presence of each other inspired the pair to do their best , and their performances triumph because of it.Recommended to anyone who appreciates solid acting , writing and directing . And to any Vietnam war buff . * * * * / * * * * * ( 8 / 10 ) , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Had it not been for To Kill A Mockingbird , this movie would be much more famous . Had it not been for Gregory Peck as Addicus Fitch , the acting here would be much more lauded . Had it not been for William Faulkner , perhaps To Kill a Mockingbird might never have been written in his shadow.I found this movie to be sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies , To Kill a Mockingbird , may not have been as original as I 'd always thought it was . Perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie . Oh , the " " whodunnit " " is different , but the underlying story , a lone righteous " " white " " attorney against a white Southern town defending a Black man is all too familiar . And , written by a woman , Mockingbird concentrates on rape , the ultimate betrayal to a woman while this movie concentrates on brother against brother hatred , the rape a man feels by fraternal betrayal.There 's not the depth of Mockingbird here . Not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence . So you 're just left with the sadness that , whether she intended to lift the plot from this movie or not , Harper Lee 's Mockingbird reflects . Nothing changed in that 10 or so years since the time she may have read Faulkner 's book and saw his movie while in college in Alabama and unconsciously or not took most of it as her own in later years . Nothing changed in race relations and some may say nothing has changed even now , these many years later.It 's all too sadly familiar , and one wishes there were an Addicus of our day to make it all right . Where Mockingbird leaves you with hope of that , rocking in the arms of Addicus and waiting for a morning of better times , this movie leaves you just sad that pride from Black people might equal or better the pride of White people . But pride from either is no answer at all.Rather , it 's the answer of Addicus we need , comfort that we are all flawed and that in our frailty we should have mercy , not pride , when facing each other in our differences . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" There 's a lot going on in The College Girl Murders . A mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas . Before he can reap the rewards of his discovery , the scientist is killed by a hooded , whip-welding monk . After a co-ed is killed in a church by the gas , Scotland Yard is called in to investigate , but the killing continues . Who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college ? What Works : - The Killer . What 's not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red KKK looking outfit , complete with red gloves . The white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown . Although the idea of a killer in a flaming red , pointy-head outfit sneaking around a girl 's school is fairly far-fetched , it 's one of the more sinister looking costumes I 've seen.- Groovy 60s Music . I really would like to track down the title music to The College Girl Murders . It 's got a jazzy , hip , 60s feel to it that I just loved.- Bizarre Touches . Beyond the killer 's red gown and hood , the movie features a sliding fireplace , a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead , poison spraying bibles , a strategically placed mannequin , mini-skirts , go-go boots , and mile high hair . I would describe it as a cross between the 60s Batman TV show and an Italian giallo . The College Girl Murders is a real treat for the eye.- The End . Let 's just say that there are more twists than a mountain road . Just when you think the killer has been uncovered , here comes a twist혚 .. and another혚.and another혚and another.What Doesn 't Work : - Chief Inspector Sir John . I know the guy was meant to be comic relief , but his buffoonish character has way too much screen time.- Why Have Alligators ? Previously , I mentioned the alligators in the pit . And while they are a nice touch , they serve very little purpose . Why go through all the trouble and not use them ? - Plodding Plot . Some of The College Girl Murders has no flow or rhythm to it . There are far too many moments throughout the movie when things come inexplicably to a screeching halt . Better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable movie.I haven 't seen many of these German krimis but of the few I have seen ( Phantom of Soho , Strangler of Blackmoor Castle , Dead Eyes of London ) this may be my favorite . This one has a real funky feel to it that I really go into . Had the plot flowed a little better , I could have easily given The College Girl Murders a 7 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Some have compared this film to Deliverance . I believe Of Mice and Men is more appropriate . Our leading man , Heaton , definitely loves Spike .

" Then you must see this film , to understand the reality . Having read the book , Ms. Duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with bipolar disorder ; formerly labeled manic-depression.It is hard to believe that in this day and age , people still critique others with emotional problems , or those who seek psychiatric help . Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists , and this is unfortunate.In this film , the audience sees the pain and suffering Ms. Duke had been through , especially as a child . Many of us may remember her from the teenage " " Patty Duke Show " . " She was a household name in America by age 15.You learn of her exploitation by the Ross ' ( well played by Howard Hesseman ) . As she was growing up in the 1950 's , the stigma was in full-force . However , we see as she advances in her career , yet the illness becomes worse . She goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity ; even marries someone whom she divorces the next week ; and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother . All these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy , and medication.A recent survey released by NAMI ( National Alliance on Mental Illness ) recorded that a majority of US adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder . It also was released that one in five respondents to the poll believed that people could CONTROL their illness without medication if they wanted to . ( bp Magazine , Winter 2006 ) If you watch this film , you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not " " pull herself up by her bootstraps " " and " " get well " " until she was educated about her disorder , and received proper treatment .

" If you were ever a fan of MTV " " s " " The State , " " then these three guys will be familiar to you . But even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like I did , you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy.Born out of their stand up comedy trio , ' Stella ' , Michael Ian Black , Michael Showalter and David Wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to display at their shows , and now after being available only to download from two websites , they appear in pristine glory on one DVD.Think comedy sketch show sans censorship , and you 'd be halfway there . No stone of decency is left unturned . But for those who like their comedy rude , self-indulgent and bordering on puerile , ( and I mean that in the most flattering way ) this is the DVD for you ! I think it 's worth the money for the commentary from the two Michaels and David alone , you can 't help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions , cringe at their own antics with sex toys and by turn pat each other on the back and hurl abuse.Fantastic.It must say something for the appeal of Stella that the likes of Julie Bowen and Paul Rudd are willing to throw themselves into the action so fearlessly . And you should follow their fine example , throw preconceptions to the wind , and prepare to laugh yourself sick . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " If I sit down I will never stand up again " , " that 's what the mother ( the one of the title ) says to his son when he tells her to get some rest ( she 's just widowed ) . He means that resting is what a woman of his age and in her situation has to do : to rest in peace , to neglect herself . But she 's not in the mood for " " resting " , " not yet . She also has a daughter who reproaches her for each and every disasters in her life ... Suddenly , the revelation comes : sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her ( Daniel Craig , the brand new James Bond ) when she " " thought nobody would ever touch her again " . " It is a story that makes you reflect on many things , specially on what 's a 60 something woman is supposed to do with her life when his husband dies . It doesn 't look that we 've advanced that such in those aspects . I mean , nobody 's surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it was otherwise ? An old woman , a young guy ... nah , you ain 't ready for that , are you ? The movie has intimist tones all along its length , except for 2 or 3 sequences in which that tones breaks and out comes some explicit and foul-mouthed dialogs . Those vulgar touches and the way the son and the daughter find out their mother 's love affair ( pretty absurd -you 'll know what I mean when you watch it- ) are the only discordant elements in " " The Mother " .

This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the subsiquent court case that follows . What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife.The star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along .

" To most of us , life is an unfolding process of love . For others like Soo-mi , however , it is dominated by darkness and fear . Based on the Korean folk tale Jangha and Hongryun , Kim Ji-woon 's brilliant Gothic horror story A Tale of Two Sisters revolves around two sisters , Soo-mi ( Lim Su-jeong ) , and Soo-yeon ( Mun Geon-yeong ) , who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy Victorian-style mansion . Feeling alienated from the world , they cling to each other for survival with the older Soo-mi obsessively protecting the younger Soo-yeon against danger . For Soo-mi , however , not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mother 's death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality.While we may recognize staples such as haunted houses with apparitional sightings , doors that open and close on their own , a cruel and overbearing stepmother , and other events of high strangeness , A Tale of Two Sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge . Soo-mi says " " Do you know what 's really scary ? You want to forget something . Totally wipe it off your mind . But you never can . It can 't go away , you see . And ... and it follows you around like a ghost . " " There is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel . The plot cannot be summarized , only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjective.In the film 's opening , Soo-mi , an obviously disturbed young woman , is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution . When the doctor asks her to describe what happened " " that day " , " the film flashes back to when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to the home of their father Moo-hyeon ( Kim Kap-su ) and stepmother Eun-joo ( Yum Jung-ah ) . The stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi who is really hurting . As the girls try to readjust , they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house , which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrences.Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her and oozes black blood , a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions , a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters , people mysteriously disappear from photographs , and many other maniacal schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling on the edge of insanity . While we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone 's mind , we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged , at least until an important clue is offered in the film 's second half.Shot in gorgeous low-light cinematography , A Tale of Two Sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the scares , and there are plenty . It is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to . While the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light , it shows us where we can end up if we opt for the darkness . In the words of a wise observer , " " Blame is never the answer - whether it is blaming yourself or others . Rather , the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely - both of yourself AND others . Forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing . " " , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" CitizenX ( 1995 ) is the developing world 's answer to Silence of the Lambs . Where ' Silence ' terrorized our peace of mind , ' Citizen ' exhausts and saddens us instead . This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates rather well , thanks to a Westernized friendship between two Rostov cops who become equals.CitizenX may also argue against ( ! ) the death penalty far better than Kevin Spacey 's The Life of David Gayle ( 2002 ) .Humans are Machiavellian mammals , under which lie limbic brains ( lizard-logic ) . Why did two kids , who knew better , stone to death a toddler they kidnapped ? Why do bloodthirsty women yell ' li-lilililililii ' at acts of OBSCENE terrorism ? -My own term for this is ' limbic domination ' , the lizard-logic urge to dominate an ' enemy ' . If you have the words ' enemy ' / ' vengeance ' in your vocabulary , you 're easily capable of ' limbic domination ' .In WWII-devastated 1980s Rostov ( located at the mouth of the Don river near the Black Sea ) , nothing suppressed Andrei Chikatilo 's urge for ' limbic domination ' from overpowering his layers of civilization . Chikatilo ( Jeffrey DeMunn ) ' s easy victims were paupers , usually children , who rode the interurban train for fun , since they couldn 't afford anything else.CitizenX reminds us that the denials of a rampant Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such ' lambs ' . Rostov 's serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years AFTER the police arrested and let him go.The politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere . Although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world , in the west , vote-grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter-agency rivalries , stymieing a more coordinated response to crime . In the Soviet Union of CitizenX , however , Viktor Burakov ( Stephen Rea ) ' s Killer Department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy.Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychosexually inadequate Chikatilo with faultless but understated authority--to the point of complete obscurity . In real life , too , Chikatilo had a lifetime 's experience blending in and evading capture.His pursuer , on the other hand , sticks out as a strange bird , given to unheralded , naive outbursts . Perhaps by design , Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief Burakov . Rea 's Russian accent is impenetrable ; and his Burakov is humourless and sullen , at odds with everyone.So it 's Donald Sutherland who walks away with the picture . Sutherland 's Col.Fetisov , Burakov 's boss , and at first his only supporter , is an overly restrained , patient Militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations . His reawakening as a logic-driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film 's cornerstone idealism.Joss Ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik , Secretary of Communist Ideology Bondarchuk , overseeing the investigation . Naturally , he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect , a Communist , in 1984 , a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag , supposedly going home : Andrei Chikatilo.Soon , he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik , Detective Gorbunov ( John Wood ) , insisting that the investigation now focus on ' known homosexuals ' . The funniest scene of this sad , sad film comes during Bondarchuk 's & Gorbunov 's institutionalized harassment : one stupid cop earnestly reports , ' As I suspected , comrade , it 's fornication . I 've made some drawings ' --cue howling laughter.5yrs after the bodies began piling up , in 1987 , the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles . The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr Aleksandr Bukhanovsky ( Max Von Sydow ) , who termed the UNSUB ' CitizenX ' . He later also observed to Fetisov & Burakov that ' ... together you make a wonderful person ' . We concur.The drawn-out pace , spread over a decade , perfectly captures the institutional inertia of Glasnost-- ' openness ' --that wasn 't . The contrast with Perestroika-- ' restructuring ' --couldn 't've been greater for the case . Although Chikatilo was still prowling railway stations , police plans were about to bear fruit.In 1990 , Col.Fetisov was expeditiously promoted to General . His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared off the scene , allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference . Staff , communications , publicity--suddenly all were available . In just one night of telephoning around , Fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the FBI 's Serial Murder Task Force at Quantico , where , Fetisov discovered , staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators.Fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief , now ' Colonel ' Burakov , of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie 's powerhouse watershed scene . Fetisov 's is the most tender apology I 've ever seen on film : ' Privately , I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife . I hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance ' , he almost whispers.A HBO production , CitizenX is a film of the highest caliber . Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak ( shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest ) , but Randy Edelman 's soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming--and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality . Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits.Chikatilo 's actual murders are depicted as bleak , aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world . This makes the murders seem not-entirely-out-of-place--but of course they were . As President Kennedy reminded us , ' we all cherish the futures of our children ' .CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply . Serial rapists rape to dominate ; serial killers kill to dominate . So do some soldiers . Such ' limbic dominators ' make poor humans.WARNING-SPOILER : ----------------------------------------------- The real Andrei Chikatilo WAS the world 's most prolific known serial killer . Convicted , he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all Soviet Union death sentences : one shot , in the back of the head . Foolishly , such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death.Conclusion : ------------------------------------------------------------ The best outcome is always the prevention of killings , not their prosecution . Executions merely guarantee society 's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims ' deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of HOW / WHY they died . Nor do killers learn regret if they 're dead.Vengeance doesn 't unkill victims . Baying for the killer 's blood constitutes nothing better than counter-domination--once it 's too late.Vengeance on behalf of the grieving isn 't justice for the deceased--it 's appeasement of the living .

" While I agree this was a 1950s sitcom , I don 't feel it was " " typical " . " Firstly , Donna Reed was a STRONG woman , unlike the regular 50s sitcom moms . She made a stand for women 's worth and equality ( remember the episode where the TV announcer says " " just a housewife " " ) and Donna stands up for all women do and represent , especially those that don 't work outside the home ? And when the women rebelled against something in the series , it was not something trivial ... it was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men . Remember , Donna Reed was married to the show 's producer , so she had much more input into making hers a more powerful character.The children were intelligent , but not precocious . They were normal kids . And they could ACT.Something else that made Donna Reed Show stand out was not only did the children LOOK like their parents , but you could feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real life situation , which then came out in the characters . Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson have often written and remarked that they were treated like the children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz , and that the adults were fiercely protective of the child actors , and treated them accordingly . Donna and Alex also had somewhat of a sexual chemistry that wasn 't seen on the other family shows . And the characters could be flawed , and in major ways , and yet , accepted for the flaws and mistakes . These were not super parents that did no wrong and had no emotional highs and lows . They were normal people acting as normal people.Women 's rights , drug abuse , child abuse , single fathers , poverty , children who need good health care but can 't afford it ... it was all shown on this show . Pretty groundbreaking for the era.Donna Reed show didn 't last for eight years without a reason . And it could have possibly endured , had it not been for Tony Owens and Donna Reed divorcing.This show is highly underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate quality.In summary , I agree with the original poster , who obviously cares for the show , but I think that the Donna Reed show has SO much more to offer than casual entertainment . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" There is a lot to like in this film , despite its humble trappings of a preachy PC tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim . The movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes . ( I , for one , was sure it was the teacher . In fact , that would have been more probable plot-wise because the idea of the best-friend 's boy-friend kind of came out of nowhere . I guess the point of that is that " " rape is omnipresent . You never know who it is going to be " . " ) Ms. Beller is luminous as always ( yet see KB discussion board for my qualification of this statement ) . Like all preachy films the plot lasts 15 minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point . Unless you are really curious to find out what happens to Phillip . Blythe Danner , as the mom , is in the role she was born to play : the fretting , over-protective mom . Some good 70s scenes for 70s fans .

" The college teacher Larry Donner ( Billy Cristal ) is a blocked writer since his former wife Margareth ( Kate Mulgrew ) ruined him , stealing his novel that became a best-seller . He does not hide his hatred for Margareth , upsetting his girlfriend Beth Ryan ( Kim Greist ) , who is an anthropologist teacher in the same college . While giving classes of Creative Writing , he is stalked by the student Owen ( Danny DeVito ) that wants to know his opinion about his crime tale . Larry tells that he did not like it , and explains that in every mystery tale , the murderer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi , otherwise he would get caught . Further , Larry suggests Owen to watch Hitchcock 's movies to understand the structure of a suspenseful story . Owen , who wants to kill his detestable mother ( Anne Ramsey ) , watches " " Strangers on a Train " " and misunderstands Larry 's advice , believing that his teacher wants to swap murders to eliminate the motive . Owen travels to Hawaii and while in a ship , Margareth falls overboard vanishing in the sea and is considered dead . However , Larry does not have an alibi and becomes the prime suspect , while the deranged Owen presses him to kill his mother as part of their supposed deal . " " Throw Momma from the Train " " is one of the funniest comedies of the 80 's and a great tribute to Alfred Hitchcock . The direct reference is " " Strangers on a Train " , " but there are jokes with " " Vertigo " " ( with the spinning camera ) , " " Family Plot " " ( with the car without breaks ) and other movies . The lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when Larry tells that every great romance or mystery has a train . Anne Ramsey is amazing in the role of a nasty and abusive dominating mother and the viewer will certainly feel sorrow and understand the insanity of Owen . Kim Greist is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch . Billy Cristal performs an obsessed character with many silly and unreasonable attitudes but necessary to the plot .

" Thirty years after its initial release , the third version of " " A Star Is Born " " finally comes to DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand . That would include me since I just saw her in concert singing among other numbers , the feminist anthem " " Woman in the Moon " " from this 1976 film . Easy to dismiss , the movie 's career-polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of Hollywood-style clich챕s that variations of it exist in other films including Streisand 's own " " Funny Girl " . " This time reset to the then-contemporary music scene , the timeworn plot follows self-destructive rock star John Norman Howard on his deep-dive career descent just as he meets club singer Esther Hoffman who is awaiting her big break.Troubles dog their courtship from the outset , as John Norman ( both names please ) responds to grasping fans and bloodless DJs with random acts of violence ( from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution ) . To John Norman , Esther represents his last shot at happiness , and in turn , she is drawn to the innately decent , creative musician underneath the fa챌ade . In the movie 's most pivotal scene , he gives Esther her big break at a benefit concert , and her career takes off . Inevitably , he can 't handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success , and if you are familiar with any version of this story , you know the rest . Directed by Frank Pierson ( although Streisand 's budding directorial talents are obviously on display ) , the film still manages to draw me in , even though I know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative . It still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws.Although Streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star , her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play Esther credibly . The same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer Adult Contemporary-oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock . From the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the Oreos , she can 't help but come across as an established star . I can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent , but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes Esther more strident than poignant when John Norman 's woes become overwhelming . This creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than Esther 's response to it . This is capped off by an uninterrupted eight-minute close-up of her memorial performance - great except when she regrettably mimics John Norman 's style toward the end.Kristofferson , on the other hand , gives a superb performance throughout , managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love , pride and resentment toward Esther . He makes his vodka-soaked onstage growling work within this context . Otherwise , what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn 't exist unless they were interacting with the two principals . The only ones who register are Paul Mazursky as John Norman 's level-headed manager Brian and Gary Busey as his cynical band manager Bobbie . Veteran cameraman Robert Surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print . A big seller in its day , the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970 's - some songs still quite good ( " " Everything " , " " " Woman in the Moon " , " " " Watch Closely Now " " ) , some that have moved to kitsch ( " " Queen Bee " , " Kenny Loggins ' " " I Believe in Love " " ) and of course , the inescapable " " Evergreen " . " The print transfer on the 2006 DVD is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering . Streisand 's participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature-length commentary . She gives insightful information about the genesis of the film , the casting and the reportedly troubled production . She is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of Jon Peters , her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie 's producer , and her dissatisfaction with Pierson as a director . I just wish she could have provided more scene-specific comments that directly relate to what is on screen . She also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her , e.g. , it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of Peters . I think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her.There is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970 's clothes , especially Kristofferson 's mixed-fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt . There are also twelve deleted scenes included with Streisand 's optional commentary . One is a comic bread-baking scene which reminded me how much I like Streisand in farcical comedies . Another is an extended scene in which she plays " " Evergreen " " on the guitar in front of an awestruck Kristofferson who then falls asleep . The most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts , which I agree with Streisand should have been used . Fittingly , the theatrical trailers for all three versions of " " A Star Is Born " " are also included . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I 'm Czech and soldiers ( not only pilots ) who escaped Czechoslovakia after Nazi 's invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and bravest men in our history for me . This movie from director of Academy Award winner " " Kolya " " ( 1996 ) is a tribute to these men . It 's first big-screen movie about Czechoslovak WWII soldiers since " " Nebesti jezdci " " ( 1968 ) . I think " " Dark Blue World " " is a good movie - good acting , good special effects , nice music etc . Movie is half in English and some actors are Britons . But greatest thing about this movie is it 's pure existence . It 's great chance to show people all around the world ( and to many people in Czech Republic too ... ) that Czechoslovak role in WWII was not only as occupied country but as an active member of allied campaign.Leading characters are older and wiser Frantisek and young Karel . They escaped together from Czechoslovakia , they are flying in the same squadron and they fell in love with the same woman ... Maybe it 's a clich챕 but fortunately this storyline is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes ( including great dogfights ) . I don 't want to compare " " Dark Blue World " " with " " Pearl Harbor " , " someone will like PH more and someone will like DBW . But if you like happy ends , DBW is not for you . So , I think it 's very good movie for everyone who likes this type of stories and very good movie who wants to get to know something about this chapter of Czechoslovak history.BTW , main theme " " Dark Blue World " " is from Czech 30 's and 40 's composer Jaroslav Jezek . He wrote this theme when he lost his eyes ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I rented this movie , but I wasn 't too sure what to expect of it . I was very glad to find that it 's about the best Brazilian movie I 've ever seen . The story is rather odd and simple , and above all , extremely original . We have Antonio , who is a young man living in Nordestina , a town in the middle of nowhere in the north east of Brazil , and who is deeply in love with Karina . The main conflict between the two is that , while Antonio loves his little town and has no wish to leave it , Karina wants to see the world and resents the place . As a prove of his love for her , he decides to go out himself and bring the world to her . He 'll put Nordestina in the map , as he says . And the way he does it is unbelievable . This is a good movie ; might be a bit stagy for some people due to its different editing job , but I think that it 's also that that improves the story . It 's just fun , and it makes you feel good . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * * * May Contain Spoilers * * * OK , it wasn 't exactly as good as expected in fact it was a lot different than I had thought it would be but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie.I usually don 't care too much for that type of music but in this movie it worked perfectly ( I mean duh he 's a rock star ) but anyway I loved Stuart Townsend in this , and Aaliyah , although she had a small part in the movie was amazing.And even though Tom Cruise played Lestat in the Interview with a Vampire , I have to admit that I am glad he turned down the role even though I normally hate when they use different people to play the same characters in like sequels and stuff.Overall , the movie was great and I enjoyed watching it , even if there were parts that could have been better . Great vampire movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" That Certain Thing is the story of a gold digger ( Viola Dana ) from a tenement house . Her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers , but they are a loving family . Although Dana 's character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor , she refuses and holds out for a millionaire . Everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy , but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire , son of the owner of the popular ABC restaurant chain . The two marry hastily , but the girl 's dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger . However , she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own.A rare glimpse of movie star Viola Dana , this film is a lot of fun . Dana 's role is accessible , natural , and entertaining . She displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama.The mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too . The camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility . The title cards are also incredibly clever.If you like films like My Best Girl , It , or The Patsy , you will enjoy this film . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When you look at Mexico 's best movies you will more than likely find that the Photography was performed by Gabriel Figueroa . He is recognized in the world as one of the best that have ever existed . His master control of the cameras gave an added asset to the movies he was part of . If added to his participation we add the direction of Luis Bunuel , you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world . This story , Nazarin , was written by Spain 's greatest writer besides Miguel de Cervantes ( Don Quijote de la Mancha ) . The story in itself is superb : Nazarin a priest that lives by his beliefs tries to live a very Christian life , but as always there are people that do not accept this . He wanders through many places preaching his Christianity but finding , most of the time , people that do not accept him . But besides the splendid story , it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that Bunuel sends us throughout the picture in scenes that make you shiver . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This was a pretty good movie that was overall done quite well . The idea about Mercy ( won 't spoil ) was original also . I think Angelina did a good job as one of her first movies .

" The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old . I remember loving it and everything about it . 13 years later , I am now 17 , and decided to watch it about a month ago because I am taking a 1960 's class in school . I didn 't really know what to expect , since it had been 13 years since I last saw it , but I was completely blown away by it . The actors were amazing , the music was so fun , and I now find myself singing along to every song . Treat Williams is great as Berger , the " " leader " " of the hippie group , who always gets what he wants , one way or another ( except for at the very end , of course ) . John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude , the Oklahoma draftee who falls in love with Sheila ( Beverly D 'Angelo ) . D 'Angelo is lovely as the prim and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies . The other hippies are played by Annie Golden , Don Dacus , and Dorsey Wright . Annie Golden is just adorable as Jeannie , the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child . Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud , the other two members of the group , and Cheryl Barnes , who plays Hud 's fianc챕e , has an amazing voice . The only problem I have with this movie , however , is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing . They are barely ever shown together , and when they are , they fight ( remember the skinny dipping scene ? ) . It seems as though their relationship is very weak , and by the end of the movie we are supposed to believe they are madly in love , only based on the few meetings they had . I also see that many people writing reviews here are upset by the PG rating this movie has . I personally would raise the rating up to a PG-13 , only because there is some drug use ... but remember in 1979 , PG-13 didn 't exist . I don 't think the nudity is bad at all , it is in no way sexual ( in fact , there isn 't really any sex at all in this movie ) , and it is only to show the childlike innocence that the group maintains . In most European countries , nudity isn 't regarded as something bad , and I don 't see why it is here in the US . Anyways , I give this movie a high rating , and I 'm glad it was made back then , because in the insanely " " politically correct " " world of today , they wouldn 't even think of making it , and even if they did , it would be a very " " watered down " " version , and I 'm sure you wouldn 't get the full effect . In conclusion , this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking out . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My first impression would be this is Beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting Grendel and dragons intact , making it one thrill ride from start to end . Written by Frederic Lanoir and Arthur Qwak , the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story , with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around , which can either be wastelands , or globes of greenery.The story 's a simple one , which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon 's unwanted visit to plunder and destroy , and the resident knights have all but been annihilated . Enter the king 's granddaughter Zoe ( Marie Drion ) who gathers Lian-Chu ( Vincent Lindon ) , a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant , and his partner-in-arms Gwizdo ( Patrick Timsit ) , who balances the partnership with his cunning brain . Lian-Chu and Gwizdo ( together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires ) share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement , but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free , hence their career in monster-extermination which doesn 't exactly pay off.That 's basically the whole gist of it , but what makes this film a spectacle , is its CG graphics , which is solidly rich , detailed , and an eye-popping marvel to behold . It has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action , , and during those fight sequences , there 's nary a boring moment . Photo-realistic moments of non-existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make-belief , and it 's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three-suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs ( here 's having at you George ! ) And I couldn 't get enough of the finale battle as well , though the usual brick-bats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle characters.I guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer-animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of Pixar 's . And this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of Zodiac : The Race Begins and Legend of the Sea can learn from 혯 to keep the story effectively simple , and let your moving artwork do all the talking . Definitely highly recommended ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was never all that impressed by Night Gallery , but this one episode stands out.A TV network executive auditions an odd act - a young , nerdy boy who proceeds to make prognostications .

Facing imminent showtime , everyone 's at wit 's end , even threatening him with legal action if he doesn 't fulfill his contract and make his daily predictions.The young boy relents , and foretells a seemingly utopian tomorrow.After the show , the befuddled executive asks for an explanation , only to learn why the complete truth is too terrifying to reveal . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Based on actual events of 1905 , silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an Imperial Russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny . Shocked by conditions on the ship , citizens of the port city Odessa rally to the mutineers ' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of Imperial forces , who attack the civilian supporters with savage force.POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members , and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences . Amazingly , each of these sequences manage to top the previous one , and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen 's rally to the massacre on the Odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history . Filming largely where the real events actually occurred , director Eisenstein 's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film.To describe POTEMKIN as a great film is something of an understatement . It is an absolute essential , an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form , purely visual cinema at its most brilliant , often imitated , seldom equaled , never bested.Gary F. Taylor , aka GFT , Amazon Reviewer , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Great film about an American G.I. who quits the army to marry a German girl who saved his life in the last days of the war . She accepts , but does she do it because she really likes him , or because he can support her with easier access to food and such ? Meanwhile , her brother and an old friend form an anti-American terrorist group called the Werewolves , their purpose to drive away the occupants ( you might remember the same group playing a major part in Lars von Trier 's film Europa ( Zentropa ) ) . James Best , best known for his role as Roscoe P. Coltrane in the 1980s television show The Dukes of Hazzard , is shockingly excellent as the American . He should have become a big movie star 혯 at this age he reminds me very much of Warren Beatty . The other main actors are good , as well . Fuller 's direction is quite good , using a lot of long takes again ( although they are not nearly as complex as they were in Park Row ; the long takes more often than not consist of long scenes with a lot of dialogue ) . The only problems lie in the script , as seems to be the case with all of the Fuller films that I 've seen . It 's not too badly flawed , but it ought to have been expanded , fleshing out major characters and parts of the script . Helga , the wife , goes through a major change , but completely off screen . Therefore , the emotional center rests squarely on Best 's shoulders . Fuller also should have killed off the sick mother early in the film . I hope that doesn 't sound too harsh ! She just doesn 't really do anything throughout the film except lie in bed . She has so few lines . But Fuller keeps bringing her up as the film goes on . I would have had her death solidify David and Helga 's relationship myself . And the film ends too abruptly , and it lacks payoff . These aren 't really the biggest flaws in the world ( the way I described them makes them sound bigger than they are ) . 9 / 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a kid , I loved this game . I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew . I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored . Then Streets of Rage 2 came out . And we quickly forgot that this one even existed.You play as ex-cops Axel Stone , Adam or Blaze Fielding , who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way . There are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X. Beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun . Level 4 ( The Bridge ) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river . You even have the chance to become Mr. X 's right hand man at the end of the game ( at a price ) . This leads to the ' bad ending ' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate . Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr. X , but never mind.Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music . The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis . The main theme , Level One , Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes . As a Wii owner I am proud to have this forever on my console . But with Streets of Rage 2 also available , it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.Pros : Average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game.Great tunes.Easy to get into and hard to put down.Cons : Vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2.Poor enemy AI . Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat . This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss.Lack of combo moves.Lack of decent weapons.Bad guy models are repeated far too often.Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Lasting Appeal B- , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The sound was lousy , it was too bright to see the screen properly - but I still enjoyed myself immensely . The names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor : Smsix , Abba , Vikea ...

Some very good jokes , but also some that not everybody seemed to get.The only thing I didn 't like were the voices of Ast챕rix and Ob챕lix , in the German version at least . The voice actors are very well-known around here , which was the only reason they were casted , really .

" An ultra-modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre ( and deadly ) behavior . Or at least that is what Lara Flynn Boyle 's character , Col Kennedy , argues . After a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door , Col knows something has got to give . Mark-Paul Gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect.My opinion : The House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the locations ( beautiful house ) and stylish sets . Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress , not to mention absolutely stunning . She brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing . Without her , it would have failed . " " It 's so alive " " declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house . Yes , it is alive . But the story itself is not so much.Barring Boyle 's presence , not much is happening here , as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners . The results are predictable . But I liked it anyway . The cinematography lends the film a polished look . 8 / 10 on account of Boyle , the premise of an evil ultra-modern house , the locations and cinematography , and set decoration and wardrobe . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Originally I rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer - and I was not disappointed that way ( except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes ) . As a dad I suppose I was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays ( as uncomfortable as I feel with the topic ) . In a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices . This dilemma is introduced by a young British-born teen girl - Jasminder ( Jess ) - of east-Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer . The pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore ( in a nice way ) her hopes and fears for her future . The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess 's frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships . In SUMMARY , the soccer scenes are GREAT ( lots to learn in slowmo ) and while I didn 't need the storyline - something was needed to keep the movie going . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Hatred of a Minute " " is arguably one of the better films to come out of Michigan in recent years . Not to say that it 's a brilliant film by any means , but it 's definitely worth a watch . " " Hatred " " chronicles the sordid adventures of Eric Seaver ( played by director Kallio ) , a formerly abused child now grown up , and starting to listen to his evil side . " " Hatred " " is very nice visually . The shots are creative , and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at . This film actually has an element of production value to it , unlike other recent Michigan releases like " " Dark Tomorrow " " and " " Biker Zombies . " " Subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film 's $ 350,000 budget . However , " " Hatred " " stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do , and that 's in the story and character department . Essentially , things just kind-of happen . Eric Seaver doesn 't evolve at all . Basically , he 's always been crazy , it 's just that people are starting to notice . The film just wanders along its merry way with very little development . Also , the ending is very abrupt . However- since this is a horror film , since when do we care about plot ? We just want to see people die , and " " Hatred " " certainly delivers . As the body count mounted , people in the theater started cheering " " Kill her ! Kill em ' all ! " " When people scream back at the screen , it 's always fun .

" I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier . It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas.The story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville , FL , murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim 's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced.About half the footage is of the trial ; it 's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers ( two public defenders ) explaining their case , interviewing witnesses , and visiting key locations .

" THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is one of the sweetest and most feel-good romantic comedies ever made . There 's just no getting around that , and it 's hard to actually put one 's feeling for this film into words . It 's not one of those films that tries too hard , nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end . In fact , all its charm is innate , contained within the characters and the setting and the plot ... which is highly believable to boot . It 's easy to think that such a love story , as beautiful as any other ever told , * could * happen to you ... a feeling you don 't often get from other romantic comedies , however sweet and heart-warming they may be . Alfred Kralik ( James Stewart ) and Clara Novak ( Margaret Sullavan ) don 't have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop ( Matuschek & Co . ) he 's been working in for the past nine years , asking for a job . They clash from the very beginning , mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it 's opened--he thinks it 's a ludicrous idea ; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired . Their bickering takes them through the next six months , even as they both ( unconsciously , of course ! ) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through PO Box 237 . This would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on , except that THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is expertly fleshed-out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters , from the fatherly but lonely Hugo Matuschek ( Frank Morgan ) himself , who learns that his shop really is his home ; Pirovitch ( Felix Bressart ) , Kralik 's sidekick and friend who always skitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion ; smarmy pimp-du-jour Vadas ( Joseph Schildkraut ) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous Kralik ; and ambitious errand boy Pepi Katona ( William Tracy ) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for Matuschek & Co . The unpretentious love story between ' Dear Friends ' is played out in this little shop in Budapest , Hungary , in which Kralik 's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds-to-be along . It 's nice that everyone gets a story in this film ; the supporting characters are well-developed , and Matuschek 's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one Alfred and Clara share . His invitation to new errand boy Rudy ( Charles Smith ) for Christmas Eve dinner , made in the whirling , beautiful snow of a Hungarian winter , makes the audience glad that he is not alone ; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isn 't this film 's business to tell . Aside from the love story , I must say that James Stewart is truly one of the best things about this film . He doesn 't play the full-fledged Jimmy Stewart persona in this film ( c / f ' Mr Smith Goes To Washington ' for that ) ; in fact Alfred Kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind . He 's rather a brusque man , in fact , with little hint ( until , perhaps , the very end ) of the aw-shucks down-home boyish charm Stewart would soon come to patent . When he finds out before Clara that they have been corresponding in secret , in fact , Kralik doesn 't ' fess up--he waits it out to see how far he can take the charade , especially since he quickly realises ( given his stormy relationship with Clara as boss and underling ) that loving the person he knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself . His description to Clara of the fictional Matthias Popkin ( what a name ! ) who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme , but also his way of proving that the letters don 't reveal all there is to a man , just as her letters don 't reveal all there is to her . Stewart plays this role perfectly--he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever Clara insults Mr. Kralik , as she is often wont to do , even ( and especially ) to his face . And yet one believes , underneath the brusqueness and professionalism , that he * could * reveal his identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer * hope * as he eventually does . Special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well . Margaret Sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film , but she really comes into her own in the closing-shop scene on Christmas Eve , when she almost gets her heart broken again by Alfred 's most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart . Frank Morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous Hugo Matuschek driven to nervous breakdown , the man who has to rediscover his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to ' grow old with him ' . And Felix Bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal Pirovitch wonderfully ( a Lubitsch regular , since he appears as a hilarious Russian ambassador in NINOTCHKA ) --of particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend Alfred get the Christmas present the latter * really * wants ... a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box Clara is so hung up on . Ernst Lubitsch really does himself proud with this film--for example , the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the Matuschek shop is well worth the effort , right down to the Hungarian names on the door , the wares and the cash register and so on . But even though Lubitsch chose to have the story set in Hungary , the setting is actually universal : it could happen anywhere ; it could happen to you . Therein lies the charm of this simple story , these believable characters who really * are * people . The snow on Christmas Eve is real as well , or at least as real as Lubitsch could make it ( he had snow machines brought in at great expense ) . It is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable , that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated . ( No , not even in a remake like YOU 'VE GOT MAIL . ) * This * is really the Jimmy Stewart Christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about IT 'S A WONDERFUL LIFE . Not to detract from the merits of that other film , but there 'd be no harm , and in fact a lot of good , done in watching THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER this Christmas instead . It 's sweet , funny , charming , and Stewart is impeccable in his role . We should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film ; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I first saw this film on video in a department store ... it intrigued me .

" For a low budget project , the Film was a success . The story is interesting , and the actors were convincing . Eva Longoria , who now stars on the TV Show " " Dragnet , " " is sexier than ever .

Of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes , but the music keeps this script moving .

" Let 's get some things straight first : Zombies don 't exist so the filmmaker can have them WALK , RUN , hell even FLY if he wants to . That 's what makes this original Zombie movie so good . Everything they did was so damn original . I hate it when filmmakers do everything like Romero or when fan boys expect everything like Romero . Some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical Romero movie , once again zombies don 't exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants . The zombies in this movie all look very good but OBVIOUSLY they are not decaying corpses since they JUST freaking died ! They are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood . One of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat . It looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it . This movie got really good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue so that made me want to go see it . I 'm glad I listened .

" I just saw this movie for the first time last night . Wow ! What a movie ! This is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to see because its just so cool and so interesting.I do not want to give a single word about the plot because I think it would be better for people to go in cold . DO NOT READ THE PLOT SUMMARY before you see the movie ! All I 'm going to say is that Eastwood , Malkovich , Peterson , and the screenplay by Jeff Maguire are top notch . I wish all thrillers were more like this one . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sergei Eisenstein 's most famous movie has truly withstood the test of time . The story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 does have the feeling of Soviet propaganda , but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt . The scene on the Odessa steps should remain seared into anyone 's mind.Okay , so " " The Battleship Potemkin " " wasn 't actually the first movie to use montage , but they did a great job with it here . Certainly any film history class should show this movie . It 's a great historical drama ( although I will admit that I don 't know how accurate it is ) . A 10 / 10.Oh , and we should have learned by now that " " Potemkin " " should be transliterated as " " Potyomkin " . " , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Low budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star , becomes one and then finds it all a bit too much . Good cast and a sense of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have all been here before . Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O 'Connor 's voice sounds a lot like Mini Mouse ! She disappeared from sight soon after making this movie - so life can imitated art ! A must see if you want to see a punk version of a Star Is Born though . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be wildly missing the point here . This is a superb movie , excellent and realistic portrayals of a middle class Jewish family in Brighton Beach , Brooklyn , of long ago . The nuances are perfect and I felt the casting of everyone was superior . I especially found the acting done by Judith Ivey just perfection---especially the speech she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home late one night . That scene was Oscar worthy . But , really , all the acting was fine . I recommend this movie . It is a fun , family film and delightful to see how a lovely middle class family lived in Brooklyn so long ago . See it and you will be glad you did . Has some very funny lines and the Eugene character is a real comedian--very funny . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly . Each of the three " " teenage girls " " offer their own believable , distinct , assertive and entertaining personalities . I particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between Keith and Lisa . If one looked beyond the superficial " " action " " that was taking place , Keith 's character treated Lisa 's " " deflowering " " with tenderness and consideration . The comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion . David Boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle . Dialogue was sharp , quick and flowed nicely . The director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled . Although the movie appears light on the surface , it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult , human emotions and desire . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this film at Amsterdam 's International Documentary Film Festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and Tobias Schneebaum , all of whom are lively and outspoken New Yorkers . The film 's title in Amsterdam was Keep the River on Your Right , making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent . Equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship Tobias Schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist . His reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving . I can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Viewed this GREAT Classic film of Greta Garbo and thought her performance was excellent . However , the German film version which had English captions was her greatest performance . Greta Garbo even mentioned to the press that the German film was her favorite where she had to make the change from Silent films to sound . Greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films . This story was very sad because Greta Garbo ( Anna Christie ) , " " Ninotchka " , " ' 39 , was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain .

" This is without doubt the best documentary ever produced giving an accurate and epic depiction of World War 2 from the invasion of Poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945.Honest and to the point , this documentary presents views from both sides of the conflict giving a very human face to the war . At the same time tactics and the importance of Battles are not overlooked , much work has been put into the giving a detailed picture of the war and in particularly the high , low and turning points in the allies fortunes . Being a British produced documentary this 26 part series focus is mainly on Britain , but Russia and America 's contribution are not skimmed over this is but one such advantage of a series of such length.Another worthy mention is the score , the music and the whole feel of the documentary is one of turmoil , struggle and perseverance . Like a film this series leaves the viewer in no doubt of the hardship faced by the allies and the Germans during the war , its build to a climax at the end of every episode , which serves to layer the coarse of the second world war . After watching all 26 the viewer is left with an extensive knowledge about the war and astonished at just how much we owe to the members of the previous generation . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I liked this movie . That 's pretty much all I can say about it . Lou Gossett did a good job , even though I 'm still very disappointed in him after all the Iron Eagle movies . And even if I was smiling on the inside when the first main teenager dies ( I won 't give it away ) it was done in a nice , fitting fashion . Pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job , so check it out !

" I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot . I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value . Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out . Frequently , you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction . I could not do that with this film.I would recommend this as one of the finer films of this genre . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers , ( there were a number of such film in the 1970 's ) . This one is about an accident at a Neuclear Reactor and of the attempts to cover it up . Jack Lemmon is the employee who realizes just how dangerous the plant is and Jane Fonda is the crusading television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best.The events portrayed in the film are , of course , terrifying and not in the least bit far-fetched , ( much of what happens here happened in real life at Three Mile Island ) , and although it now looks like something a period piece it , nevertheless , highlights just how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves . Expect a number of similar films about the effects of global warming any time soon , ( and not rubbish like " " The Day After Tomorrow " " either ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this series when it world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival . I liked the idea behind the film , where two men got together and told a director from each country to direct a movie about 911 . These directors never met before until the project was complete , and they saw how it looked all together . WARNING : SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! All the pieces were very powerful , and some were controversial . If you are an American , then you may not like this as some of the pieces may be found anti-american . However , i know a few Americans who enjoyed these series . The piece that i found the best was the one from India . It was about how a muslim family , living in the States , had 2 sons , and one of them was missing . The Americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked with the terrorist bombing . It captures the mom 's despair and humiliation of these accusations so well , that it brought tears to my eyes . In the end we see that her son had died while trying to save the many victims from the crash of the towers . This was a true story , and that was what made it so real . There were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces , and the African piece was one of the best . It was humourous yet just as powerful as the others . A must see for everyone , and hopefully America will unban this , and let it play in their country . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's a testament to Gosha 's incredible film-making prowess that he was able to complete both Hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece , Goyokin , in the same year , 1969 . And it 's a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public ( compared to media darlings like the great Akira Kurosawa ) , that both Hitokiri and Goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them.Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo : mad dog killer , loyal to the Tosha clan and their boss Takechi , played by another genre stalwart , Tatsuya Nakadai . The Tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the Emperor against the flailing Shogunate . The historical backdrop is fairly accurate - with Japan 's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the Tokugawa and the pressure by the West to end a 300 year social and political seclusion . It helps a lot to know a thing or two about Japanese history and what eventually led to the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the Tokugawa Shogunate , but it 's not essential by any means . The movie was made primarily for a Japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well.As one would expect from a Hideo Gosha film in his golden years ( the late 60 's ) the visual palette is breathtaking , the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty . Style however is never decorative for Gosha - it is always employed in the service of story . And speaking of story , Hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character Izo Okada . As most chambara protagonists , Izo finds himself in a moral double-bind , torn between giri ( obligation ) and ninjo ( natural impulse ) - although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is . In the first half of the movie Izo is trying for social self-advancement . Lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat 's daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer 's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century Japan . The turning point for Izo is when he realizes at what cost self-advancement comes , the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self . It is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the Tosha Clan to a " " nameless " " drifter without past or future , Torazo the Vagrant . Although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in Yojimbo 's mold , it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego , ambition and self-dillusion that allows Izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself . Hitokiri ends ( which I won 't reveal here ) in the best way any story can end : both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives Izo the last laugh , a last sardonic remark in the face of death . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years , and I can honestly say it hasn 't lost any of its kick . I can 't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful , moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty . It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two ' outsiders ' from school ; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other . As events from both the past and present unfold the tension gradually thickens , not dissimilar to Shane Meadows ' excellent revenge-chiller Dead Man 's Shoes . The acting , writing and direction are very bold for 1983 and still pack a wallop today in spite of the upper crust accents of the central characters . Yes , it might be set in public school but it 's worlds apart from anything put out by Merchant Ivory ; I got a state education and can still draw countless parables from the story . This is a film that you 'll remember for a long time if you see it - except you probably won 't , because Channel 4 ( or FilmFour ) have chosen to bury it . On their own official website they describe it as " " an inexplicably overlooked gem from the early days of Channel 4 " " - overlooked by who ? This was one of the very first Channel 4 films ( which would later go on to become FilmFour thanks to the success of films like Trainspotting ) , so somewhere someone must still have the master print . In these days where you can get extended collector 's issue DVDs of more or less anything it 's a bit moody that they can 't give a film this good the promotion it deserves . So , if one of the Channel 4 production flunkies is reading this , stop making programmes that showcase people humiliating themselves in the hope of securing a tabloid deal , chase up this film and sort out a nice special anniversary edition disc or something , please ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I thought this movie was perfect for little girls . It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most anytime they 'd like . Most little girls would like this story , even though there is the thought of death in it . Although no one dies , the king almost does , but little girls would not understand it , so it adds up to make a perfect story . All the events add up , creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough . This story is perfect for little girls , and since it is a barbie movie , the kids can have more fun with it , especially if they have barbies of their own . Anyone can have fun with it , though , because it is so cute and understandable . Overall , I think this movie is a good movie for everyone , especially little girls , and will give anyone a smile at least once during it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One measurement for the greatness of a movie is , ' if it came on t.v. right now , would you want to sit there and watch it again ? ' My answer for the Grand Canyon is as powerful a " " yes " " as it would be for nearly any movie I have ever seen . There are just so many powerful moments , such an intelligent and moving story , such incredible performances . It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that were so rampant in the early nineties . But it also dramatically affirms the capacity of individuals to love , think and care . In a slight way , the movie was of its time . It partly portrays society as a balloon about to burst . Because the country was in a recession , and so void of leadership , this was true of that time . But the movie is also timeless . I think it could honestly stand up against any movie that has ever been made , and it is the most overlooked film of all time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Oh man , why ? " " Six Degrees " " is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone . If focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions.When I first heard of this show , it didn 't caught my attention at all . It seemed too ordinary , actually . Then , i saw some episodes ... and loved it ! First of all , the characters . They are all well-written and different from each other . There 's a alcohol addicted , a woman whose fianc챕e cheats on her , a woman who just lost her husband , a driver who has a troubled brother and so on ... Unlike what we 're used to , most of the characters interact with each other in casualties , like in our daily routines . Great ! My favourite ones are Mae , Carlos and Whitney.Then , the cast . They are all great . Jay Hernandez , from " " Hostel " , " shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as Paxton . The other ones give great performances too , specially Campbell Scott , who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan , who plays Whitney.Well when i came to IMDb , after watching some episodes , i couldn 't believe that it got cancelled . Seriously , i can 't understand the low ratings.It 's too bad it didn 't have more than one season . It would really be a good show to follow ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There has been a political documentary , of recent vintage , called Why We Fight , which tries to examine the infamous Military Industrial Complex and its grip on this nation . It is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in Iraq . Yet , a far more famous series of films , with the same name , was made during World War Two , by Hollywood director Frank Capra . Although considered documentaries , and having won Oscars in that category , this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop , more in the vein of Leni Reifenstal 's Triumph Of The Will , scenes of which Capra recycles for his own purposes . That said , that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of World War Two documentaries ( such as the BBC 's lauded The World At War ) lacked , nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable . They are skillfully made , and after recently purchasing some used DVDs at a discount store , I found myself with the opportunity to select a free DVD with my purchase . I chose Goodtimes DVD 's four DVD collection of the series.Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable . While there are no extras on the DVDs , and the sound quality of the prints varies , these films provide insight into the minds of Americans two thirds of a century ago , when racism was overt ( as in many of the classic Warner Brothers pro-war cartoons of the era ) , and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts . The seven films , produced between 1942 and 1945 , are Prelude To War , The Nazis Strike , Divide And Conquer , The Battle Of Britain , The Battle Of Russia , The Battle Of China , and War Comes To America.Overall , the film series is well worth watching , not only for the obvious reasons , but for the subtle things it reveals , such as the use of the plural for terms like X millions when referring to dollars , rather than the modern singular , or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a Japanese sword piercing the center of Manchuria . Yet , it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars . The lesson of World War One ( avoid foreign entanglements ) was not applicable to World War Two , whose own lesson ( act early against dictatorships ) has not been applicable in the three major wars America has fought since : Korea , Vietnam , nor Iraq . The fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today 's information-clogged times . It may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today , but at least you 'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position , nor will you be the last . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Not all movies are Oscar worthy but let 's face it , sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression . This one left me smiling and happy and I couldn 't wait to hug my own son . Anyone who has had a pet ( no matter what type ) knows what it feels like to lose one . I believe most people would identify with Buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth . Bruce Willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother . The little boy who played Buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend Edgar played terrific backup roles . Liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy .

" The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house , good effects work and sound work , a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house . There are scenes that make you jump , and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past , I found interesting . There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets , curtains and the house itself . Jerry Goldsmith 's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you . What I wish could 've happened is for something a little more intense . Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much . Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago , and it still holds up . The Haunting could 've used a few more scenes of pure terror . The ending was for me , a little anticlimactic . Overall , I enjoyed it . The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump . I just wish it scared me more . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched this last night on TV ( HBO ) . I have to admit , that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other FN era movies . I loved the way Chip would be all calm one moment and then VIOLENT the very next moment . It was classic . Ahh yes . The dames , the villians , the cigars and thuggish cops ! It has it all . This movie delivered all the goods to me . I especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot , very common for this era of movie . Very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days . I rate this movie one of the best I have seen in the FN genre ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have never read a Jacqueline Susann novel , but I have also seen Valley of the Dolls , based on another of her books . On both occasions I thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age ( certainly contrary to the books ) . The reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion , design and behavior patterns . And in this aspect The Love Machine offers quite a lot . The set design fits the story perfectly . And all the characters fit in , too . They 're perfect in the way that they complete a well balanced general picture . They are superficial and do not develop , it is true , but in this movie I wouldn 't want it any different.David Hemmings reprises the role he played in Antonioni 's Blow Up . And it 's more than a rip-off . He 's a fashion photographer , looks visibly aged and seems to start going slightly to seed . Robert Ryan reprises the role he played in Max Oph체l 's Caught , he is Smith Ohlrig all over again , greedy , bored and boring , uninspired and uninspiring . It 's possible Ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly , on the other hand he might have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance . Whatever happened , it fits the picture . Dyan Cannon is great ( fantastic wardrobe ! ) , she dominates every scene she 's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie : the burning of a luxurious bed and the knocking down of the Hemmings character with a Academy Award statuette.The title , The Love Machine , is , of course , meant ironically . Robin Stone is a kind of a Barry Lyndon of the pop era ( incidentally , the movie IS slightly kubrickysh ) . That he chooses a TV station to work his way up to the top seems to be a mere coincidence . He sees love ( meaning sexual favors ) merely as a means for personal advancement . There are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie . Homosexuality is treated very casually , probably not the standard for mayor movies of the period . The open cynicism of the TV executives need not fear comparison with other good movies about the subject like A Face in the Crowd or Network or Truman Show . They are producing crap , they agree among themselves it 's crap and they know they will make a lot of dough with it.I did not regret spending the odd 108 minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if it picked up a cult following , provided it 's given the chance ( meaning a DVD release ) . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Charlie Wilson 's War , based on a true story , tells the tale of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent working to secure funding for covert support of the Mujaheddin in 1980s Afghanistan following the USSR invasion of the country . This conflict played a major role in the final years of the Cold War between the US and the USSR.In terms of film making , Charlie Wilson 's War is a definite winner . It well-written , well-acted , and well-shot . While most of the attention has gone to Tom Hanks for yet another fine performance , I was even more impressed with Philip Seymour Hoffman 's turn as CIA operative Gust Avrakotos . Scenes of Soviet attacks on under-armed villages and of the refugee camp effectively tug at the heart . The film also gives a good behind-the-scenes look at the wheeling and dealing that Congressman Wilson must go through to secure the desired funding.There are , however , two complaints I have about the film . The first is that there is a subplot involving an scandal investigation that is not well-developed and as such only serves as a minor distraction to the story line . The second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war . The film makes the Mujaheddin look like innocent victims , and while they did suffer large civilian casualties , the Mujaheddin were in fact rebels trying to topple the government of Afghanistan . This government , ignored entirely in the film , not surprisingly fought to suppress the rebellion , later calling on the Soviet Union for support in their effort . The film also ignores that the US was aiding the Mujaheddin prior to the Soviet deployment in Afghanistan . The film did hint at the unintended consequences of our covert actions -- consequences we are still feeling today -- but it seems as if screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative . ( Not having read the book , I do not know if George Crile made the same compromise . ) Those complaints notwithstanding , I did enjoy watching Charlie Wilson 's War and do recommend it . I would have preferred a film that more accurately depicted the complexities of the situation , as Stephen Gaghan did in Syriana , but the audiences connected better with cohesive narrative of Charlie Wilson 's War than with the ambiguities present in Syriana . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" People are being too hard on the film . Sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without attempting to " " review " " it.The whole thing comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his target still goes down . Then the fun begins as everyone about him also " " go down " . " Just think JFK and all the people associated in any way with his assassination , who 's lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you 'll appreciate what is implied in this film.I think it 's an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred . Though the EXACT story line my not have been followed ( hindsight here after reading Jim Maars " " Crossfire " " ) but it 's what is implied that is of interest.I 'd love to get a copy of it to view it again .

" I was amazingly impressed by this movie . It contained fundamental elements of depression , grief , loneliness , despair , hope , dreams and companionship . It wasn 't merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music . He finds a companion who comes with her own issues . Claire and Des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst . Des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star . Yet he has musical genius . He also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate , while things around him literally go to ruins . His focus is creating his Whale Music , in fact it becomes an obsession for him.Claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay . She finds hidden talents while being in Des company . She also finds a mutual friend that accepts her . She learns to trust him over a period of time.These two find love with one another . Not the mind blowing , sex infused kind of passion , but a love where friendship and understanding means more . For two people who have been hurt , they find trust together . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path : murder most foul , gathering of clues , gaggle of possible perps , sprinkling of red herrings , and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver . " " Forgotten " " abandons the well-trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts . The fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some , but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes , disturbs , and haunts with the question : What does an evil person look like ? Excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily ... forgotten . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" By 1955 , five years after this one was released James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films together , four of them Westerns . Their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a Universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic . Buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known - and that 's not counting Ray Teal or ' Anthony ' Curtis , later to become Tony . Perhaps ten years later the ' psychological ' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab into the mix with Cain and Abel , to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way , and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned .

" I loved this show . Such talent ; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled , after only just beginning . I looked forward to this show all week long . And so sorry for the people who were hoping to be The One . I would have loved to see who would have won . It just began , and in my opinion , it should not have been canceled . I hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts , and have the opportunity to reach their goals . I voted , and sat waiting for it to come on ; never knowing that it was canceled .

" If you came into the film with expectations , throw them away now , because no amount of hype will do this film justice.To categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal . It 's a spy thriller , has elements of noir , bits and pieces of action , science fiction , and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative , mind-bending plot twists , and gorgeous cinematography.A lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative , both in good and bad ways , of other movies . But as they say , every story cribs from Shakespeare , so once you can get past that , you 're in for a hell of a ride.You will need to suspend your disbelief at some points , and while the set never becomes unbelievable , there are portions ( read : the elevator ) which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals . Don 't misconstrue that to mean it 's on the same level as cheesy Sci-Fi channel movies , though , because this is on a much higher level.If you 're looking for action , you should turn away . This is pure psychology . But if you 're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience , by all means , DO IT NOW ! Watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Despite the previous reviewer 's screed , this is a well paced and interesting documentary with lots of clips from classic 1950s sci-fi films that influenced Spielberg , Lucas and others in their more recent efforts . I agree that Spielberg 's films aren 't even in the same league as the films discussed here , such as William Cameron Menzies ' brilliant INVADERS FROM MARS , to name just one of the many titles examined , but this is still a remarkably good overview of 1950s paranoid sci-fi . Yes , it turns into a commercial for the tepid remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS during the last fifteen minutes ; you can turn that off . The rest is surprisingly good , and it 's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them , even if they can 't begin to match the originals . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I had few problems with this film , and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated . True , it is over three hours long , but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly . I don 't think it is overrated at all , I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent . The film looks sumptuous , with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects , and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus . Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack , and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose . David Warner , a great actor , steals every scene he 's in . The story is very rich in detail , and is hot on character development , obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be , though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow . The last hour is extremely riveting , and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat , when the Titanic sank . I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving . The music score by James Horner was lovely , though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On . The 1996 miniseries was good , but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies . Overall , I give Titanic an 8.5 / 10 . Bethany Cox . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " Air Bud 2 : Golden Receiver " " is a very bad rehearse in making a sequel in the course of a single year . The first film was cute , cuddly and charming . The idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched , but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept . Even the human story had some explanation to it . Josh 's father was killed in a plane crash , so he is sad . And the audience becomes emotionally involved as well.Now for the poorly made sequel . It is terrible . This is the worst kind of bad sequel , the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones . The kind that changes the main plot piece in one way , this time , the K-9 plays football instead of basketball . No madder how much time is spent in mind over matter , benefit of a doubt , walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this , there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making.The sequel stars Kevin Zegers as Josh , who is in eight grade . He lives with his mother and little sister in a Seattle suburb . In the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident , which the audience can relate to , most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one . In this movie , the emotional plot is a bit more complicated . Josh 's mother is dating once again . He and Buddy , his dog who can play basketball , don 't like this at all . Why ? If I were in his shoes I would love to have an extra parent in my life , especially one this nice . The man 's name is Patrick Sullivan , and Josh 's mother , Jackie , met him became he is a local veterinarian for Buddy.The animal story is too simple . Josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team , the Timber Wolves . The team itself looks like something from America 's Funniest Home Videos , the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other . So when Bud shows up one day , he proves he can play as a receiver for them , and is no doubt the team 's best player.Buddy 's extremely cute in his football costume . Oh , he is enough to melt the heart . The dog is the best in this movie as well . Too bad there wasn 't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team.There is a very bad sub-plot about Russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals , of course they try to catch Buddy . But their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a " " Home Alone " " scenario to them . " " Air Bud 2 : Golden Receiver " " is much more goofy than the first too . The Russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapstick that , I have to admit made me laugh , at the stupidity of it all . There are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movie-to see a dog play football.The performances were also quite the embarrassment . I liked Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo 's presentations , but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a D + . Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic.There were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers , but that isn 't even worth mentioning . Will children enjoy this movie ? Perhaps , but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep . They will most certainly complain that the dog didn 't get enough screen time in , and loath over the fast changing script , and protest against the boring performances , and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al " " Air Bud , " " as I did.I suppose that they will think the dog is adorable . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" How often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen , with torrid affairs and passionate encounters ? Almost never , if what I see as normal life around me is anything to judge by . Romances , as previously stated , are hardly ever earthshaking affairs that leave you at the top of the world or batter and bruised.Romance , in its every day form , as lived out millions of times over around the world , is a slow , subtle , and quiet affair . Something that grows in you , ever so slowly , probably without you even noticing it slowly taking over your being . No one can tell me when I am in love . For if someone did , I would not believe him anyway , for no one but me would know . And even then , it is just a feeling , a certain knowledge that you are feeling this exalting emotion . That you want nothing but the best for someone , that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness . That you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them . I would not go so far as to say be willing to die for your loved one , for we are all human , and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us.Is the love between the main characters of the film , ever so subtle and understated , no less noble than that between Romeo and Juliet ? The unstated emotions , the unsaid feelings , convey far more than any repeated shouts of " " I love you " . " The restraint shown by the lead actor , displayed ever so poignantly in the scene where he watches his love interest through the cafe window , yet never did he move to make himself known to her , was simply heart-wrenching to watch . Would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden , knowing that her emotions and feelings could not possibly be reciprocated ? On another note , how will I deal with my own certain death ? While I can claim I have been seriously ill , I can not in all honesty say that I have ever come close to death . Will I be so calm , putting all my affairs in order , and leaving instructions for others to take up what I leave behind ? I suspect I will be calm , for I will have little choice in the matter . Can I be so selfless ? Again , the answer will have to be in the negative . I can empathize with the anguish , knowing that your life is forfeit , that fate has dealt you a fatal blow , and that future events , however little there are of them left , are no longer under your control.Life is nothing more than a series of small events , the culmination of which may seem great for some in retrospect .

" This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you . I found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability , this was represented in a great performance by both two Michael and Rory . Whether the story is based around a true story I feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human . On the whole this film reach into my soul and I too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity .

" Long trailer ? whoever said that has got to be joking. this has got to be one of the most in depth behind the scenes or making of documentary ever made. how can it be a trailer when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was conceptualized and then brought to the studios ? this documentary also spends lots and lots of time detailing how stunts were done and the new technologies created to achieve them. then it shows us how woo ping 's team came up with the fight scenes along with blocking tapes that pretty much put to shame the actual scenes with the actors. there is stuff mentioned about matrix reloaded , but there 's hardly anything really. if you are a real fan of the matrix , you have to see this documentary. the original documentary in the dvd is good , but incomplete compared to this one. for instance , it never explained why keanu wore a neck brace in the original documentary , but that is explained in Revisited. the Revisited dvd also shows carrie ann moss spraining her ankle during the lobby scene and being really distraught because she feels like she 's letting the crew down. and that 's just the tip of the iceberg. so ignore that " " just a long trailer " " review and go check it out for yourself. you won 't regret it. casual matrix fans need not apply ... , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I truly fell in love with the characters . They were very down to earth but each and every one of them had a hidden dark side . Sort of a mystery . David Graysmark , himself , was an enigma .

" Antonio Margheriti 's " " Danza Macabra " " aka . " " Castle Of Blood " " of 1964 is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of Italian Gothic Horror , and after Mario Bava 's " " La Maschera Del Demonio " " ( aka . " " Black Sunday " " ) of 1960 and Roger Corman 's " " Pit And The Pendulum " " of 1961 ( starring the great Vincent Price ) another must-see that earned the wonderful Barbara Steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female Horror icon in the history of motion pictures . But not only is the beautiful and brilliant Barbara Steele one of my favorite actresses of all-time , the screenplay to " " Danza Macabra " " was co-written by no one less than the cinematic genius Sergio Corbucci , who directed such ingenious Spaghetti Western milestones as " " Django " " ( 1966 ) and " " The Great Silence " " ( 1968 ) . Italy 's number 2 in the field ( right after Mario Bava ) , Director Antonio Margheriti is one of the all-time masters of Gothic Horror , and " " Castle of Blood " " is doubtlessly his greatest achievement . Hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting , yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece . When he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories , Edgar Allen Poe , in a gloomy London tavern , young journalist Alan Foster ( Georges Rivi챔re ) accepts a bet from a nobleman , that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all souls ' eve . As soon as Foster enters the eerie castle , mysterious things start to happen . After a little while , however , he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle , the stunningly beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood ( Barbara Steele ) . The mysterious events so far , however , have only been forebodings of the terrors the castle bears , however ... The eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood , the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by Riz Ortolani create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison . The wonderful Barbara Steele is fantastic as always , I simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress . No other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with Steele , and no actress ever will . Besides Steele , the movie 's cast contains another stunning beauty , Margarete Robsahm , and she also delivers a great performance . George Rivi챔re 's performance as Alan Foster is great , and the rest of the performances are also very good . " " Castle of Blood " " is outstanding in many departments : Barbara Steele Delivers one of her best performances , the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison , the atmosphere is incredibly eerie ... The film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere , Gothic beauty and the art of terror . In short : " " Castle of Blood " " is one of the most atmospheric and greatest Gothic Horror films ever made , and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre ! 10 / 10 , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I remember catching this film on a C4 screening a year ago and I was completely blown away by the whole thing . I thought the film managed to represent such a diversity of genres ; the supernatural , a love story , the intrigue of crime , and so many more.I was hooked on the whole thing after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters . It made me feel terrified at one second for Jimmy , and then had me laughing away at the gangsters in the next ... and all the time I had my fingers crossed that things would work out for Jimbo ! Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are superb , Bryan Brown is absolute quality and had me creasing up , along with David Field , who was funny as well as being an evil git.Since I saw this film I managed to order it on DVD and as a result , every person I show it to has been hooked in much the same way.This film is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy evening , and it 's one that you can really appreciate with your mates around . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler.The Aristocats is regarded as one of Walt Disney 's finest 2D animations with its charming script and cool characters , but it doesn 't quite have the magic that created Snow White or the Jungle Book.The slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment begin.The young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry , the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate with.Not the funniest Disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments , especially involving the Cats and the Dogs . The representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing.The story , after the boring beginning , is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be . There are hardly any lapses and no dull moments . The journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring , not to mention two very strange British swans.With Disney , you always get a strong meaningful message . With the Jungle Book it is where you belong , with Beauty and the Beast you explore the importance of inner beauty . However with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing . The film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough ; it seems very far fetched and irrelevant.My sister and I found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the Jungle Book cast.Despite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message , this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I love so much about this movie : the music , the cinematography , the acting , the story , and all the Mormon clich챕s . Just because they are clich챕s doesn 't mean they aren 't true ! This is not perfect , it is a movie after all . Though excommunications are held in well-lit rooms with nice big desks and chairs , it was totally appropriate to portray it as the dark , cold scene they did in this film . I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop , smoking a cigarette . I thought that was so cool . I mean , I believe that angels do watch over us . What is one supposed to do while waiting ? Smoking is a way some people pass the time while waiting . I loved the irony cause Mormons make such a deal about smoking . I saw this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake , and cried every time ! It blows me away . And I 've watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time .

" Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD . Yes , the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book , BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution . I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian , culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago ! Amazing the power of film on a child 's imagination , eh ? In high school I read the book and made a promise to myself to one day take that dream trip . Now , true this film was made in the " " old school " " style , meaning that Egyptians were portrayed by pink skinned and blue-eyed Brits . However , has anyone seen the current HBO series " " ROME " " ? Everything old is olde again . One can 't imagine why in this day and age we are still casting actors mincing around as Mayfair aristocrats in Roman drag . Not one actor on ROME could pass for an ancient Italian . That being said , the AMARNA period in Egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history . This film is immensely appealing ( to borrow a word from NEFER ) for its historical information ( BEER ! BRAIN SURGERY ! IRON ! ) and its gorgeous cinematography and score . I have a dreadful Taiwan DVD version which I watch over and over again praying that one day a true restored widescreen version will be available . For anyone else interested in this subject I highly recommend the historical novel " " A God Against The Gods " " by the author of Advise and Consent . If anyone of you film buffs out there knows how to contact Fox to urge them on , please let me know ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yeah , I guess this movie is kinda dull compared to some of Pam Grier 's other films . The plot is overly familiar , the dialog stilted , and some of the acting isn 't too good . But it 's worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film , where we see Ms Grier in a sexy blue wetsuit , with the zipper half unzipped . Yeah , it seems like a frivolous point when discussing an actress of Pam Grier 's talent , but she also happens to be an extremely gorgeous woman , and back in the day , she had a body that wouldn 't quit . It 's nice to see it being showcased in a tight wetsuit . Rent the DVD , and then tell me I 'm wrong . Can 't , can you ?

To the contrary , the master of ELEPHANT WALK , John Wiley ( Peter Finch ) , complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms--no matter how menacing--without a permit from the government ( and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability ) .

" I found this movie quite by accident , but am happy that I did . Kenneth Branagh 's performance came close to stealing this movie from Helena Bonham Carter , but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie . This movie brought to mind the excellent movies that Branagh made with Emma Thompson . Carter 's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as I have seen from a female lead in a long time . Portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off , but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life , she made it so believable . If this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women " " uglying " " themselves up for roles ( Charlize Theron , Halle Berry ) , I fell sure Carter would have had strong consideration for an Oscar . If you run across this movie on cable late at night as I did , trust me , it is worth the lost sleep . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Nurse Betty " " is the kind of movie you can 't describe on a poster or in a trailer or commericial . It 's the kind of movie that you walk in to expecting a more mature " " Dumb and Dumber " " what with temporarily insane waitress goes on a cross country adventure while avoiding crooks trying to kill her.The fact is , this film is a wonderful , heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams . The best part about " " Nurse Betty " " is it 's unpredictability . Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality , and along with the touching drama , and hilarious comedy , you can never tell what is going to happen next . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched this mini in the early eighties . Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor . In fact when he began Law and Order I was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role . Unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills . I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it . It is both factual and entertaining . Everyone should see it to know what really happened . I was so moved I purchased and read the book " " Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds " . " And saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight . If you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance Mr. Waterston can really provide an audience . Enjoy the movies ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" From the beginning of the show Carmen was there . She was one of the best characters . Why did they get rid of her ? ! The show not the same as before . Its way worse.The best episodes were with Carmen in them . You can 't replace someone from the beginning ! That is like South Park without Kyle or Child 's Play without Chucky ! It 's not right ! The niece who replaced her is just , ugh ! Awful . She doesn 't fit into the storyline at all . She was one of the main characters , and the niece can 't replace her . She was an awesome actress . Way better than the niece . Get her back , or you 'll lose a TON of viewers . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Sir " " has played Lear over 200 times , but tonight he can 't remember his opening lines.Sitting at the mirror , his eyes reflect the King 's madness . His dresser prompts him gently , mouthing the words.There is an air of desperation about both these men.The great actor knowing his powers are slipping away , his valet cum major domo cum conscience cum surrogate wife - aware of his boss 's decline into madness and knowing he is powerless to do more than ease his passing . " " The Dresser " " is really a love story between the two.Over the years they have become mutually dependent on one another to the extent that neither can conceive a future without the other . Set during the second world war , it concerns the fortunes of a frankly second - rate touring Shakespearean Company comprising an equal number of has - beens and wannabes led by " " Sir " , " a theatrical knight of what might kindly be called " " The Old School " . " Whatever part he is playing he grabs centre - stage and bellows out over the footlights , bullying his audience into applause.But , somewhere inside him , buried most of the time deep beneath the ham he regularly dishes out , there still remains an occasional glitter of his earlier greatness.It is to catch a glimpse of this that his audiences fervently hope for . Mr A.Finney very cleverly concentrates on the ham , often to the point of caricature , and , just when you are ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bluster he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realise that a great actor is playing a great actor . The same goes for Mr T.Courtenay.It 's easy to write off his portrayalof Norman as an exercise in stereotyping.Here we have a middle - aged effeminate rather than camp theatrical dresser sashaying his way through life , enjoying the company of " " The Girls " " and loving the wicked Insider gossip rife in " " The Theatre " . " There were - and I strongly suspect still are - many men just like Norman in The Profession.Infinitely kind and patient , knowing more about the plays than many of the actors , they run backstage with wisdom and affection.I believe the vast majority of them would hoot with approving laughter at Mr Courtenay 's portrait . I saw " " The Dresser " " on the London stage where , against the perceived wisdom , Mr Courtenay 's " " Norman " " was rather more subdued than in the movie . " " Sir " " was played by the great Mr Freddie Jones to huge acclaim from the audience.It was a memorable performance that overshadowed Mr Courtenay 's , reducing him rather to an " " also - ran " " as opposed to an actor on level - billing.The idea that " " Sir " " and " " Norman " " might be almost incomplete without each other went right out of the window . " " Norman " " was reduced to being his puppet , which I 'm not sure was what Ronald Harwood intended , but made for breathtaking theatre . Messrs Finney and Courtenay redress the balance in the movie , restoring equality to the relationship . Both men have come a long way since their early appearances in the British " " New Wave " " pictures when they became the darlings of the vaguely Leftish , " " middle - class and ashamed of it " " movement.When the British cinema virtually committed Hari - kiri in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door.With the renaissance of more substantial movies , they re - appeared , blinking in the unaccustomed bright light . " " The Dresser " " marked their return , still fizzing with energy and talent , shouting to the world at large " " We 're still here " . " It 's not a big movie but is assuredly a great one . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa . I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process . Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness . We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past . What 's happening in South Africa should guide us all . I found it credible , moving and at times upsetting . There were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative . Once again the BBC has been instrumental in taking a complex topic and turning out a top class movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures . It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people , living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world . Generally , a good movie . It entertained , provoked thought , and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise , right in our own back yard . Should be seen by all . Having lived in the U.S. all my life , I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn 't know they were citizens . This movie helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state . The obvious conclusion : If this is really for real , then what else is out there that we know nothing of ? , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you played " " Spider-Man " " on the PS version , then you 've seen it all . To truly experience it you should get the DC version . Simply put it 's a much graphically superior game ; the textures are sharp , levels are easy to navigate , and it has much better sound then it 's PS cousin . I bought this game back in late ' 00s and it still holds up even till this day . Well , Marvel : Ultimate Alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you 're a fan of ' ol Web Head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library . Swinging around the city as Spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game . If you have a Dreamcast , snag this up for cheap . The DC version is simply incredible . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official " " truth " " and caught so many " " news " " agencies with their pants down . This movie , in my view , deserves every price there is in journalism - it 's objective ( yes ! ) , courageous and a real " " scoop " . " It can do without comment , fake scenes or leading questions - everyone , including Chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words . The filmmakers " " only " " had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling.The Venezuelan elite teaches us " " How to depose of a President and sell it as a victory of democracy " . " It 's amazing that they lost in the end - so far . From what I know , the biggest TV station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked , they 're still broadcasting via cable and satellite . I highly doubt whether George W. or Barack Obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup . But then , they don 't have to worry.The fact that the " " Chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians " " scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so-called " " free " " ( established ) media really has become , or has always been , only more so . An important lesson to anyone interested in what " " really " " goes on in the world.The famous " " objectivity " " challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view , or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse " " us " " - it has been true with the effects of the Atomic bomb , the US secret history of spreading " " democracy " " around the world or the Iraq war that , according to Johns Hopkins , has killed 1,3 million Iraquis by now , not to mention the 60,000 Afghans ( in 2003 ) that are never mentioned . To be objective , Saddam Hussein was less damaging to his people than the US . And the US is ready & willing to be more damaging to the Iranians that he was.I 'm quite curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague , whether there will be any mention of " " our " " involvement in supporting and training Pol Pot 's guerrillas in the 80 's , when they had been largely defeated by the Vietnamese . Probably not.All the more reason to turn to the Independent media for balance , if not exposure of fraud . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Headlines warn us of the current campaign to demonize drug users , note the nostalgia for Mussolini in Italy and remind us of our wont to profile likely terrorists . " " Focus " " reminds us of the evils of rampant fear and distrust and the anti-Semitism disguised as pro-Americanism of the WWII era . What goes around ... Lawrence Newman ( William C. Macy ) becomes the unfortunate victim of hate crimes after he is mistaken for a Jew and these attacks increase when his bride , Gerty ( Laura Dern ) highlights the look . Newman rails against the false accusations when they cause him direct harm but he minds his own business . We see the rise in anti-Semitic attacks through his myopia , a condition not completely cured by eyeglasses.Macy 's typical everyman role is featured again and the long road to realization that we are all connected nearly costs him his life . What is it about the character Macy portrays to us ? We can 't choose to ignore the violence , hate , and bigotry because citizenship forces us to take sides . Newman 's dilemma is that he has no alternative but to side with the mistreated and goes through hell to see it . And our sadness is that most of us need to be beaten up to realize the dangers surrounding us.Let 's focus . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Babette 's Feast , for me , is about healing : mending the schism between spirit and body in orthodox Christianity . This puritanical community in remote Denmark is missing an adequate appreciation of all of God 's gifts in creation . They have taken the dualism of St. Paul to an extreme , and stress the life of the " " spirit , " " not the life of the " " flesh . " " Both elderly sisters , in their youth , were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village . They , and their parishioners , cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader , and the sisters ' father . The aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome , and the sisters don 't know what to do . Enter Babette , a French stranger , and someone to whom they can show kindness . They have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry , dusty theology . Babette will give everything she has , and in the process , will teach the sisters and their flock about grace , about sacrifice , about how sensual experience ( as in the bread and wine of the Eucharist ) can change lives , and about why true art moves us so deeply . When they can forgive each other , and themselves , they can focus on God 's love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present . As a minister , and an artist , I can 't recommend a movie more highly . True art and true grace ! ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell 's book tour . I thought it was amazing . Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie . Its campy and very funny . Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy . The plot is wacky , an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed . Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves / brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex-KGB turned cabbie . Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent . The movie has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humor . The movie is somewhat predictable , I knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer . However I didn 't go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script , I went to see it because it was a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie and I was not disappointed in the least . I highly recommend that you go see him on his book tour or wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month . Although before the movie he said the Sci-Fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it TV friendly . If you are a fan of Bruce , I highly recommend it . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film . It 's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance . It is a simple movie told very well . The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores ... If you haven 't seen this movie yet , you must check it out . The cast is all terrific . I wish they had never made sequel after sequel . The first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel . It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie .

" I saw the movie in the theater at its release , then watched the VHS tape over the years , and while strolling through Target saw this DVD bundled with " " Pushing Tin " " for the exorbitant sum of $ 5.50.There is something about this comedy that has really clicked with me - how Kelsey Grammar , " " with a tattoo on his thing " , " is an unorthodox commander who inherits a rusty diesel sub and a crew of screwballs and misfits . He 's up against the Navy 's best - a Los Angeles Class nuclear attack sub - and his old captain ( Wm Macy ) .Bruce Dern plays the bad guy , Rip Torn the admiral running the exercise - If you don 't laugh hysterically during the " " run silent " " segment with the cook , well , you have a different kind of humor from me.Towards the end the machinist says " " D.B.F. " " with no explanation - it is apparently some inside knowledge gotten from an old submariner consultant - thanks to Google I learned that with the advent of the nuclear subs the old salts would wear " " DBF " " pins - Diesel Boats Forever . A Navy friend said that many of the technical aspects aren 't correct but who cares - it is one of the funniest movies I 've seen.I don 't think it takes a clairvoyant to know who will win in this exercise ! , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Dog Bite Dog isn 't going to be for everyone , but I really enjoyed it . Full of slapping , stabbing and shooting ( but don 't worry 혯 the lead 's a terrible shot ) , it can best be described as a violent romp through Hong Kong and Cambodia . Edison Cheng plays Pang , a Cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister . Despite being filthy from his journey , he 's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant . If this sounds wildly implausible to you , you should probably avoid this film . It acted as my cue to suspend disbelief , and I had a lot more fun for it.Chasing Pang down is Wai ( Sam Lee ) , a young , edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke . Wai walks a fine line that has Internal Affairs investigating him , and his father , a legendary Good Cop , is in a coma following a drug deal that went south ( the implication is that Wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings ) .There are a car crashes , lots of killings , and a strange and awkward love story on offer here , all played out in almost comic-book style . I suspect the humour was deliberate ( nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd ) , though the over-the-top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members . There are at least three points where the film might have ended , and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing , or the deletion of one of the narrative threads ( the light-hearted stuff worked well , so I would have left out the interactions with the three fathers ) .I 'm inclined to give it a ( high ) pass , however , if only because of the ending 혯 I 've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment . This is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep ! It is in my opinion , the scariest movie of all time . Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever ! He was just so terrifying ! What makes Halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is , this was on a low budget and had a one note score , yet managed to scare the Hell out of people . 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in ' 78.It 's about a boy Michael Myers , he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution . Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back , since he describes Michael as " ... " pure evil . The blackest eyes , the Devil 's eyes " . " Michael is on a mission though , to kill his other sister , Laurie , played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis . She has to babysit on Halloween , while her friends are out partying and of course , we know the rules , they get it ! But Laurie may stand a chance since she 's the virgin . ; D Halloween pays many homages to Psycho , we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis , the daughter of Janet Leigh .

" A stunning film of high quality.Apparently based on true events which , as told , has the clear ring of truth about it , this movie is highly emotional and deeply moving.An abused and neglected child often becomes wayward in adulthood , as one of life 's failures , be it as a gangster , drug addict or burden on society.Antwone Fisher as a young adult in the navy , is troubled . He is on the brink of being a loser . He is counselled in therapy by a psychiatrist and it is that relationship which takes center stage in the play.In flash-backs and therapy the source and remedies to Antwones angst are revealed.Outstanding performances from the whole cast . The story is in effect a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment . All the actors give full blooded performances with conviction and realism.One message from the movie is the importance of raising children decently.The real Antwone deserves success . To have endured wickedness as a child but to rise above that , shows a magnificent character.And to all those out there who have endured such torment but to have survived and succeeded : you are all winners . 10 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I loved it , having been a fan of the original series , I have always wondered what the back story would be - it didn 't fail to delight me . I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz I didn 't recognise one person - this is refreshing , much like BSG . It has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - can 't wait for the series to start airing . Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job . The special effects , dialogue and acting were all spot on , and I felt emotionally tied up in the storyline . I know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment , but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most of the Sci-Fi stuff produced in the last decade . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best film of the year . It was a complete and utter joy to watch . I was riveted . The whole audience up at the Sunset Five was riveted , when the film ended no one moved , spoke , nothing . I think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has . Especially in so much as it sets an example of the quality of drama / work of this younger generation . There were moments in your film , many , like at least seven , where I was struck by such a great amount of beauty , emotional beauty , that I actually couldn 't breathe for a while . And for a catharsis junkie like me , that 's about the best censorial experience I could ask for . It is the result of powerful , masterful storytelling and direction . Like heavyweight stuff , like Burtolucci and those guys . Each element of the film fit tightly together . There were no missteps at all . The cast was amazing . I have been a huge fan of Emile 's and Ryan 's for a long time , and I thought they have never been better . I was / am / will be continuously stunned by this film .

" I got this one a few weeks ago and love it ! It 's modern , light but filled with true complexities of life . It questions and answers , just like other Eytan Fox movies . This is my favorite , along with Jossi & Jagger . This pictures a lot more , universally , than only the bubbles we may live in . You don 't need to be Jewish or homosexual to enjoy this - I 'm not , but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies . At first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further . Relationships we have to live with are superficial , meaningful , deep , fatal , you name it . You don 't know what 's coming , and you definitely don 't know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time . It is worth seeing several times .

" I thought this movie did a down right good job . It wasn 't as creative or original as the first , but who was expecting it to be . It was a whole lotta fun. the more i think about it the more i like it , and when it comes out on DVD I 'm going to pay the money for it very proudly , every last cent . Sharon Stone is great , she always is , even if her movie is horrible ( Catwoman ) , but this movie isn 't , this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime , and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs . Don 't wait for it to be a classic , watch it now and enjoy it . Don 't expect a masterpiece , or something thats gripping and soul touching , just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs.All in all , this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven 't seen it see it , because what the critics and box office say doesn 't always count , see it for yourself , you never know , you might just enjoy it .
