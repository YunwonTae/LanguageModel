" A pretty transparent attempt to wring cash out of the thriving British club scene , Sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments , but does very little else . A perfunctory thriller plot ( which is there merely to string the club sequences together ) , variable acting and a pretty ludicrous script , all stop Sorted from being the showcase that director Jovy obviously intended.However , although Jovy is sometimes over indulgent ( especially when using the often ill-fitting dance music ) he does show potential , and the lack of an anti drugs message is enormously refreshing . Overall however , the film is a wasted opportunity , and the prospects for a great clubbing movie remain out there somewhere . Watchable nevertheless . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Even though the book wasn 't strictly accurate to the real situation it described it still carried a sense of Japan . I find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to japan as it didn 't feel Japanese in the slightest . Almost everything about it was terrible . I will admit the actors were generally quite good but couldn 't stand a chance of saving it . Before the film started I was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a Friday night shortly after the movie had opened in Japan . 30 minutes in I was amazed they stayed . I stayed so I would have the right to criticize it . The whole movie was punctuated my groans and suppressed laughs of disbelief from my Japanese girlfriend . Everyone I saw walking out of that cinema had looks of confusion and disappointment on their faces . To the makers of this movie , you owe me two hours . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
I read all the reviews here AFTER watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else didn 't think that this appallingly unfunny montage WASN 'T the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era ! If this isn 't the least funny set of sketch * comedy * I 've ever seen it 'll do till it comes along . Half of the skits had already been done ( and infinitely better ) by acts such as Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel-ridden this waste of 75 minutes is . Seminal comedy ? Only in the world where seminal really DOES mean semen . Scatological humour ? Only in a world where scat IS actually feces . Precursor jokes ? Only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how NOT to do comedy . Tits and bums and the odd beaver . Nice ... if you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and haven 't found out that Playboy exists . Give it a break because it was the early 70s ? No way . There had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior . The only way I could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint . Retro ? Hardly . Sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles ( and it could actually have been funny ) but it just comes off as really quite sad . What kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes ? Sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end . I gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients ... or perhaps people suffering from lockjaw ... their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie attempted to make Stu Ungar 's life interesting by being creative . What they forgot is that his life was plenty entertaining enough on it 's own without having to make things up.A short list of the inaccuracies : 1 ) Stuey was not sent straight to Las Vegas for a Gin Tournament to pay off old debts , he spent a good deal of time in Florida first , and only went to Las Vegas when he ran out of Gin games on the east coast.2 ) Stuey never associated ( or played Gin ) with a casino executive ( like the one played by Pat Morita in the movie . ) 3 ) There was no magical turnaround in the buildup to the 1997 WSOP . In fact Stuey barely made it into the tournament as it was . He snorted Cocaine the week before even.Either tell the story right , or don 't tell it at all . 4 out of 10 stars for Michael Imperolli 's credible performance ( the only redeeming quality of this movie . ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I like movies about UFOs , which is why I recently decided to rewatch EYES BEHIND THE STARS after seeing it when I was a kid back in the late 1970s . And now I 'm compelled to write a review about it because I 'm afraid I 'll start forgetting everything about it FAST . You see , even though EBTS ain 't bad , it 's VERY dull and nondescript . The story is sorta interesting but flat . The actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing . The FX are terribly amateurish but I can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling , which , unfortunately , this one ain 't.Also , there 's very little violence and there 's no nudity whatsoever , which makes this 1970s Italian sci-fi opus a TRUE oddity , because if there 's one thing that distinguishes Italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade , it 's the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them . Oddly enough , because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements , EBTS stands out from the rest of the pact . I don 't know if this can be seen as a compliment though . Personally , I can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but I think EBTS NEEDED more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry . And the special effects aren 't that special.The story itself is actually interesting . It 's a combo of THE X-FILES and Antonioni 's BLOWUP : a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country . The aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model , subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth . The problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographer 's apartment ( this taking place just before she 's to be abducted herself ) . The man takes some of the negatives and leaves , with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives . The whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives . The majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue , in the spy vs spy variety . The UFO element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war McGuffin . But as dull as EYES BEHIND THE STARS is , it does resemble THE X-FILES a LOT ! I wonder if Chris Carter saw this movie . Anyway , the best thing in EBTS are the POV shots , which are creepy and effective . But the rest is almost completely forgettable , including the goofy looking aliens.Even though I 've been mostly negative about this film , I sorta cherish it nonetheless . I still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when I saw it as a kid . And I own the video . The film could have been so much more if it had been done properly . Oh well ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film should have been much better than it was . Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor but even he couldn 't rescue this tale of a young woman searching for the truth over her sister 's death . Spoiler warning : In effect the truth is that the older sister ( played by Diaz ) is just a spoilt , selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs . Not much of a twist and not that interesting either . The film is also overladen with far too many flashbacks and voice overs and lacks dramatic pacing . All in all this is definitely worth missing - not to be recommended . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is one of the most laughably bad films I 've ever seen . I cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious . Perhaps he was connected with making it . It doesn 't have anything going for it . There is no suspense , the acting is dire , the direction hopeless . The music score ( ? ) is three trite notes played ad nauseam . The plot ( ? ) must have taken all of five minutes to write . The dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come up with if asked to do a homework project . The only ( slightly ) redeeming feature is the actor playing the psycho himself , who grimaces , trembles and gurns magnificently and thus is amusing at times . The only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak bladder . Don 't waste your time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have always been a fan of Bottom , grabbing as many videos as I could find of the series here in the states . The chemistry between Rik and Ade is always genius , and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail . I thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness ... and was utterly disappointed by the end.The first 3 / 4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed ( sorry , Ade ! ) , but with some utterly brilliant moments . Unfortunately , these laugh-out-loud moments make you realize how less-than-brilliant the rest of the movie is . The slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring , with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous.The end of the movie ( the ' green ' scenes , for those of you who 've seen it ) was ... perhaps the worst ending I 've seen in the past decade . Honestly . It was one joke repeated about thirty times , followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense ( which didn 't bother me ) and wasn 't funny ( which did ) .To sum up , I was sorely disappointed by this movie . I shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it , to retain the fondest memories that I can ... but I have to warn you , if you 're about to overpay for your NTSC conversion tape from the local importer , don 't . There are far better things to spend your money on . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Poor Diane Arbus ( whoever she was ) . Not only was she ( according to this movie ) a spoiled-but-sweet-acting upper East Side brat , she was a bad wife , bad mother , awful business partner ; plus there is no evidence in this picture that she was any kind of an artist -- except in the bold statement in the prologue.Nicole Kidman , who incredibly is more attractive today than 25 years ago and actually looks younger , indeed gives an excellent performance ; but what can an actress do with a wife and mom who seeks out and falls for an incredibly weird werewolf-looking guy living in the apartment upstairs ? Set in the early 1970 's , Manhattan was a virtual magnet for freaks and weirdo 's of all sizes and shapes , most not looking like human hairballs ; so why is this affair worthy of a 122 minute movie ? Robert Downey Jr used to be one of my favorites , but I 'd say his well known and prolonged use of drugs has taken its toll . One might think he 'd be disinclined to be in a movie that treats drug use as casually as it does smoking cigarettes . FUR has already taken a beating at the box office , but in view of those who input a score of 10 for this misbegotten slice of trash , I 'd like to say , ' taint so , McGee . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was bad beyond belief . I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival . Before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before , which happened to be its " " world premiere . " " I don 't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point . We all understood by the end . Its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one . Dark Angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to Bettie Paige , in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old Bettie Paige movies . The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least . A scene would start going then someone would say " " wow you 're so great Bettie , why don 't we make another movie . " " this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a Bettie Paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as ( and even more boring than ) the normal part of the movie. by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another Bettie Paige movie remake came up. it was that ludicrous . I heard a lot of laughter in that theatre , but people were not laughing with the movie maker , they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure . This was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory . I know movies are expensive . I have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else I have ever seen . The movie looks like it was made for $ 12 . The cuts , the graininess , and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience . This movie makes " " Dude , Where 's My Car ? " " look like Citizen Kane . My friends and I left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured . The only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good . Apparently , the previous night , the night of the " " world premiere " " the director / writer / producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie . Bettie Paige 's movies were destroyed . They should destroy this movie too . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" So many bad reviewers , it made me wonder , what people are thinking while watching a simple flick made by a quite bad director ? ? ? Did you all expected a super-hit flawless movie ? ? No way , you already can see , Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-starrer movies ... All of his earlier works where multi-starrers , but no one was flawless . Take the first Jaani Dushman for instance , so many flaws , but still good fun . Anyways sticking to the movie , the movie Jaani Dushman is a Hindi fantasy film about a snake , who can take any form ( Armaan ( Munish ) Kohli ) which takes revenge for the suicide of its lover ( Manisha Koirala ) on the people who caused it . Its quite good , with a great star-cast . But i think it could have been much much better . For instance , take the script , can 't say its flawless . For example Take the ages : Do 40-48 yrs old still study in university ? ? There are many many more , i won 't list more , but there are dozen more . A solid 5.5 is good for this one . * * .75 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was the first sequel I 'd seen ( apart from Return of Jafar ) and I honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original . I was horribly disappointed.The storyline was , basically , the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around . Ariel and Eric have a daughter , Melody who isn 't satisfied with life on land . She wants to become a mermaid . However , Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her-and when Melody finds out she 's upset and angry . And she then decides to run away , and she becomes a mermaid . So she 's happy swimming around , and Ariel sets out to find her-as a mermaid.The story doesn 't sound too bad written down , but the clich챕s and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious . And adding the fact that Melody is , overall , extremely annoying , and the movie becomes almost unbearable.There 's also a whole load of other new characters-Tip and Dash being two of them . They aren 't too bad as characters in themselves-just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa ! The songs leave a lot to be desired too , they just don 't have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did . The animation obviously didn 't have a whole load of work put into it either-in parts it 's jumpy , and not much imagination is used for the characters movements.Another piece of advice-try to forget about Ariel 's original character while watching this movie . The beautiful , rebellious , curious teenager has ' all grown up ' into a bland , boring wife and mother , and her trademark red hair is all tied up . This is much better viewed if you 've never seen the original-you 'll have nothing to compare it to.However , all in all , it could have been worse-it 's not as bad as certain other sequels , such as Cinderella II . But it 's not in the same league as the original . But it for your collection if nothing else but if Disney go on like this they 'll lose all their older fans . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really wanted to like this film . The second film in the series had this silly , drive in movie feel to it that was fun ( of course , I was also drunk ) . I watched this film with the highest expectation of a similar experience of high cinematic hilarity , a-la- Mystery Science Theater 3000 . I WAS WRONG ! ! ! ! ! This movie is a god awful waste of film , and I LIKED THE SECOND ONE ! ! ! ! From the effeminate villain with the David Bowie fright wig , to the tacky , obnoxious female villains with laughs that could strip the paint off a garage door , this whole thing was just a painful mess .

" As with most of Ben Affleck 's movies , the comedy is dry and story is predictable . That is if you want to call this a story . Many points were left connected with no thought at all . I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better . I say that because , that would mean the torture would have lasted longer . As for any of Ben Affleck 's failures , this one is no exception and is survivable only by the other actors . Even then , the acting for the most part was contrived and was not believable . The trip down memory lane with actors I have not seen in years was not worth the price of admission . All thought it should be told , they too are quickly joining the ranks of the " " has-been " .

Rene Z. tries hard with an underwritten part , and so does Patricia Arquette . The detective whose name I can 't remember ( the one that 's not Chris Penn ) is a big sweaty over actor . See it if you 're not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you can 't follow it , and so confusing you can 't understand it .

" You believe in God or you don 't . You believe in Jesus or you don 't . You believe He is the Son of God or you don 't . The choice is up to you.Director Denys Arcand has really done everything he could to bring back Jesus to a mere historic figure , social worker , son of two humans , instead of the Son of God the Holy Spirit and Mary , Who opened Heaven again for us . Encouraging the Big Bang , a world come from evolution , instead of seeing the beauty of creation . The film depicts a theologian bringing some " " modern findings " " to the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion Play , who happily incorporates them in his play.The depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the Passion Play is performed in Montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the Passion Play instead of showing his love for God through celibacy . More often than not the director 's abhorrence of the Church is clearly visible.The director has tried to make a parallel between Jesus ' life and the Passion Play actor 's life . This is an admirable attempt , but depicting the Resurrection with the transplantation of the Passion Play actor 's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about Jesus.My opinion is not important , God 's opinion is , but I wouldn 't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before Jesus ' throne . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

What it reminds me most of are those Italian sword and sandal pictures of the nineteen-sixties ( not the good ones ) that spend an inordinate amount of time showing Greek or Roman despots in robes talking and plotting incessantly while you wait impatiently for the muscle man hero and his lover , usually the despots daughter , to do something.This film was in desperate need of some color and suspense .

I don 't have a problem with that . Unfortunately , science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons . But , one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap . I mean , couldn 't they even make it " " look " " good ? The other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting If I watched the movie now and knew what to expect , I might just enjoy it for the cheese-factor , but at the time , I was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being.Thankfully , the experience was over in only 85 minutes . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I bought this movie for $ 5 at a used CD store , and I kinda regret it . I 'll start by saying I 'm a huge fan of cheesy horror flicks . They provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment . This movie entertained for the first half hour , because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an MST3K style manner quite easily . Then it got boring.The acting is the scariest part of the movie . While great acting is not to be expected , this was laughably bad and , honestly , provided all of the entertainment that was to be had . This is the plus side to the movie . Where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing , lighting , and the editing.This movie provides way too many " " What the % $ @ # is going on ? " " moments . There are many moments , such as the mother having strange fits at dinner , and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie . Along the lines of dinner , someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served . During the meals and other inappropriate moments , the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside . Then cuts back in . And speaking of darkness outside , one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate , where apparently it isn 't nighttime unless it 's raining . And speaking of darkness , a big problem with the movie is that it 's so poorly lit you can 't see what 's going on half the time , which is more of a frustration than anything . In one of the climactic scenes , you can 't even tell what you 're supposed to be seeing that 's so shocking.And when it comes to climactic scenes , Unhinged contains one of the worst . I 've seen people say " " Wow , that surprised me , and that 's good . " " I can say that the big reveal did surprise me , because I didn 't see it coming . The reason I didn 't see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense . I won 't ruin it for you , but I will tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding to various parts of the movie to find anything that would have validated that at all , and all we found were more things saying that it wasn 't possible.All in all , this movie is actually better when you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it .

" " We 're on our own ! " , " says pilot Jack Lemon . He is so right . Except for George Kennedy . He 's in all these disaster movies.Watch another movie instead .

" B. Kennedy tried to make a sequel by exaggerating and amplifying혰a gargantuan leftist western ( not as leftist as the G.

Hundreds of peons , hundreds of Mexican _ compadres , hundreds of women , a desert , barren landscapes , a storm혰the largest scale.Everything in this clumsy sequel , likable only in a weird way , is phony.The movie itself is very ugly looking . Brynner , who made the best part in the first film , doesn 't look good at all in this one.Rey plays a priest ; he will be a political leader , Quintero , in the next sequel of the franchise . It is true that when you have that many characters you may not need a very interesting storyline ; sometimes . E.g. , Brynner meets McQueen ; then they pick other ' compadres ' ; or , B. Spencer meets Coburn ; etc .. It 's fun to see where and how they 'll meet the rest of the crew , etc .. But you need at least these several characters .

Another member of the commando is a womanizer , who will take good care of the wives left without husbands . The sexual humor is especially displeasing and distasteful in this film . It strives to seem smart and spicy ; it is simply boorish and dumb and gross.The choosing of the members of the small army was one of the greatest joys in the McQueen film . Unfortunately , in the first sequel there is the most unmemorable of the three crews assembled under the Magnificent Seven 's name.Robert Fuller makes a lousy " " Vin " " ; Oates is the smiley womanizer.In this mock혰gargantuan attempt , a Mexican revolutionary leader has a gargantuan plan혰he kidnaps 300 peons and uses them to build a village and a church in the memory of his lost sons . ( Useless to say that this insane Mexican revolutionist doesn 't equal Wallach 's part in the first film . ) B. Kennedy bets exclusively on camp and over혰the혰top stuff : ugly landscapes , a thunderstorm , gargantuan lightning , a desert . A huge battle between the emancipated peons and the revolutionary vaqueros . Of course Return of the Seven ( 1966 ) completely abandoned the good sense of the McQueen film.What is particularly shocking is that this sequel came quite quickly after the original film혰yet , everything changed meantime in the way of making westerns.Both the sequels look weird . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Easy mistake to make . Cue a startlingly incompetent team of Army Special Forces to tackle the prehistoric beasts . They are led by Colonel Rance , played by Scott Valentine ; a man who seems to have perfected ' Smell the fart ' acting , as advocated by Joey in Friends.There 's plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting , but unfortunately Rance 's team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant , lumbering monsters . Also , the lights always seem to flicker and go out whenever a Velociraptor attacks ( preumably so we can 't see how bad the creature effects are ) .Having said all that , we all had a great deal of fun betting on who was going to get their head bitten off next.As a Jusassic Park / Aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur 's crotch , but as ludicrous , tongue-in-cheek entertainment it 's a roaring success . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Almost a B movie with second rate acting and directing . I wasn 't even disappointed , I just don 't know what they were trying to do . This remake doesn 't try to play with the original material , it 's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era.It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph.This is a complete waste of your time .

Right then and there I had problems with the series - come on , I say to myself , is this the same noble Michael Stivic that countered Archie Bunker 's right winged philosophies ? The series went on , but it just didn 't have any pizazz . Whatever momentum Sally Struthers gained from All the Family was long gone . Maybe , if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of All In The Family , it might have worked out .

" Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey . With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming , the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken . Personally I do not agree with singers becoming actors ( hence , Ozcan Deniz - the lead actor ) but I guess the figures speak for themselves.In relation to the movie , it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline . Years in the making , this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series . Not only that , the cultural mistakes were unacceptable , with an idiotic scene involving the family members dancing ( Greek style ) and breaking plates , which does not exists anywhere within the Turkish culture.Some argue the movie should be taken as a stand alone movie not as a continuation of the TV series but this theory has one major fall , the way the movie was marketed was that it will be picking up where the series left off and will conclude the series once and for all . So with that note in mind , me and everyone I know , would have asked for a refund and accepted to stand outside the theatre to warn other victims . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Here is a fantastic concept for a film - a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputy 's single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over . Leave it to Albert Pyun to screw that up ! Don 't get within 100 feet of this flick ! Holy crap , what a bomb ... it might be Pyun 's worst yet ! The crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here - an entire of an outbreak told from the POV of a dashcam . When I heard that a while back , I imagined the car smashing into stuff , people getting run over , and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos . That would be cool right ? Instead , we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area , occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there . The last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera , just noises are heard offscreen . Stay away ! ! ! On a somewhat relieving note , I think I am officially calling an end to my Pyun watching ... only took me 20 crappy movies to realize I have better things to do . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I realize most people don 't know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is pitched at that much larger audience . But then why bother to call it " " Solomon Kane " " in the first place when the name has no marketable value ? The characters certainly has NOTHING whatsoever to do with the R.E. Howard character . Except he has a big hat . That 's where the resemblance ends.It 's always a bad sign when any superhero / fantasy / sci-fi movie lingers over an origin story , but when you invent one whole cloth like this for a character who didn 't have one at all , you 've already missed the point completely . Kane is no longer even the fanatical Christian warrior of the stories , but rather a formerly bad guy who is trying to save his soul ( this part is in the opening scene ) .With the most basic character elements changed or simply ignored , the use of the name Solomon Kane is simply perplexing . Is it just so they can say " " From the creator of Conan " " and hope to plug into a budding franchise if the new " " Conan " " movie gets off the ground ? Ignoring the complete departure from the stories , the movie is competent if utterly generic for the first half but then devolves into sheer stupidity in the climactic scene which involves multiple super baddies ( think three " " boss levels " " at the same time ) , none of whom is the least bit interesting or menacing.If I wasn 't a Kane fan who was disappointed that they completely ignored the source material , I 'd probably give the film a 3 or 4 instead of a 1 . Even for the ( majority of ) viewers who will come into this knowing nothing about Kane , it 's pretty thin gruel . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" So I give it one star for true quality , but I 'd give it an eight and a half for sheer enjoyability . An incredibly strange hybrid of sex comedy and vigilante thriller , " " Young Warriors " " is just the sort of bad movie you usually hope to find when poking around the video fringe , yet so rarely do . It starts off with about half an hour of wacky hi-jinx , sex jokes , and juvenile shenanigans ( including an olive in the martini joke that has to be seen not to be believed ) . Then the main character 's younger sister gets gang raped by a bunch of swarthy bikers ( an objectionable scene that keeps me from giving this a 10 for entertainment value - rape is not entertainment ! ) , and the main character gets the rest of his sex crazed frat brothers to help him in a quest to clean up the city , find the responsible bikers , and kill anybody slightly criminal they run into along the way.It 's hilarious , non-stop fun , apart from the very unpleasant rape scene , and is essential viewing to any serious bad movie fan . Trust me - I 've put my time in on these things , and this is one of the best . Highlights include a wonderful visit to the library , a great flickering slo-mo shootout in a sleazy bar ( with a shot of a guy blowing his own foot off that 's pretty impressive ) , a couple of decent slumming actors ( Richard Roundtree , Ernest Borgnine ) , a couple of semi-famous recognizable faces ( Lynda Day George , scream queen Linnea Quigley ) , and a couple of relatives of famous people ( Chuck Norris ' brother Mike , Van Patten clan member James ) . It even has one of those great " " What have we become ? " " type morality lesson endings , although the turning point comes when the vigilante fratboys gun down a couple of kids robbing a store with a toy gun . I 've always wondered why that was the catalyst that got the hero thinking ; after all , whether they were kids and not hardened criminals , and whether they had a real gun or not , they were in fact still robbing a store , so as far as I can tell , it was just another job well done for our vigilante frat boys , right ? Wonderful stuff . Highly recommended , just don 't blame me when you enjoy it despite yourself . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The saving grace is that 's it is short , there 's a scene stealing cat ( love her fall out of the kitty bed ) and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical in his brief bit .

" I like bad movies . I like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration . Then there are abhorrent movies like this . Redline is not just a bad movie , but a telling sign that maybe the American movie industry should please , for the sake of the viewer , at least proofread scripts before funding a movie.If a stereotype took a crap , this movie would spawn from that . The storyline is unbearable , and the acting all around is laughable . Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have , perhaps , the worst screen chemistry I 've seen in a good while , and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants ( about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for ) . Furthermore , how Angus Macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that I can 't even think of an analogy . I am a loyal fan of his , but this has made me question him.To sum it up . Several people want revenge for different reasons ( and if you care enough to know what they are , you 're a bigger person than me ) , so much so that it turns to violence ( I guess ) . The movie is like Ouroboros , the snake that swallows its own tail , in that it 's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears . This movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half , and an indecipherable action movie for the rest , it should be avoided at any and all costs.I wish I could find one positive aspect to this movie , and I think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll.P.S. Nadia Bjorlin , if that was YOU singing those two songs in this movie , then you are a hack , and I hope old age ravages you.P.S.S. If you DO rent this movie looking for a laughable experience , listen for the lyrics to Nadia Bjorlin 's awesome songs . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm not going to lie and say I don 't watch the show--I do . BUT it has a lot , and a lot of flaws . 1 ) The Boarding School is perfect . The drama is at a minimum . Everyone is so nice to each other , you know . Lets give that a reality check . Its IMPOSSIBLE that ANY school is perfect like PCA . Free laptops for everyone . Big dorm rooms . Mini fridges . If there was a school like that in real life , almost nobody there would be a virgin for one . Two , everyone there is so rich , and its weird how nobody has anything stolen yet . 2 ) Characters really unrealistic . First things first , who in they 're right minds talk like they do . They talk like a perfect teenager would . Secondly , Logan Reese ( Matthew Underwood ) is an extremely rich boy " " hot " " teenage boy . My question is , why isn 't almost ever girl in that school all over him ? He 's rich and " " hot " " now a days all those girls would be after him , even if he was a jerk . Also , Chase is the most stupidest person ever . He is this shy teenager who claims to not be in love with Zoey , and over-reacts to everything that involves Zoey .

" Redline is a knockoff of Fast & Furious , without any of the redeeming qualities . It doesn 't need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises , but it needs SOMETHING !

Except that this is worse , because you don 't get your money 's worth . Mind-numbingly boring , impossible race sequences , and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars , which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie . Sure , she 's hot , but who 's that desperate for an on screen female ?

" Basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war . But there were a couple things that struck me . First was the use of mouthed epithets . In two cases the Scott character mouths one , once at the beginning when he drops his bomb off target during the bomb-off ( " " dammit " " ) and once when he is trying to sway a bombardier into being a pilot ( " " s * % t " " ) . I could be wrong about the second instance but I replayed it several times and that 's what it looks like to me . The third case is when the Anne Shirley character wishes the O 'Brien character goodbye and good luck ( " " Give ' em hell " " ) over the roar of the engines . She must have thought that was too unladylike because she clearly says " " heck " . " I also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing , specifically bombing civilians . The avuncular superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the precision of the bombsight used . Given what we know about the LeMay 's later strategy of firebombing Japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays with not a little irony . I remember McNamara 's quoting of LeMay in " " The Fog of War " , " something to the effect that if the US did not win the conflict he would be tried as a war criminal . The ending is way overwrought , in keeping with the movie . It reminded me a bit of the end of White Heat ( I 'm not comparing the films , just the ending ! ) . Maybe it 's just ' cause he gets blowed up . Blowed up real good ! ! ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I caught this on IFC last week and I thought it was typical of the indie short subject film : heavy on style , little on substance and originality . Does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive ( and blond to boot ) boy with 70s shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes ? Plus , this film wallows in late 1970s chic , which works for some ( Sofia Coppola 's " " The Virgin Suicides " " comes to mind ) but not for this director.Another reviewer compared this to Harmony Korine 's work and I agree . Yet I don 't view this as a positive thing ( what has HE done lately , anyway ? ) . " " Bobbycrush " " is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved .

" I saw this not too long ago , and I must say : This movie is terrible . I watch crappy movies for fun . Scarecreow is not fun . Scarecrow is stupid . You have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims ( actually worse than the one contained in this sentence ) . He has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings . " " Everyone picks on me . The only girl that thinks I 'm not trailer-trash likes one of the guys that pick on me . I want to kill everybody . Wah . " " OK , I 'm exaggerating . But the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies.Adding to what I just said , the kid 's mom is promiscuous , he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on , mom 's boyfriend tells him to leave , kid refuses , insisting that he isn 't going to leave his own house . Boyfriend chases kid into corn field . He kills kid right in front of mom , mom screams in terror , boyfriend is like , " " OMG ! I didn 't mean to ! " " Then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it . Kid was killed under a scarecrow , though . So , like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow , he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance . His victims " " haven 't been stalked like this before ... " " ( Scarecrow 's official tag line ) To make matters worse , this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days . That 's right , 8 days . I was going to give this movie a 2 , because in spite of itself , it has one or two redeeming moments . ( They 're spoilers , so I won 't spoil it for you , if you actually want to see this crap . ) I could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting , the horrible special effects , the abysmal script , and the bad camera work , but I simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level.This movie isn 't nearly as good as I 'm making it out to be . If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie , or if you enjoy watching bad movies , like I do , then watch this at your own risk . Everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series . Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing , manipulative father , it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice . In my opinion , it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time . The TV series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation.This movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word . Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film . This movie has a very dreary , depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions . Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub ( and not in a comical way ) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie . The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour.The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the TV series . In the TV series , Harold always went after respectable girls , not strippers.Albert 's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold 's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series . In the movie , Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises.Most movie spin-offs of British sitcoms tend to be quite dull , with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES films ( which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself ! ) . But , STEPTOE AND SON has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile , even below GEORGE AND MILDRED.My advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off , STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead . It has a much lighter tone , is more faithful to the TV series , and is actually very funny . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Why did they not follow the book ... I am really sad and disappointed . I was so looking forward to seeing this movie , however , if you have read the book ( maybe recently ) it might be very difficult to remain objective . My wife had not read the book , and she loved the movie.Reasons for the disappointment are : 1 ) Cern 's involvement ... gone with the wind , such a shame , there is a very small part at the start , where the antimatter is created , but even that does not stick to the facts ( why not , the fact that Vittoria 's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand , which is how Langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the Movie _ 2 ) Story-line between the ( deceased ) pope and Camerlegno completely gone ... this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3 ) Story-line between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra completely non-existentAll-in-all , too flaky storyline , and cannot understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name against it . Maybe I should revisit this film in 10 years time , when I cannot remember the excellent book anymore ( fat chance on forgetting the book I am afraid ) Really sorry for the negative review , which was spoilt by expectations , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" These are excerpts from a nine-page " " Memo to Mr. Cohn from Mr. Welles " , " written after Orson had seen studio mogul Harry Cohn 's edited version of the picture ( he took an hour out ) : " ... " The preview title music was written by a first rate composer , George Antheil . Although not written for our picture at all , this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable ... The only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer ( Heinz Roemheld ) is the rather weary one of using a popular song--the " " theme " " --in as many arrangements as possible . Throughout we have musical references to " " Please Don 't Kiss Me " " for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material . The tune is pleasing , it may do very well on the Hit Parade--but Lady from Shanghai is not a musical comedy ... Mr. Roemheld is an ardent devotee of an old-fashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as " " Disney " . " In other words , if somebody falls down , he makes a " " falling down " " sound in the orchestra , etc . , etc ... If the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative , I couldn 't be unhappier about the results ... Just before I left to go abroad , I asked Vi ( Viola Lawrence , the editor ) to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi-cab and also quite a bit of dialogue . I am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut ... saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence ( this was not done , accounting for the main weaknesses of the film 's opening reel ) ... There is nothing in the fact of Rita 's diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo ... What does matter is Rita 's beauty ... the evil overtones suggested by Grigsby 's character , and Michael 's bewilderment . Any or all of these items might have inspired the music . Instead , the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a Silly Symphony : a pratfall by Pluto the Pup , or a wild jump into space by Donald Duck ... There is no sound atmosphere on the boat . A little wind and water is sorely missed . There 's no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen ... At the start of the picnic sequence ... in the temporary score , we used a very curious , sexy Latin-American strain ... This has been replaced with a corny " " dramatic " " sequel--bad stock stuff ... This sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved Lady from Shanghai from being just another whodunit ... There is a big musical outburst after Grigsby 's line , " " I want you to kill him . " " This is absurd ... The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio ... was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point . As it stands now , it 's on about the same level as the rest of the scoring . Nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we 're kidding ... The aquarium scene needs more echo . " " Please Don 't Kiss Me " " is in again ! ... A bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of Michael 's run down the pier . From the gunshot through to the phone call , a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort . For some reason , this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo . As a result , the whole sequence seems dull ... The audience should feel at this point , along with Michael , that maybe they are going crazy . The new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they 're going to sleep ... The gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music ... The closing music again makes reference to " " Please Don 't Kiss Me " ...

There was a side story about the main character and his partner . This relationship could have been explored further . More important , though , would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the " " boy " . " Her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into . She obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way . If my husband wasn 't such a huge Williams fan , we would have left 20 minutes into it . Too bad I can 't get my $ 20 or 2 hours back . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Let 's see how many ways you can insult my gender : 1 . Of course girl # 1 is a horrible skank who cheats on her boyfriend and sounds / looks like a heroin addict.2.

" " " Red Sonja " " is flawed , weak and lacking . Even the camp-ness isn 't good.There are only two good things about " " Red Sonja " " ; The costumes ( even though the Red Sonja costume is ridiculous . It 's ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men , because she was raped , still choose to wear so few little clothes , even when it rains . ) and the music by Ennio Morricone . Still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable.The story is extremely simple and they didn 't even bother to make it interesting . The story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor , both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways . The movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely.Brigitte Nielsen is an horrible leading lady . I don 't know who 's accent is worse ; Hers or Arnie 's and on top of that ; She can 't act . There is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable . Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag . Ronald Lacey was somewhat good in his role , but my God he looked horrible , he changed so much since his ( only well known ) role in " " Raiders of the Lost Ark " . " Maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991 ? And by the way , what was with all those " " Raiders of the Lost Ark " " actors in this movie ? Next to Ronald Lacey , Pat Roach , Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow appeared in a role , it seemed like some kind of " " Raiders of the Lost Ark " " reunion.The only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the ( sword ) fights even though some of them are needless and weak.Only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy-genre.4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm not a movie snob . I 've liked lots of movies that critics hate , and I 've hated movies that critics love . However , I have to agree with critics here-- " " Galaxina " " is just substandard . Clearly intended to be a comedy , it only has a few scattered laughs . " " Galaxina " " has poor photography ; it has poor special effects ; it has some pretty poor acting ; and the production values ... well , the sets might as well have been made of cardboard . " " Galaxina " " tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called " " The Blue Star " . " After a long voyage ( and some very unconvincing space battles ) , the crew arrives at its destination , a sort of wild west alien world . There 's a painfully unfunny cantina scene ( clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous " " Star Wars " " scene ) , a chase involving space bikers , and a final getaway.The cast tries , but can 't breathe life into this turkey . Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber have done better work in other movies . James David Hinton is pretty good as a member of the spaceship 's crew . The late Dorothy Stratten stars as the robot of title , and while she looks great , her role doesn 't give her much of a chance to act.You might catch this film to see Dorothy Stratten . However , if you 're looking for a good movie , you 'll probably want to skip this one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie is nothing but a religious tract promoting classic Hinduism and New Age Occultism dressed up with Western images to be swallowed by those who are ignorant of foundational religious comparisons . Basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation . ( Some of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the 1600 's ) obviously reincarnated . God is an impersonal force . Animal life and plant life are all the same . ( This is Pantheism ) . Redfield has tried to mix Eastern Mysticism with Western Christianty . His attempt at syncretism may fool or confuse those who are not seekers of truth but this movie is a feeble excuse for any ultimate reality .

" I have a 5 minute rule ( sometimes I 'll leave leway for 10 ) . If a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it 's probably not going to ever get better . I have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory . Dan in Real Life is definitely no exception . I was watching this turkey and thought ; wow , this is not funny , not touching , not sad , and I don 't like any of the characters at all.The story of an advice columnist / widower raising three young daughters , who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend . I suppose the tagline would be " " advice columnist who could USE advice " " ? I don 't know . Dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice . I guess THAT 'S the irony ? I don 't know . He goes to see his parents , brothers , sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat , which seems very sweet , and potential fodder for good comedy , story lines ... none which ever emerge . The central story is basically how he loves this woman , but can 't have her .

" I saw this film at a pre-release screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills . As I recall , the film 's producers and director were in attendance , presumably to gage our reaction.Many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience , which would have been fine if it had been a comedy , but it was supposed to be a horror film.If the audience wasn 't scared , it seems the filmmakers were . They delayed release for over a year . Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if they 'd re-cut it ; as far as I can tell , they hadn 't . It was the same lousy movie , just a year older.It almost qualifies as " " so bad , it 's good , " " but it 's slow-paced and boring . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I 'm surprised I even found this movie on the $ 1 DVD rack where it was aptly placed . I thought maybe it was going to be good and that I might discover some amazing independent film - I was wrong .

" When I saw the previews for this movie , I didn 't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie . But wow , this movie was absolutely awful . And that 's being generous.First of all , the casting for the movie was terrible . You feel no sympathy ( or for that matter any morbid feeling ) for the characters . The acting was so terrible that I was just simply waiting and hoping for the God-awful thing to end.Secondly , there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever . Can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming " " PANCAKES ! ! ! " " at the top of his lungs while going into Jackie Chan moves I 've never seen before , and even further biting the guy who has the virus ? Why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy , and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him ? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I literally said out loud , " " Where the hell did that come from ? " " I just simply couldn 't believe what I had seen . I really thought I had seen some bad movies , but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all . This movie made me want to puke and then puke again .

" Generally I like horror movies , but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand . We sat down to watch it , ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much . The concept isn 't that bad , but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky I don 't know . The worst thing about the movie is the actors . The camera work was poor , the special effects are actually not bad if I am being generous , but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm . They were wooden beyond measure , especially a foppish young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent . He looked more like a public school boy in fact . There was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later his nappy sized underpants were hysterical , but then I remembered it wasn 't supposed to be a comedy . I 'm desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts , but there simply isn 't . Let 's hope ten was the lucky number and they don 't do another one , I 'm not sure my ribs could take it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In 1972 , after his wife left to go her own way , Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson . Miss Thompson , a good-humored , long haired , lovely , statuesque beauty queen , is charted to fill a void in Elvis ' life . When Elvis ' divorce became final , Linda was already in place as the legendary performer 's live-in girlfriend and travel companion until 1976.This is a gaudy look at their love affair and companionship . Linda whole-heartedly tending to her lover 's needs and desires . And even putting up with his swallowing medications by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with valium . At times this movie is harsh and dark of heart ; a very unattractive look at the ' King ' and his queen.Don Johnson is absolutely awful as Elvis . Over acting to the hilt is not attractive . Stephanie Zimbalist lacks the classiness of Linda , but does the job pretty well . Supporting cast includes : John Crawford , Ruta Lee , and Rick Lenz . Watching this twice is more than enough for me , but don 't let this review stop you from checking it out .

" This inept adaptation of arguably one of Martin Amis 's weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as Requiem For A Dream or anything penned by Irvine Walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap-stick cartoon or a hyper-realistic hallucination.Boringly directed by William Marsh in over-saturated hues , a group of public school drop-outs converge in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three American friends for a weekend of decadent drug-taking . And that 's it .

" Man , is this lousy . It doesn 't deserve much in the way of comment so , keeping it brief , Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls for Latin Lover Antonio Banderas in a wine store , he of the ponytail and jail-house tats . When she cuts loose , she really cuts loose . Other than this torrid affair she 's having ( and we must admit the affair has its speed bumps ) she 's a pretty cold fish . Her broke , ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out . She 's also adept at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor ( Dennis Miller ) at bay . And there 's prisoner Harry Dean Stanton who 's trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so he won 't have his privates nailed to the wall for the serial murders he 's committed.All these people , and perhaps more , are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her . Somebody sends her dead flowers . Somebody does unspeakable things to her pet cat . ( The next time I see a household pet turn up in a parcel or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot , I 'm going to puke . ) So who 's doing it ? Guess . No power on earth could force me to reveal the ending , but maybe a hint will help : childhood abuse.The abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself , far more interesting than the movie . What does " " childhood abuse " " mean ? Do we mean sexual abuse ? Physical ? Both ? How about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon , hard enough to break it ? That 's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids , just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood . Sexual abuse ? That never happened to any of us , as far as I know , although I 'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation . In the Samoan village I studied for two years , there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl . The girl 's family beat hell out of him . The boy 's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village , an exile that lasted two years . By the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone , including the child . ( By the way , the little girl we see here is under five so it 's unlikely that she 'd remember Dad 's night-time visits in any case since long-term memory isn 't really established until about that time . ) DeMornay 's experience leading to her mental disorder can be called " " the social construction of trauma . " " It 's not there unless we put it there . Enough of the psychiatric lecture . That will be fifteen cents.You want trauma ? I 'll give you trauma . The film absolutely forces us to identify with Rebecca DeMornay 's character , right from the beginning . Then , when she has her first tryst with Antonio Banderas , and Pio Donnagio 's score is pounding the eroticism into our heads , the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the bare-torsoed Antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest . Now THAT 'S traumatic . It makes any male viewer feel as if he 's on the floor of the laundry room at the California Men 's Colony in San Luis Obispo . Don 't get me wrong . I don 't dislike Antonio Banderas . It 's just that I 'm not in love with him . There aren 't enough nude shots of Rebecca DeMornay 's elfin body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety.Here 's an engaging way of surviving this movie . Instead of just sitting there puling , try picking out the scenes that were filmed in Toronto and separating them from the ones shot in Budapest . It 's a challenge , really , and may , for all we know , preserve your sanity . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It hurt to watch this movie , it really did ... I wanted to like it , even going in . Shot obviously for very little cash , I looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration . Unfortunately , although I did appreciate the film on that level , the acting and editing was terrible , and the last 25-30 minutes were severe thumb-twiddling territory . A 95 minute film should not drag . The ratings for this one are good so far , but I fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one . What was with those transitions ?

" An Italian / American co-production co-starring Linda Blair and David ' The Hoff ' Hasselhoff : how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat ? Well , based on the uneventful , extremely tedious , and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so , I would have said ' very easily ' ; thankfully , however , things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes , and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy , a smattering of nudity too ( unfortunately , my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material ) .The Hoff stars as Gary , a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie ( Leslie Cumming ) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project , a book about witches ; whilst there , frustrated Gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity.His plans for nookie are scuppered , however , by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks ( Robert Champagne and Annie Ross ) , their pregnant daughter Jane ( Blair ) , son Tommy ( Michael Manchester ) , pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan ( Catherine Hickland ) , and estate agent Jerry ( Rick Farnsworth ) , who have come to inspect the island 's hotel.After explaining their unexpected presence on the island , Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property 's new owners , and when a violent storm suddenly picks up , making it perilous to return to the mainland , everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building . Unfortunately , unbeknownst to the hotel 's new guests , the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch ( Hildegard Knef ) , who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life . One by one , victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex ( which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs ) , before meeting a terrible fate.None of this makes much sense , and the acting is atrocious ( Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad , whilst Hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers , which speaks volumes about the others ) , but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore : Rose has her lips sewn together , before being roasted alive in a fireplace ; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive ; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish ( ! ! ) ; Freddie 's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood ; and Gary gets stabbed in the back.Oh , and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possessed ( again ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Broadway musical , " " A Chorus Line " " is arguably the best musical in theatre . It 's about the experiences of people who live for dance ; the joys they experience , and the sacrifices they make . Each dancer is auditioning for parts in a Broadway chorus line , yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite . The film version , though , captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show , and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical , as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance , whatsoever . The biggest mistake was made in giving the director 's job to Sir Richard Attenborough , whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for " " Gandhi . " " Why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place ? Which brings us to the next problem . " " A Chorus Line " " takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes . It 's the least flashy of Broadway musicals , and its simplicity was its glory . However , that doesn 't translate well to film , and no one really thought that it would . For that reason , the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers , and should have left the theatre and audition process . The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet , jazz or tap class . Heck , they could have danced down Broadway in their lively imaginations . Yet , not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film , as Attenborough 's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction.Many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director ( Michael Douglas ) whether he wants to hear them or not . Douglas ' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear , and to whom he has no patience . While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play , some heretical changes were made . The very beautiful " " Hello Twelve , Hello Thirteen , Hello Love " " --a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence--was removed and replaced with the dreadful , " " Surprise , " " a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar . Adding insult to injury , " " Surprise " " simply retold the same story as " " Hello , Love " " but without the wit or pathos.There is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to film . If you want to see a film version of this show , the next closest thing is Bob Fosse 's brilliant " " All That Jazz . " " While Fosse 's daughter is in " " A Chorus Line , " " HE is the Fosse who should have been involved , as director . He would have known what to do with this material , which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" By the time this movie came out in 1996 , director Mark Lester had been making tight , sharp little B action pictures for more than 20 years . He was responsible for the great " " Truck Stop Women " " from the ' 70s and several other little gems ; unfortunately , he 's also responsible for this dud . It 's a shame to see the talented--and still smoking hot--Theresa Russell wasted yet again , but she 's still the best actor in this picture . Eric Roberts shows up for a while , does his Eric Roberts thing , then goes away , a not altogether unwelcome occurrence in a picture with Eric Roberts in it . Frank Stallone actually isn 't bad , which should give you an idea of how truly pathetic this picture is . As has been mentioned by other reviewers , the action scenes--which is the reason a picture like this gets made in the first place--are almost completely illogical and unrealistic , in addition to being somewhat inept . Other than some " " vintage " " clothes and a few old cars , there 's no feel whatever for the 1930s , the era in which this film is set . A by-the-numbers script with irritating lapses in logic and little historical accuracy--this isn 't a documentary , of course , but the filmmakers could have at least TRIED for a little authenticity--and performances that range from grade B to grade school relegate this cheap little quickie to the 4 : 00 a.m. Sunday slot on HBO , which is just where I saw it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD.Television moved out of my life in 1981 , so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means that I 'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers . ( Possible spoiler warning ) The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic " " caveman meets fluffball " " yarn , where a " " charming " " red-blooded he-man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs . The premises that the script 's " " wit " " is based on must have already felt stale around 1950 . It also contains some frankly bad writing , as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain , strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance . I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment , but in this particular case I 'm all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped all over it . In one sense , however , this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans : in addition to the pilot episode , it contains the screen test that landed Willis the job . Both features show to what amazing extent Willis ' acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988 / 89 ( Die Hard 1 , In Country ) . Impressive ! Rating ( and I _ am _ a Bruce Willis fan ) : 2 out of 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Howling II starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by Christopher Lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field , oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason . He says " " for it 's written the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with her blood . And I saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication 's and upon her forehead was written , behold I am the great Mother of # an inaudible word I couldn 't make out no matter how many times I rewound the tape and tried to , sorry # and all abominations of the Earth " . " This opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre . After the opening credits which are set over shots of Transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we 're in ' Los Angeles , California U.S.A. City of the Angels ' . I knew I was in for a long 86 minutes . It 's probably not too long after the events of the original Howling ( 1981 ) and it 's Karen White 's funeral . After the ceremony Karen 's brother Ben ( Reb Brown ) is spoken to by an ' occult investigator ' called Stefan Crosscoe ( Christopher Lee ) who says that Karen is a Werewolf and that she will come back to life . Ben dismisses such nonsense . But together with one of Karen 's friends and colleagues Jenny ( Annie McEnroe ) he visits Stefan at his home . There Stefan tells them about Werewolves and how they can be killed , he mentions Stirba ( Sybil Danning ) who is the queen of Werewolves . Stefan also shows them a photograph taken at Karen 's funeral of a woman named Mariana ( Marsha A. Hunt ) and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous Werewolf who wants Karen . Stefan says he will stake any Werewoves through the heart with titanium . Ben figures out that Stefan means he will stake Karen as well so together with Jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister 's crypt is to stop Stefan . However lots of Werewolves turn up and attack Stefan , Ben and Jenny . They survive the attack and manage to find out that Stirba is to be found in Transylvania . They all decide to travel to Transylvania and stop Stirba and her Werewolves from taking over the Earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse . Once there they travel to a small town called Vlkava which means ' where wolves live ' and meet up with the local priest , Father Florin ( Ladislav Krecmer ) and his small but loyal group of Werewolf hunters , hey what else can I call them ? Oh , and a dwarf named Florica ( Ludmila Safarova ) helps too . They follow Mariana who they hope will lead them to Stirba . But Stirba knows of Stefan 's arrival and has plans for him Ben and Jenny . Will Stefan be able to put an end to Stirba 's plans for world domination ? Will this film get any more bizarre or surreal ? Watch it and find out . Directed by Philippe Mora this is one strange mess of a film . It 's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently . The single biggest problem is the script by Robert Sano and Gary Brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn 't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like . Luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring , unlike the original . Something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained . Most people will probably hate it , but for those of us who enjoy ' bad ' films this is right up there with the best of them . There are Werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch . We get some cool Werewolf killing weaponry . The sets and locations just seem so out of place and I don 't know if this was actually shot in Transylvania but it doesn 't look like what I thought mid 80 's Transylvania would . Stirba 's castle is part dungeon , part Gothic castle and part modern luxury house . Stirba and her servant 's costumes are very over-the-top , Stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a S / M video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy , and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too . The special make-up effects range from good to poor , a dwarf 's eyes explode , someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn 't a film loaded with gore , although there are plenty of effect sequences with Werewolf transformations and attacks . There is plenty of nudity as well as Stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of Werewolves ! I should also mention the music , the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that I hated and I ended up turning the volume down . Acting is weak all round and what on Earth was Christopher Lee thinking about when he accepted this film ? ! I wonder what he thinks of it . Basically the whole thing is a real mess , but I found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same . Impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end . Speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage , it also features the same shot of Sybil Danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times ! If that 's your thing . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched Free Money last night & it was the longest 90 + minutes of my life . With such an intriguing cast , I really thought that I was in for a treat - especially since I 'm a Brando fan . WRONG ! What a waste of talent . It 's almost embarrassing to watch at times ( like the cattle prod scene ) , & there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups ( why didn 't they show Charlie Sheen 's character going back to tow Brando 's truck ? ) Ugh . It tries to be a slapstick comedy , but I just wasn 't buying into it . Skip this one . Only for die-hard Brando fans.I 'm giving it 2 out of 10 because I still think the worse movie ever made was Skidoo . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I think this is one of the weakest of the Kenneth Branagh Shakespearian works . After such great efforts as Much Ado About Nothing , etc . I thought this was poor . The cast was weaker ( Alicia Silverstone , Nivoli , McElhone ? ? ? ) but my biggest gripe was that they messed with the Bard 's work and cut out some of the play to put in the musical / dance sequences.You just don 't do Shakespeare and then mess with the play . Sorry , but that is just wrong . I love some Cole Porter just like the next person , but jeez , don 't mess with the Shakespeare . Skip this and watch " " Prospero 's Books " " if you want to see a brilliant Shakespearean adaptation of the Tempest . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If only he hadn 't bowed to clich챕 , Mr Shiban could have actually made a good film from this story . It was just different enough to keep you interested , so for the same amount of time , energy and money as was spent on this stinker , we might have had something good instead of eye-rolling.Production-wise , it is as good as one could really expect from a hand-held camcorder , so he gets good marks there . It 's really the script that 's at fault , as the acting wasn 't all that bad , either , considering what the actors had to work with.I thought the days were long gone when we would see someone , finding a radio transceiver they desperately wish to operate , first turn every knob on the thing from end to end , bash it on top 6 or 7 times , and then expect it to work . This story is ruined by a continuous string of stupid moves by all the characters except the bad guy . It 's as though we are thought to be too shallow to grasp all the plot devices , so they are all spoon-fed to us to make sure we get them.I don 't know about you , but that doesn 't work on me . My attention ends up being occupied by the plot holes and over-dramatizations , not the story.So , since I found this to be not so bad in the technical sense , I think Mr. Shiban should try again , only with a proper script next time ; then he might give us something worth watching . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of Boris Karloff 's real clinkers . Essentially the dying Karloff ( looking about 120 years older than he was ) is a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies . Moving from Morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the South of France where he works a s physician while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories . Desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who is dying . She will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a gigolo ( who I think is married ) . If you think I got that from watching the movie you 're wrong , I had to read what other people posted to figure out happened . Why ? because this movie had me lost from two minutes in.I had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple converging plot lines . Little is spelled out and much isn 't said until towards the end by which time I really didn 't care . Its a dull mess of interest purely for Karloff 's performance which is rather odd at times . To be honest this is the only time I 've ever seen him venture into Bela Lugosi bizarre territory . Its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung out . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I must , in light of the encomia of praise for this flick from viewers , assume once again the role of the turd in the punchbowl , as Lowell Weicker used to say , I am scratching my head at the sheer number of laudatory comments . " " The African Queen " " this ain 't . The period flavor is wonderful , yes . The acting is fine , but no actor no matter how great can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant party and dinner table conversation here , and I care not how much of it is taken from Joyce 's text . Imagine spending an hour and a half as a fly on the wall at a Christmas dinner of a not particularly interesting group of people ( it 's not clear to me that it 's a family , as one person suggested ) , having to listen to their mundane table talk , and you have the essential experience of this movie . Absolutely nothing happens . And nothing important is said , but it is said at interminable length . As I said , the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me . Speaking of mysteries , watch a good one rather than this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Most of the episodes on Season 1 are awful .. There is no comparison to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits , as they programs actually had decent story lines . Most of Amazing Stories are well dull .. not amazing in the least .. go rent or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I have heard Season 2 of this series is much better .. also for some reason on the DVD 's they cut out the Ray Walston parts which further diminishes this compilation . The one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of Sherlock Holmes . Apparently Matt Frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny . His skull-like face made for a good zombie in the Dawn of the Dead remake , but as Sherlock Holmes he looks like a scarecrow . Not only does Frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch , but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical Holmes overcoats that he is wearing . Not only that , but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap . So his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester . Whatever the cap was made of , it looked very new and artificial . Jeremy Brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits , but Brett did not have to dress-up like Sherlock Holmes in order to look the part . Frewer on the other hand is painful to watch . Even in the full " " Holmes " " outfit , he does not carry himself like Sherlock Holmes.Frewer 's cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad " " Upper-Crust " " British accent is painful to see and listen to . To say that Frewer is overacting is an understatement . After he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum , he then sneers as if that were some kind of British trait . When I started watching this I thought it might be a comedy featuring Wishbone , the Jack Russell Terrier . I thought Frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for Wishbone . But sadly , there is no dog in this movie except for Frewer . Wishbone would have made this movie a lot better.Not only does Frewer 's version of Sherlock Holmes never stop talking ( in that awfully artificial British nasal accent ) , but he is much to friendly and kind . Frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to , and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a Charm School instead of being a Sleuth . Perhaps since this is a Hallmark Channel production , they are trying to make a children 's version of Sherlock Holmes ( Wishbone was better at that , too ) that was kindler and gentler . Whatever the point of Frewer 's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes , it is flatter than a pancake , and easily the worst version of Sherlock Holmes that I have ever seen ( including the previous worst , by Charlton Heston ) .Overall , the tone of this film is awful . It reminded me of a typical episode of Barnaby Jones or Murder She Wrote or Diagnosis Murder . All the suspects over-acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed . Holmes and Watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie . Even on Murder She Wrote there is less exposition.This Sherlock Holmes does not even compare very well to Jim Rockford of the Rockford Files and it is miles below Columbo . The awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer . It is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with Sherlock Holmes , especially the BBC version with Jeremy Brett . This movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of Little House on the Prairie . The fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help.The only minor bright spot is Ken Walsh who plays Doctor Watson with some dignity . Walsh does not ham it up compared to Frewer , and when he is often interviewing witnesses , his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible . Unfortunately , the rest of the cast is amateurish , and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other ( to show they are suspicious ) is something that I had not seen in any modern movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" You know those movies that are so unspeakably bad that you have to laugh ? Half-caste wasn 't one of them . Which sounds good , right ? But no , it 's not . It 's not a bad attempt at a horror movie that 's fun to watch because it 's lame , or not well acted , or has bad special effects or anything else like that . No , Half-caste is just plain boring . They don 't even make an attempt to be scary until the last 20 minutes are so . It 's just kids running around in the African bush country and getting high off of elephant dung for the first 75 % of the movie , and it 's not even funny . The last 20 minutes , though , are HILARIOUS . I have no idea what happened , but it was really fun to watch that CGI leopard rip out the throats of all of those white guys I couldn 't tell apart anyway . If you 're in the mood for a bad horror movie , don 't rent this one , because you 'll go to sleep before they get to the fun stuff . If you do accidentally rent this movie , I 'd recommend fast forwarding to the end , and skipping any scene that happens in daylight . You won 't miss anything . You won 't have any idea which character is which or exactly what is going on even if you do watch all of the back-story . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is. with a plot that makes your average middle-school writer look good , and acting which is almost as good , it gets my bottom score. one of tom hanks very early films where he obviously didn 't have the pleasure to be real picky. the best special effect of the movie consists of a guy dressed up in an incredibly fake rubber monster consume . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The main actor in the movie is a pompous jackass and both guy and girl in the film are way too modest to be in a film like this . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE . The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 1 is that they used at least a somewhat attractive girl in the movie and towards the end you got to see almost full frontal nudity from the girl , thats it , thats the only thing thats worth watching it for. the end , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is quite possibly the worst Christmas film ever . The plot is virtually non-existent , the acting ( Affleck in particular ) is poor at best .

As far as I could gather the plot consisted of Ben Affleck , a millionaire salesman , is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood . On doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for Christmas ... and that is it .

" What an awful movie . I love monster flicks but I couldn 't watch even half of the terrible acting , cardboard characters and abysmal special effects . There is nothing redeeming about this movie . The characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous , uninspiring sock puppets . The plot is formulaic , cut and paste , standard science-run-amok drivel . Even the CGI is horrible . You know it 's bad when you can 't even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy . No surprises here , just same old same old . This is truly one of the worst films ever made .

" In my humble opinion , this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things going for it - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script . ( OK Vanessa Williams is good to watch . ) But to me that 's all there is . Most of the cast seem to be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and no wonder people walk over Harry McAfee when it 's played by George Wendt who looks like he 'd rather be back on a bar stool in Boston . Jason Alexander is passable , but that wig has to go and I saw better dancing in Bugsy Malone . As I mentioned , it 's good to have a version of the stage script now , but I hope the young out there , who have never seen a musical , DON 'T judge them all by this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As others have mentioned , this movie is similar to THE FLY ( both versions ) and the lesser known sci-fi flick ALTERED STATES . The big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it . METAMORPHOSIS did not have these advantages . METAMORPHOSIS is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the roles.The story follows scientist Dr. Peter Houseman ( Gene LeBrock ) , an obsessed man working on a genetic cure to aging and death . When the university he works for threatens to cut funding , he decides to inject the anti-aging serum into himself . As a result , Dr. Houseman spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard . And oh yes , watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy . It really is so bad that it 's good . Some of the lines are classic : " " What WAS it ? " " " " A nightmare ... from the past ! " " Many of the reviews that I 've read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are . I 'm just going to go ahead and spoil it : the good doctor goes from being a shuffling half-man , half-lizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected Godzilla costume , when the police finally gun him down . In the final scene , some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die , and the movie 's heroine , Sally Donnelly ( Catherine Baranov ) evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of Dr. Houseman . The camera then gives us a close-up of the lizard 's face ; this is , I assume , the director 's way of showing us that the lizard is EVIL . Yes , it is goofy , but I fell over laughing so I can 't complain.I watched this movie because it was a part of the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Megapack that I purchased . I 'm sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing , as the 50 pack is the only way to see this movie on DVD . If you have recently bought the boxed set and haven 't watched this movie yet , it really is worth your time , even if I did just ruin the ending for you . It might also be possible to find this movie online for free . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I was in school I made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking , and I realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a clich챕 of Canadian cinema : sodden lyricism married to vacant , metaphor-burdened stabs at social commentary . But whatever my own film 's failings I feel much better after seeing this ... this ... thing . For one thing , mine ran 20 minutes , not 85 , and had more content at that : every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four , five , six relentless minutes . The male lead is just incredible , a brow-beating , loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of drama-class improv in between philosophical insights culled from the U of T pub , and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him . Admittedly if he weren 't such an a * * hole then the third act would make even less sense , as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of ' exploitation ' values ; but it doesn 't make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper " " please " " in closeup until the magazine runs out . I take back what I said about AUTUMN BORN , which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery : this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst Canadian movie of all time .

" * * * * * * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this " " film " . " first of all , we think it is hilarious that the producer cameoed in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horrible unbelieveably unbelievable accent -- what the hell was that anyway , romanian ? And how is it that in Denmark no one speaks danish except the bog creatures ? ( Note , the scottish camp director ... ) . ? And who does the shopping for the bog creatures ? Their pants looked like they were purchased at Banana Republic . Very nicely dressed for being 1200 years old . This one was worse than Scarecrow Slayer ( we didn 't think that was even POSSIBLE ) . We basically fast forwarded through 75 % of the movie looking for any gore / death / scary moments . None found . Do rent the DVD just to watch the 2 hour " " Behind the Scenes of Bog Creatures " " featurette . Who are these people ? Are they serious ? And the filmmakers are like 60 years old .

" I saw this movie in part because of some positive comments here on IMDb . After wishing I had those 90 minutes of my life back , I feel it 's my duty to get on here myself and say ... Please don 't bother watching this movie.I can 't argue with the actors efforts - they did what they could given the material , but that material is dreadful . The pace was deadly - slow , meandering , and you saw everything coming about an hour away , and then it took forever to happen . The dialogue was boring , pointless , not funny at all . The characters were all completely unsympathetic . And the cinematography was , in my opinion , very low quality - the clich챕 of " " character uses home video machine !

" 6 out of the 8 comments on this subject rated this film as worth watching , so let me redress the balance.If this is the best that British Independent film makers have to offer then they need to pack away their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry . Unfortunately for me that was 82 minutes I 'll never see again and hopefully I 'll save some of you from wasting 82 minutes of your own . Whilst the idea behind the film is interesting , it is not developed enough to keep the viewer attached . The student characters are bland and uninteresting and quite frankly you won 't care about what happens to them . The soldiers are practically caricatures of every baddie ever seen in film , I kept waiting for Captain Markovic to twirl an imaginary moustache . Some of the effects were quite good and showed some imagination , but these were ruined by the shockingly bad acting , poor script writing and patchy camera work . The budget may have been better spent sending the " " actors " " ( and I use that term loosely ) to acting classes or the Thomas Brothers to film making school or maybe on a spell checker because the subtitles were incorrectly spelt . The fact that the mis-spellings were not picked up on and rectified speaks volumes about the immaturity of the whole production.I can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the film makers , either that or they were watching a completely different film . I implore the Thomas Brothers to never give up their day jobs for if they continue in this field , they will surely starve to death . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I didn 't care much for this , it seemed too contrived for a documentary . Also , the filmmakers seemed to steer me towards certain characters , and yet I was completely unsympathetic towards the protagonist because of what they chose to show me of him.This movie disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting , yet the movie fell flat because of snappy editing that didn 't allow the viewer enough time to understand each scene . The developments in the story were glossed over in lieu of showing the men in boxers or other stuff that was incidental to the tale that they were telling.I 'd recommned that you skip this one and just read up on this story . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" God , I was bored out of my head as I watched this pilot . I had been expecting a lot from it , as I 'm a huge fan of James Cameron ( and not just since " " Titanic " , " I might add ) , and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality ( Then again , he also wrote the leaden Strange Days .. ) . But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration . In all that time , it barely went beyond its two line synopsis , and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere . On top of that , I don 't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular " " A-Team " " episode . As for Alba , yes , she is gorgeous , of course , but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie ( pouty and surly ) , makes me also get bored of her " " gal wit an attitude " " schtick pretty soon .

" Unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event , but doesnt have the balls to legitimately document what happened . The constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame ( I get the impression Ben Coccio is an avid gamer ) , or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message ( we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning ALL their cd 's , talk about subtlety ! ) , but the movie only gets away with it because its ' fiction ' . Nice try . Yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence , but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media ? or video games ? We dont , and we wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely relinquish the media , yet dumb enough to scorch a nazi symbol on the ground ? haha I somehow dont think so.The movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the normalcy of the families , its almost doing a disservice to think that there wasn 't a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates . Why is everyone so concerned with making killers seem " " normal " , " when they are so obviously not ? A completely false and phony depiction . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie had a good story , but was brought down because it didn 't have enough horror film elements and violence . It was like watching a live action cartoon .

" I suppose many people comment / review their first movie on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or horrible -- I 'm writing due to the latter.I was excited for the sequel to " " Wargames " " .. I thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content , I felt it was worth watching more than once . This being 2008 , I had high hopes for what they would do with this film . Computers , Gaming , Terror , Military over-zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film , and " " Wargames : The Dead Code " " had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick.The movie failed on pretty much every level , but I particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects . " " The Dead Code " " was a 1990 's air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms . Meanwhile , Will Farmer is button mashing about 7,000 commands -- none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen . Until finally he " " wins " " by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people ( nobody is near the gas ) . Because he beat 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes , this tells RIPLEY ( the real life war machine ) that he is a high level terror threat.Even though any 5-16 year old could complete this same task - The government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity . They say things like " " He has expert knowledge of bio-terror " " ... He displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the Wiki entry on Bio-Terror . So then a movie-long chase scene with about .01 % of the budget and excitement of any of the Bourne titles ensues . They have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter .. sometimes they are mad they barely miss him .. but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him.Ugh ... I would write more .. but I already wasted 1.5 hours watching this , I would rather watch the Broderick and Joshua play tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Honestly I am not even joking when I say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! This film dosen 't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line . I can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from " " The Omen " " and other movies like it . For example the nanny " " Lucy " " in this film is actually one of the devil 's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of Satan ..... does this sound a lot like Mrs. Baylock to anyone else . Another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted , just like in " " The Omen " . " However luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body .... yet another coincidence ? ? ? ? ? ? And to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus all over the walls , much like the priest in " " The Omen " " having pages of the Bible plastered on the walls like wall-paper .

It is so corny I cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour-and-a-half.The story basically is " " Andy " " ( Mickey Rooney ) trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some d챕butante from New York City as if that was the ultimate . People were a lot more social-conscious in the old days . You 'd hear the term " " social-climber " " as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life . It 's all utter nonsense , of course , and looks even more so today.However , it 's about as innocent and clean a story and series ( there were a half dozen of these Andy Hardy films made ) as you could find . Also , if you like to hear Judy Garland sing , then this is your ticket , as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into Andy 's heart . Oh man , I almost throw up even writing about this ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a CA resident , I 'd like to see the jackholes who were shutting down the electricity plants to raise the prices get some jail time too . I thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces . While they stuck to how Enron rose and crashed , I found it really interesting . However , when the movie focused on it 's anti-Bush slant , it made me wonder if they were really being accurate . It 's fine to point out any connection the Republicans had to Enron , but the monster was created while Clinton was president . The CA energy crisis happened under Davis 's watch . Both were in office during Enron 's abuses , but neither are held accountable in any way . Rather , many minutes are spent on how Bush was friends with Lay . So what ? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom . Why are Democrats given such a free pass in this film ? I think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money so I 'm not partial to either party but I hate feeling like I 'm subject to someone 's political agenda when I watch a documentary . Yes , politicians deserve some blame , but I really doubt that the only guilty one 's have Rs after their names . I found no value in portraying the Bush 's as Kay-lovers when Democrats received just as much Enron campaign money as Republicans did . Like I said , it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Written and acted by sincere amateurs , produced by some exploitation monger , this is dull and hard to watch.Not the worst movie ever , but at least schlock like _ Plan 9 From Outer Space _ usually had a real actor or two .

" The first half of the movie is not that bad actually . Although there 's not really too much depth in the characters , the story is somehow funny and generally OK with potential to get better , which it doesn 't.In the second half things start to turn for the worse , not only for the characters in the movie , but also for the viewer , who will be basically waiting for the story to come to its obvious end.The previous user comment mentioned : " " It 's a love story , a road movie , a thriller , a comedy of errors , an 80 's movie and most of all , it 's a Jonathan Demme movie . " " Well , please allow me to rephrase that : " " It 's a boy gets girl story , they happen to be driving around in cars , the thrill is gone as it is all too clear how things will evolve , there wasn 't any scene in this film to which one might laugh out loud , it does have some slight 80 's feeling and yes , Jonathan Demme really was the director .

" I enjoyed the first reviewer 's comment far more than I did the film when I saw it at a second-run theatre in the early ' 80 's . I was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the Tenniel drawings . But to me , the cast was largely squandered , their personalities muffled by the masks , while the direction I think of as being unusually static , and the photography murky . The rating jotted down at the time was a nought , which means " " not worth sitting through even once " . " Still , I too would jump at a chance to have a second look . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The emergence of Quentin Tarantino and his dubious influence on the likes of Guy Ritchie may have triggered the wave of appalling British gangster flicks we 've been bequeathed over the past few years , but one of our most famous acting exports only serves to perpetuate the cycle by lending his considerable name to trash like this . I only wish he 'd taken a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain he admits he often employs . It 's not only stifling HIS talent , but possibly the promise of future originality from British films . Not one of this film 's characters are likeable or even remotely realistic , and the dialogue consists of the usual empty threats and colourful language . Caine doesn 't give the material any more effort than it deserves , either . If this was meant to be in the style of a tragic fall from grace a la " " King Lear " , " it would 've helped immensely had I cared about the ultimate fate of the principals , instead of just wishing that they 'd get mired in the quicksand of life and dragged under almost immediately . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Although I had previously watched this one some time ago on Italian TV , I found it to be a surprisingly tolerable potboiler this time round , buoyed by an international cast of familiar faces ( including a bemused Joseph Cotten as the Baron ) and , contrary to many another film of the Euro-Cult sub-genre , an incident-packed plot in place of lethargic pacing.The creature itself looks a bit dodgy and Cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an eager scientist still dabbling in creating life-forms out of corpses ( one would have thought that he would have made himself an army of them by now and not struggling at perfecting his technique still ) but Ms. Neri does look good in and out of costume and reliable Herbert Fux probably comes off best as a lecherous grave-robber / blackmailer . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I suppose all the inside jokes is what made Munchies a cult classic . I thought it was awful , though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters , it probably could 've been a much better ( and funnier ) movie . Maybe all they needed was a real budget.Munchies , as many viewers have pointed out already , is something of a Gremlins parody . Hence , all the references to the movie . The movie begins somewhere in Peru during an archeological dig . An annoying dufus named Paul , aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans , is holed up with his dad in the caves . His dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist , searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything , but proof of U.F.O. ' s . And that 's where the Munchies come into the picture . Hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a Gizmo voice . They name him Arnold , stash him in a bag , and bring him home so Paul 's dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial life.Paul , the idiot that he is , breaks his promise to his dad to watch Arnold ( a wager he made with his dad , if he loses , it 's off to community college to get a ' real ' career ) . The creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug , Cecil ( television veteran Harvey Korman ) , wonders what his neighbors are up to . So , he and his lazy son , some airhead hippie type ( who looks more like they should 've made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast ) to go and snatch Arnold . Why ? A get rich quick scheme of course . And of course , even Cecil 's son is too dumb to look after Arnold . And after a few pokes and prods at Arnold , he multiplies into more Munchies.This wasn 't even a movie that was so bad it was good . It was just plain awful . I was hoping that the Munchies would 've mutated and killed the morons that were always after them , even Paul and his girlfriend . At least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really hams up the movie . Not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets . And really bad writing all around--it wasn 't even funny--not even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal twitch in your eye . Like I said , Munchies , if they had been given an actual budget and better actors , they might 've been able to pull off a good parody . Pass . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I went into this film really wanting to like it - it headlined a film festival earlier in the year , and boasted an all-star cast . But ( and you could tell there was a " " but " " coming ) it 's a failure of a film . Outstanding character acting by Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by editing and the antics of the supporting cast . Turturro 's performance is lackluster , and most of the comedy is overplayed . The recurring puppet shows are pointless , and a few scenes are completely out of place.That said , there are some wonderful moments sprinkled in the film . A genuinely touching stage moment , several of the seductions , and a few of the comedic color actually work out . Unfortunately , they 're overshadowed by the diffuse , incoherent script and some bad acting . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Opening with some blatantly reused footage from ' Kit for Cat ' , ' Tweety 's S.O.S ' fails to live up to that classic cartoon . Instead , we get an example of Friz Freleng 's Tweety and Sylvester series at its most generic . Unlike Chuck Jones 's Road Runner series , which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting , Freleng 's series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place . ' Tweety 's S.O.S ' , then , basically amounts to " " this time let 's put ' em on a boat " . " It 's not an entirely weak cartoon . There are a few good jokes , mostly involving Granny 's glasses , but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off ( the seasickness routine ) and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than Tweety says " " I tawt I taw a putty tat " , " a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns . ' Tweety 's S.O.S ' will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it 's definitely one to avoid . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Princess Warrior is a science fiction action movie with a pretty thin plot-essentially on the death of their queen mother two sisters , one evil and one good , fight for control of the throne . The good sister is being beaten so she escapes to Earth where she appears buck naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet t-shirt contest . The rest of the movie is basically one long chase scene , as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister . But the younger sister is helped by Bob , a good-hearted DJ , and everything is complicated by police involvement and the good sister 's ignorance of Earth customs and culture . The older sister catches up to her younger sibling several times but the latter manages to escape and go on the run again . Throughout all of this action , there is a cult of women on the home planet having some kind of a space age s챕ance to bring the good sister back . Sadly a good portion of this film seems to be rather boring car chase scenes as they drive around Los Angeles ( and what was that sound effect when the police car crashed ? ? ? ) The film culminates in another physical fight between the sisters with a predictable ending.It seems to borrow elements from Star Wars ( the light sabers and the look of the girls ' home planet in the opening and subsequent scenes ) , Dr. Who ( the phone booth like means of transportation ) and some of the costumes ( from the cult on the home planet ) could have been taken from Star Trek episodes.Ms. Dana Fredsti ( the evil sister in the movie ) in another user comment mentioned " " the endless ( and dull ) wet T-shirt contest . It is seriously the longest wet T-shirt contest in cinema history . And the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial strength cotton-polyester shirts that defied all efforts to get them wet and translucent . " " I couldn 't state it any better . The only thing I would add is that the music in this scene is just plain annoying.Most of the acting is pretty over the top , but that seems to suit the whole style of the movie . The actors playing Vinnie and Vito were just too much for me-I just found them annoying . Ms. Fredsti ( Curette ) seemed to be enjoying herself and not taking the whole thing too seriously , in contrast to Sharon Lee Jones who acted decently but seemed to be taking everything more seriously . All of the police were portrayed as bumbling idiots , presumably to add comic relief , which is a bit unnecessary , given that the whole movie was rather comical.From a ratings perspective , this film had a lot of foul language ; some topless women and others scantily clad in thongs , but not enough skin to satisfy those who are looking for nudity ; one sex scene that was portrayed in a non-graphic arty dreamlike fashion ; and little violence-while there were threats of violence throughout , the scenes of both sword fighting and brawling were exaggerated , and too camp to be " " offensive " , " though it looked like the actors were having a lot of fun with it.I have to wonder who came up with the character names ? Ovule ( a small egg ) , Curette ( a surgical instrument used for scraping and cleaning ) , Exzema ( suspiciously similar to a disease characterized by scaling skin and pruritus ) , Bulemia ( an eating disorder with binging and purging ) and Rickettsia ( another disease ) ? Overall , this is a bad , low budget , campy , sci-fi action movie , but it did keep me entertained , though I might need a few drinks before watching it again . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am a massive fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favourite writer ever since studying Animal Farm at GCSE . I bought the DVD out of sheer curiosity , Burton is an actor I hold in high regard so when I heard that he played the role of O 'Brien I was swung.I watched the trailer on the DVD first and some fears started to set in , mostly regarding the frankly terrible " " Theme song " , " hearing the Eurythmics mechanically shouting " " 1984 ! " " over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds.The acting on a whole is pretty good , Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt , especially in the harrowing Room 101 scene . However this is also where the movie is let down . The movie spends too much time focusing on the Love affair between Winston and Julia , which frankly isn 't what Orwell was writing about . He was writing about a harrowing future , about how Ingsoc build up a mans beliefs and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love Big Brother . The movie skips over what is essentially the most important part of the book , Winstons coming to terms with his position in life and the world , and his re-education via O 'Brien.The comment on IMDb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect . Julia is not present when Winston visits O 'Brien , they do not commit themselves to Goldstien 's Brotherhood and confess their crimes . There is no obvious mention of the initial instances where Winston finds the article with the Unpersons but it does get mentioned near the end , if you have not read the book it is completely confusing.A terrible screenplay , which some excellent acting cannot rescue . Michael Radford seems to have completely missed the point Orwell was trying to make , and the electronica sound track is frankly terrible . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it 's not all about being beautiful on the outside . The inside counts for something too . A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls . I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season . About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel . Recently , Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual . I felt that she should have done more to encourage her . It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look . Tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl out . Instead , the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism . It 's a shame because I truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons . There 's a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD and Top Model only has 1 season on DVD . It 's called taste .

Although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could .. Still it really ruin the movie for me .. The twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills .. The movie drags to long for the supposed shocking conclusion .. All in all I have seen worse low budget movies but considering this was hype with the 8 films to die for I was very disappointed .. By the way , were did some reviewers say there was gore and stuff .

" I don 't want to go too far into detail , because I can 't really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film , but I had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie . The animation is crud and the story alternates between boring / pointless to extremely irritating . The humor was completely lost on the audience , and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans , this is NOT an action sci-fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy , and the humor just did not work after being translated . It was a total chore to watch this movie , and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest , especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for anything - I wasn 't expecting a Ghost in the Shell sequel , but I was expecting something entertaining , and it simply didn 't achieve this . Yaaawwnnn ... Rent Kino 's Journey instead . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This straight to video cheap flick is based on a true story . I don 't doubt it . Doesn 't mean it 's particularly interesting ( unless you are one of the main characters who actually lived though this experience ) . A young woman named Angela buys a great , big old country home really really cheap . Well , as we all know from watching Horror movies , when you buy a big house cheap it usually means it 's haunted in some way , shape or form . In fact , the second the house is being handed over to Angela the wise guy kid who lived in the house up to now takes a moment to " " introduce " " Angela to one of the ghosts ! Nice guy , huh ? Angela gets in touch with a psychic and a paranormal expert and tells them that her house is haunted and invites them to come over and see the ghosts for themselves . They come to a party and sure enough there are ghosts walking around , sitting on the couch , hanging in the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom . A few friends sleep over the night of the party , see the ghosts and vow never to come back in the house again . ( Check out the girl who deadpans " " I 'm so scared . I 'm so scared . " " totally emotionless . If she was so scared why didn 't she get up , turn the knob and leave ? ! ) The ghosts don 't really do anything menacing aside from show up ( And there is no blurriness or aura about them . They look just like regular people ) . They steal celery from the kitchen , move chairs around a la POLTERGEIST and one bisexual female ghost seduces Angela , who , get this , doesn 't seem to mind ! This scene plays like the kind of soft-core porn you see on the SPICE channel . ( Ummm ... not that I 'd KNOW ! Hahaha ) . The actresses aren 't your typical porn stars though . They should hit the beach and the gym more . When Angela 'ss NOT making love to the dead she gets mad at them and stands alone in a room screaming " " Why won 't you leave ? ! This is MY house ! Get out ! " " They don 't leave . I couldn 't help but think of all the times I 've heard psychic Sylvia Brown on TV saying that if you have a ghost in your house you should calmly rationalize with the ghost and say " " Look , you 're dead . It 's time to cross over to the other side . In other words , get out ! " " According to Sylvia Brown , as long as your not hostile and nasty about it , they 'll leave ! This movie looks like it cost about $ 50 to make . It has a really cheap feel , and bad acting . I could have made this movie with 5 friends and a camcorder . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What a time we live in when someone like this Joe Swan-whatever the hell is considered a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker at all ! Where are the new crop of filmmakers with brains AND talent ? ? ? We need them bad , and to hell with mumblecore ! This movie is about nothing , just as the characters in the film stand for nothing . It 's this horrible , so-called Gen Y , that is full of bored idiots , some of which declare themselves filmmakers with out bothering to learn anything about the craft before shooting . Well , Orson Welles was a filmmaker . John Huston was a filmmaker . Fellini was a filmmaker . Dreyer was a filmmaker , etc . Current films like these show just how stupid young , so-called " " filmmakers " " can be when they believe going out with no script , no direction , no thought , no legit " " camerawork " " ( everything shot horribly on DV ) , no craft of editing , no nothing , stands for " " rebellious " " or " " advanced " " film-making . Nope , it 's called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of cinema ( and there actually is an in-your-face " " jack-off shot , " " so be ready ) . Look at the early films of any accomplished " " indie " " filmmaker : Linklatter , Morris , Allen , Lynch , Hartley , Jarmusch , Jost , Lee , or Herzog ... none made anything as tedious and aimless as this , yet Swan-whatever the hell , is still going to SXSW every year and hailed as some kind of gutsy , new talent . It 's crap ! I can 't imagine anyone liking this , and everything else this so-called filmmaker has done ( all seen by me ) is just as bad ( the newer stuff clearly made to appeal to a more mainstream audience , one of the sitcom calling ) . Steer clear , unless you 're a friend or family member of those involved ... on second thought , if you 're a family member or friend you 'd probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations ...

" This movie deserves credit for its original approach . It combines elements of theater , film , and epic storytelling . Unfortunately , it falls flat on all levels . The films biggest weakness is it 's unwillingness to commit to anything ; it has camp , moralistic , and epic elements without ever committing to any of them . As for the story itself , Chretien de Troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable , unbearably innocent Percival into a most ungallant and rude churl.Most likely two types of people will see this , francophiles or Arthuriophiles .

Communists really did not distinguish between nationalities.Whole movie stinks like fake .

" I just watched this movie in high definition on television . I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating . His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society 's job market is great . And my problem isn 't with the real person who did these things . HE was a great man . But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching , that I found it insulting.First of all , they didn 't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability . Sure they were competent actors , but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually HIRING THE DISABLED for anything in the film . Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches , appearing to have only one leg . But the CGI in this scene is so apparent it is shameful . What ? They couldn 't find an actual amputee anywhere for the film ? For a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just HIRE an ACTUAL amputee ? At that point in the film I found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that I came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple I am.Figure that out . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was looking forward to this movie as everyone was talking about it as being a good horror movie , and finally an European one .

" I have watched THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . I don 't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity.He is obviously not a statistician else the odds of 2 / 1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in GodHe regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do God . One has only to look at the language used in his postulations . Regarding Faith . This commodity is used extensively in everyday behaviour . Just think about it . When he gets in an electrician be believes that it will be wired correctly and trustfully turns on the switch . When he gets in a plumber he pulls the chain in his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction . Regarding faith in science When I was in chemistry class I believed and was taught that the atom was the smallest particle and the onion skin theory of electrons both of which have now been discounted . I was taught this as the atomic theory ' writ in stone ' so to speak . So why should we believe any scientist especially when he goes beyond the parameters of his field ? Dawkins states that religion will be the downfall of civilisation . Religion is civilisation . Can he , or any other atheist , please tell us what civilisation was founded and nurtured by atheism , barbarism or savagery please ? He is now living in the last stages of a Christian based civilisation and taking all the benefits from it without any admission for its source . I found Dawkins to be arrogant , dictatorial , judgmental , an obvious believer in eugenics and a Nazi in his attitude towards the young . How dare he say what a parent can teach their child . The child is theirs , not the nation 's and as the parents bequeath to it their genetics , so do they bequeath their beliefs . His dismissal of Adam as " " he never existed " " as he has no proof was an example of this same attitude . So I have no proof that Joe Blogs lives in New York but he well may do . I just haven 't found the proof yet . That does not negate his existence I note his argument with the Bishop of Oxford that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the Bible . Well , Dawkins also does this . Where does he draw the line between it as a historical document and a religious statement ? He is also selective . I heard the lot when Dawkins came up with the ALTRUISTIC gene . What a hoot . He is desperately looking for proof for his wackiness and as the Piltdown Man was invented , so now we have this so called ALTRUISTIC gene which predisposes us to looking after our young and other members of our ' group ' The trouble is that all animals do this - not just apes , and with evolution it is survival of the fittest. not the kindest and if he really thinks we are becoming kinder as a race he is not reading the same newspapers as I am I found his arrogance beyond belief in declaiming that as we only have this life , we should enjoy it to the full . So how does he equate this with his obvious position as a well off European to a destitute person in Africa who has had all her family wiped out and probably raped and is starving . Will he help her ? I note that all his opposition to religion is a ) that they go to war . Well G K Chesterton declared that the only war worth fighting was a war for religion b ) we are against using contraception and abortion and homosexuality . All sins against the 6th commandment . Funny that.As a Catholic I find his dismissal of Pius XII 's pronouncement of the Dogma of the Assumption in 1958 to be erroneous . He , Pius , never said that it was revealed to him while he was sitting somewhere by himself . In case Dawkins does not know it , Revelation ended with the last Apostle . Pius would have taken years of advice and studied documents handed from down over the centuries to have come up with this pronouncement . Also as a Catholic I find his dismissal of all religious people as satisfied. what utter rubbish . We , everyday fight the world , the flesh and the devil . We are the Church Militant . We are also able to glory at a sunset and admire the beauties of nature even if we believe in God . The trouble with Dawkins was that he interviewed whacky zealots and extrapolated them to all of us . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Warped take on the Pinocchio theme , and set during the Christmas season ( .. after the previous entry abandoned ties to Christmas ) has booby-trapped toys sent to murder a child ( .. yet through this , other victims are accidentally harmed in the process ) perhaps by a toy maker 's " " son " . " Screaming Mad George was responsible for the killer toys ( .. including a larvae which enters a victim 's mouth and out his eye , another where soldier toys actually shoot real bullets at a babysitter after her boyfriend was practically strangled by a severed hand toy , operating from a remote control ) . The little target is a mute child named Derek ( William Thorne ) whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face , causing him to land on a fireplace poker . Mother Sarah ( Jane Higginson ) worries about her son 's mental state , figuring his reluctance towards opening presents or , more importantly , talking , derives from watching her husband 's horrific murder . Derek 's real father , Noah ( Tracy Fraim ) fears for his son 't safety , and informs , reluctantly , his ex-girlfriend Sarah that the local toymaker , Joe Petto ( Mickey Rooney ) once was arrested for setting traps in toys to harm kids due to the loss of an unborn child when his wife was killed in a car crash .. kind of a retaliation in saying that if he couldn 't have a son , then others shouldn 't either . Still quite a heavy drinker ( .. often seen swigging Jack ) , Petto seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids , but his creepy son Pino ( Brian Bremer ) hasn 't and Derek he harbors angst towards . Why ? You 'll soon understand.Pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise . Rooney 's name adds an allure to the film , gaining it a notoriety , but his histrionics can only help so much . Attractive lead actress Higginson ( Slaughterhouse ) and Fraim as the man who re-enters her life aren 't so bad , but the lame plot that develops is hard to take seriously . I 'm guessing that 's the point , but Rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this .. he has no room to bring any personality to his toymaker other than rage and desperation , quite volatile , barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards Pino , when not downing liquor . Bremer is appropriately weird and " " robotic " " as Pino , longing to have Sarah as his mama . The practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing .. Screaming Mad George 's work with Savage Steve Holland was far more effective than what we see in this film . The sex everyone talks about isn 't as gratuitous as many would have you believe ( .. I can 't even recall any nudity ) . Probably the best of the numerous sequels greenlighted , but that 's not exactly an endorsement . I 'm pretty sure written on paper , this was an entertaining concept , the idea of spoofing Pinocchio using horror elements , but the result doesn 't exactly blow you away . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when I got in the room . There was only me and my girlfriend ! This shouted to me that this film is not very good . Not to my surprise , the film was dire . Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas . It is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him . His acting is OKish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good . The plot line is poor and the comedy almost non-existent.However , there are some good points . For example , the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny.I hope this review stops other people wasting their money . I was very embarrassed when I came out of the room ! ! ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Tamara Anderson and her family are moving once again , as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape . Fifteen years old , she is in her rebellious stage . Already angry at her father for their frequent relocations , her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis . Her mother 's absence causes Tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion , the boy next door , Rusty , as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house.The story is modest to a fault . It 's oddly paced , and even during its emotional scenes there isn 't any tension . The actors portraying the parents are fine . Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother , and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt-ridden mother of the dead teenager . But Katie Boland , as Tamara , is too amateurish to carry the movie . The dialog is very natural and Boland can 't quite pull it off . She has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward . One can see her thinking ' ok this is what my line is and this is the face i 'm supposed to make ' rather than actually reacting to the other actors . She 's not the only one , Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park as his sister Brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least they 're in fewer scenes.If done right , the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie . And it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years . It was the first I had ever seen people tortured , so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming , etc . It was brutal ; the worst thing I had ever seen on film.Dr. Clement Molloch , played by Joseph Mayer , is still one of the most evil characters I 've ever seen on film , and I 've viewed thousands . He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again , nor would I recommend it . He makes Hannibal Lecter look like Mr. Rogers . If seeing people tortured is not your idea of fun , then stay away from this film.I know there are a lot of sick people out there , many of them professional film critics , who probably enjoyed this sordid , sick story . It 's a " " B " " movie , anyway , with stupid dialog and some wooden acting by Charles Bronson . This is not one of his better efforts . Even if it was , there so many horrendous scenes in here you wouldn 't want to watch . Trust me on this one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" All this dismaying waste of film stock needs is Count Floyd popping up every sixty seconds . Somehow they got Steve Railsback , Susan Anspach , John Vernon , and Joe Flaherty together on a set and couldn 't get within five miles , about eight kilometers , of an actual movie . BOY does this thing suck . There isn 't one original line , thought , shot , or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close . The magical , ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - boring . Steve Railsback - boring . John Vernon - boring . The big bug - boring . If this is a scary movie , Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary . Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness . Usually it 's in the opening credits - " " Written , Directed , and Produced by " " one guy . Or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there 's one and only one reason this turkey got made . Here , you don 't find out till the very last of the credits , where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the Canadian Government is gratefully acknowledged .

" I was supremely disappointed with this one . Having just read the wonderful Oscar Wilde story , I had hoped for at least a little of the magic to translate onto the screen . Well , there was none . This version played like a condensed , dumbed down Reader 's Digest movie . Not only did it feel rushed , it was cheapened and needlessly re written . Major characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed . I appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen , especially on what may very well have been a limited ( TV ) budget , but there is no excuse for mangling a great story in this way . I thoroughly recommend reading Wilde 's tale of the depravity that exists under even the most beautiful exteriors . But I cannot advise anyone to rent this travesty . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My husband and I went to see this movie , being the horror movie buffs that we are . Two hours later I found myself wanting both my money and time back . I was so disappointed . The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film . There was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances , etc . I found most of the ' scary ' parts to be more comical than anything . After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers , I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening here in the US . My advice : If you are a fan of true horror movies , save yourself the pain of sitting through this one . I can 't really say that I would recommend renting it either , unless you have a free rental coming to you . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
I guess they reward idiocy today because whoever came up with the concept for this movie was not shot on sight.This is a morons delight .

Lets pray for a remake where the whole school gets nuked . * * * Spoiler * * * how does a school so run down have the internet in the first place ? , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie made me think .... of how I could write something about it without personally dissing the director and all the actors , who , as an Australian , I am proud of for actually getting out there and making a film.But the movie itself ? Let me tell you a story .... Found this DVD in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague recollections of the reviews at the time of cinema release here , so I thought I would give it a go.For some reason , I decided to watch the ' special features ' before I watched the actual movie , not something that I usually do . Turned the ' making of ' off halfway through , as I 'd had enough cringing at the ' aren 't we so wonderful for putting together such a hard hitting film with such a raw script ' attitude.The movie ? Ugh . Full of clich챕s and pathetic character development . The actors ? Well done guys , you are Aussies and I applaud you . And , just like a footy team is only as good as the coach that directs them , you unfortunately did NOT have a great script to work with.I felt that the movie actually trivialised so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover . I have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap . Agreed.Finally ( and forgive me if I don 't phrase this correctly ) , I was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all . Yes , we all know that life is full of hard stuff , and yes we know that things such as incest DO occur , but I really find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it . I believe that a director has a responsibility to put it in there SOMEWHERE . Otherwise , the movie is all about THEM and THEIR feelings , they have created it for themselves , not for an audience.Which I think is the basis of why this movie isn 't so great . The special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36 hour sitting , the day after he himself tried to end his own life . Well , it may have been cathartic for him to do this , however the movie reeks of self-indulgence when you know the story behind why it was written . " " I feel horrid , I 'm going to write a movie about feeling horrid " . " ( Note : I have read the interview with Andrew Urban , and understand WHY Thalluri needed to write something to help him through his own issues , but I believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed - the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs , and I feel that this is what has unintentionally happened here ) By his own admission , the director had no technical experience at all , and sadly , this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media project.As for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school , or that all teenagers should watch it - not sure there either . Because there is a VERY dangerous line at the end . I too have been in a place where I have thought that someone who no longer has to ' face life ' is ' lucky ' , but as an adult , I do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind . Might be in there to promote discussion , but again , it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole . In fact , it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come.I haven 't seen Elephant , but I just might go find it , given all the comparisons here.Nothing personal here guys , I do hope you can make another movie someday , and we all have to start out somewhere , so forgive me if I 've been too harsh . I am glad that you are proud of what you created , which in the end is what life is all about . It 's not a movie I would recommend though.Oh , I DID like the way the time-frames often collided , thought that was an interesting way to film . But the whole " " Its the quiet ones you have to watch " " - we already know that . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Visually stunning ? Most definitely . I have seen few films look this good in some time . Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow uses striking cinematography , computer graphics , and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh . The time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s . The movie tells of recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason . Also , mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide . Who can stop them and save the world ? Alright , it doesn 't take a leap of faith to know it is the Sky Captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead , and in the wings his trusty , thoroughly competent sidekick . What Sky Captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization . The plot for this film is ridiculous . That being said , the film is going for a serial-like feeling of film serials of yesteryear . They had pretty far out stories and bad acting - but none of them , and I mean none of them , had the budget and big names this film had . Two academy award winning performers and Jude Law could keep a film afloat , one would think , but Sky Captain sinks miserably . Despite its fantastic dark look , I found myself wishing the film would just end and I could get on with my life . I had little interest in a story that generated little interest . I didn 't care at all for any of the glib portrayals . Paltrow was just awful . Jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance . Law cannot carry the one-liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders . I mean , let 's face it , he 's not Will Smith , Mel Gibson , or even Wesley Snipes . The sad thing about Sky Captain , at least for me , was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little . I was bored ten minutes into the film - waiting for something to hook my interest - and it never came . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie , but few minutes after it started , I wanted to leave the theater . For a while I hoped at least the story will surprise me , but then realized it 's a waste of time , there was just nothing there . I stayed only because I had another show after it.Design : some designs where quite beautiful , mostly of the environment , but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design . They look great while still - on posters and screenshots , but not when they have to come to life ! They just didn 't work , mostly because the very same mistake most 3D companies make : technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in 3D , that would make you feel that the character is alive . You need a lot of effort and knowledge ( hence money ) to create something that really feels like hair , skin , fabric , etc . Those characters in the movie were made out of " " cloth " , " and that just didn 't work ! So they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality , where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic . It just didn 't have the feel of a material , that dolls are made of ( that 's what those characters meant to be ) . I think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters . It just had a feeling of a 3D shoot 'n'run computer game . I don 't want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen , don 't know about you ... Animation was also a disgrace . I am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in " " 9 " . " It was stiff , boring , almost lacked any imagination or mood . It was just a little bit above most average 3D animations I saw , and that doesn 't add to it any good ... And all that - the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story , right ? ! That was not the case here . Actually the story was the worst thing in that movie . It was below any level . It starts straight forward , it goes straight forward and it ends the same . There is no twist , no surprise , no good dialogs , even no development . We 've heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and " " 9 " " is just one of them , and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie . The characters don 't even have time to get into the story - they are just there , showing themselves almost immediately , and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know what 's going on . It just didn 't work . There are also many repetitive action sequences , that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a story ... Acting , sound and script - oh my gosh , what can I tell , it was pathetic . Bad story has a bad script , and except dialogs like " " No , don 't do it ! " " " " I will do it ! " " " " But ... you cannot do it alone ! " " " " We can do it together ! " " " " But there are rules ! " " " " But we have to save him ! " " etc etc and so on , and repeating itself all the time , so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs , there were those non stop " " Ahh " " and " " Ohhh " " and " " Ehh " , " and " " Oooh " , " and " " Whatchout " , " and " " Run ! " " and " " OhOhh ! " " that were following almost every jump , run , or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsed.Conclusion : bad acting , bad animation , bad sound , bad story , bad script , bad characters , everything expected , no surprises , no twist , nothing . Only some good designs are not worth the time . BIG NO ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Don 't bother to check for logic . There is none . But on the other hand , there are MANY really great movies that totally lack logic , so why bother ? I both like and dislike this film . I like it because the action sequences in the air are really great , you get to see a lot of dogfighting . I also like the F-16 , which is a very cool plane.But there are just too many goofs to make me really enjoy it . I guess it 's not fair to wish for SOME sort of continuity , as it is hard to make a really good fighter film - but I also think there should be some sense of reason.And I have a question : do they fly from California to the Middle East in F-16s without air refueling ? I 'd like to see that happening . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Someone else called this film a " " fable-horror " " movie , and I think that fits pretty well . That 's the concept at least . A group of teenagers , each with their own vice , catch the eye of a twisted sideshow barker . He decides to teach the teens a lesson by making them part of the freak show . A cool idea , but could have been executed better . The fate for some of the teens is shoved in your face too obviously , while other characters could have been fleshed out more . Also , the ending was a serious let down . No resolution or big twist or anything . But as a low budget horror movie , it 's pretty fun to watch . If you 're into cheesy spookfests , you should have a laugh watching this one . I think one of it 's faults though ... that it takes itself too seriously . It 's a silly movie , and if it was a little more self-aware when it comes to that , I think it would have been better . But at least there 's enough neat carnival themes and b-movie monster makeup to keep you watching . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

After about 35 minutes , we both got up and left . Everything we 'd read said how great this was . The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert actually called it " " intelligent " " and said it wasn 't a crude sex comedy . Did he go to the right movie ?

" Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles . Even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise , you 'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog , nonsensical plot contrivances , and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen.I have a theory : every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his / her career . This was Tommy Lee Jones 's turn . Although he makes a decent effort , the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames ( oops , sorry about that ) . Most of the supporting cast is also choked by the hackneyed writing ; a few of the actors simply phone in their roles . Anne Heche deserves special Hall of Shame recognition for her awkward portrayal of a scientist . She is about as convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman , and even he would have at least done a better acting job.Since the scientific plot holes are too numerous to list here , I would instead suggest that you screen the film with friends , and have a game of " " Find the scientific absurdities . " " The loser could be forced to listen to tapes of corny lines from the movie like " " Everybody looks the same " " over and over . Here 's a sample of the kind of nonsense you can expect : a scheme to blow up a building is devised , engineered , and the dynamite set and detonated all within a space of about 20 minutes . Let us not forget the obligatory disaster movie clich챕s : divorced dads , scientists who get ignored by everybody , obnoxious cops , tough street kids , bratty teenagers , greedy investors etc . ; all are present and in abundance . The film also bashes you over the head with a relentless barrage of political correctness.For fans of cheese and silliness only . All other viewers : beware . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times . He may have made more classics than anyone else . He may have been a perfectionist . But man , was his first attempt ever bad ! Kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map : it looks like an Ed Wood film . It has strange narration , cheap shots , bad dialogue , ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi / horror flick , and what looks like relatives of the cast of " " Reefer Madness " " going insane for no reason.Sure , you can see an undeveloped Kubrick in there . It is a psychological / horror study of war . The characters became dehumanized and insane . There are people playing more than one role . There are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people . And there are a few interesting shots around there .

" Woof ! Pretty boring , and they might as well have shot it in black and white , it was so colorless.The movie starts with rolling text explaining cryogenics , and asking whether god or Satan is behind it . There are some protests outside a cryogenics lab . Some people rob a bank , and many of the robbers and guards get shot . The father of one of the robbers ( I think ) arranges to have his son frozen . There 's a lot of jumping around in the beginning from scene to scene introducing characters without us knowing how they relate.There 's a power outage , and the cannisters containing the frozen people get struck by lightning , and they emerge as zombies . They 're all wearing silver mylar-like suits , and their skin is dark green and wrinkled ( no idea why they look so bad - being frozen evidently didn 't preserve their looks ) , and they have silver eyes . They go around killing people , sometimes lurching like zombies , sometimes moving like normal people.Linda Blair keeps showing up every once in a while , to what purpose I 'm not really sure . I think her character works at the cryogenics lab , but she 's not very important to the plot , and her role is very small.The movie ends with some freeze frames with text captions that tell us what happened to the characters next , which are pretty silly . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Isn 't anyone else tired of that old clich챕 ' where a nearly dead person shows up in a horror film , gives us some informations , and then blasts his head off for no apparent reason ? I know I am.The sad thing is that it 's use in this film is worthless . If you have seen the first film ( the first remake I should say ) then the information given is completely worthless , because you would have already known it . I guess , you can that it isn 't worthless to the main characters .. but then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head ? Wouldn 't he want to live ? Sure , he would have died anyway .. This is the second film to be titled " " The Hills Have Eyes II . " " The first being the sequel to the original 70 's film . This is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me . See , I 'm probably part of minority of people my age that even knew there was a HHE2 to begin with , much less an original HHE1 . And now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original HHE1 ... it just makes it worse ! But anyways .. Wes Craven 's original Hills Have Eyes was decent . In the end , though , the idea was better than the presentation , but he most likely had a low budget . To be quite honest , Wes Craven isn 't that good of a horror director . He 's only made a few good horror movies ( Nightmare on Elm St. , New Nightmare ) , a few alright ones ( Scream ) and a bunch of horrible ones ( Cursed , Shocker , Vampire in Brooklyn ) . Oh yeah , and he made Swamp Thing , as well ... but the original HHE2 falls under the latter category . I 've only seen a few minutes , but it was terrible.Now he has co-written the new HHE2 .. and it 's such a disappointment ! Last year 's HHE remake was even better than the original film . It was tense . I guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family , and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenagers . It made us feel dirty . For the first hour , we were in hell , and finally in the last few moments , the good guys got revenge on the bad guys and it felt good .. This new film has no tension . No suspense whatsoever . Just violent things happening to mostly stupid people . There is hardly any menacing presence here . Just ugly hobos hiding under rocks.I 'm getting tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they keep making . It was just the other day that I watching " " Deep Blue Sea " " where Samuel L. Jackson kept on walking around the water , while giving the speech , and then he gets eaten by a shark , only because the idiot stayed to close to the water .. something that nobody would do in the given situation ! Here is the exact same thing . People go off by themselves to take a leak even though they know people are dying .. seriously , couldn 't a potty break wait ? And then when you think people would have learned , someone else goes of by themselves ! Seriously , isn 't more scary when the characters are bringing their A-game and still losing ? I would think so ... It even under delivers . It should have made the first remake look like " " The Fog " " remake ( which was less menacing than an episode of " " Becker " " ) . More bad guys . More time in the caves . More tension . More of everything.But it actually downgrades . Less bad guys . No tension . Sure we have more time in the caves , but not a whole lot happens there . In the end , it only seems like there is two or three bad guys . The last film made it seem like a whole tribe of people . Where is this tribe ? Who keeps on watching them through binoculars ? Seriously , these are the things this film should have brought us , but it ends with the exact same promise that the last film gave us , with that exact same " " being watched " " scene . Come on ! I 'll give the devil it 's due . The look of the film is good .. but thats it.I don 't even think fans of gore will like this .. though I 'm probably wrong ! There is gore ( though most of it is sped-up while in the dark ) , but without the tension , and characters you even care about .. the gore does nothing in my book !

It has Bruce Lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it doesn 't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air . It just gets downright absurd from then , like something out of a cheap comic book . Maybe the idea isn 't so rotten but it isn 't done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view . There are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there , usually all made in Hong Kong . I think that Jean Claude van Dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera . Even Steven Seagal 's films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong . ' Game of Death II ' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion , despite Bruce Lee being in it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" he was my hero for all time until he went along with { if you can call it a movie } I went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero 's acting and the hole thing was ............. I can 't believe that Steven Segal 's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors . I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong.The plot is unbelievable as a movie , and even if you excuse the visuals , and had read this story as a novel , you 'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book.Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . He shows no effort and no enthusiasm , and in some scenes he doesn 't show up at all.I hate to repeat other peoples comments , but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . The condition of those scenes chopped in , is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie , it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget ( Segal being paid 5 of that ) and that the movie still came in under budget . I must concur.It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie , as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Words cannot describe how horrible this movie is . Well , maybe they can . I 'll take a stab at it : 1 - Pitiful . Hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics . Apparently script and storyline aren 't needed anymore.2 - Violent . Kids movie but yet one of the characters is viciously attacked and killed.3 - Blatantly stupid . The movie is actually depicting the farm animals as having human abilities . In Nemo , the fish could talk , but for the most part , they are still fish . We only hear the English as a translation . In Barnyard , the animals are actually speaking English that other people can understand.4 - Unintelligent - No smart story line or even any smart humor . ( Ok , the 13 year old dog on crutches was funny ) .5 - Culturally insensitive - The " " black " " cow is actually played by a black actress . The pink cow is played by a white actress . The black cow was playing a stereotypical black person.6 - Ignorant - No such thing as a male cow that I 'm aware of . I believe we call them bulls ? If we are going to expose our children to drek , it might as well have the simplest facts correct.7 - Boring and Borish . My 4 year old had us leave after 45 minutes . He practically fell asleep.I 'm sure this movie will make millions , which is unfortunate , because it only proves to Hollywood producers that the American public at large is just filled with suckers waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two . An unfortunate circumstance . Why should the producers spend real money when the returns will be the same either way . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Dungeon of Harrow " " had a lot of things that could 've made this quite a good horror film . Creepy mansion , a torture chamber , a paranoid host , a henchman , a ghoul in the dungeon , etc . But sadly to say this wasn 't made very well.A writer and a skipper get shipwrecked on an island owned by a count in a castle , his slave , and a mute maid . The count becomes more and more suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates ( of all things ) and gets more inclined to turn on them and subject them , and the mute maid who befriends them , to torture and imprisonment . Sound not-bad right ? Well , not quite . I used to call this one of the worst movies I have ever seen , but now I hesitate . Because it had so much potential it can 't really be called " " one of the worst . " " However , seeing all this potential go to waste is a really big hit against this film . All in all , it 's not a very good movie.There is a very Gothic-suspense scene when our hero is chained in the dungeon and is confronted by the insane and leprous rotting bride , adorned in a tattered wedding dress . This was both creepy and disturbing the first time I saw the horror unfold in this scene . Man I wish this was a better movie ! This movie had all the right stuff to make this a moody late-night chiller , but ultimately took all the wrong turns . I suggest someone remake this one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film.The story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the " " gray " " characters turn " " good " " and the " " bad " " guys get their just desserts and * boom * ... it 's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up.Which wouldn 't have been so bad ... if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place . But such is not the case and the movie soon becomes a goofy mess.My advice is to watch this movie up to about the last 30 minutes ... and then shut it off . At this point , imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look based on what you have seen so far.Believe me , the ending you come up with will look far better than how this film actually ends .

" Demer Daves , is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and " " broken arrow " " remains in everybody 's mind.As far as melodrama is concerned , he should leave that to knowing people like Vincente Minelli , George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk . The screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepie.Natalie Wood ' s character was inspired by Fannie Hurst 's " " imitation of life " " ( see Stahl and Sirk ) , but who could believe she 's a black man 's daughter anyway ? Susan Kohner was more credible in " " imitation of life " " ) and Sinatra and Curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with them : the poor officer , and the wealthy good-looking -and mean- sergeant.Guess whom will Natalie fall in love with ? France is shown as a land of tolerance , where interracial unions are warmly welcome.At the time ( circa 1944 ) it was dubious , it still is for narrow-minded people you can find here there and everywhere . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Lone Star Productions sure churned them out in the 1930 's , and " " Star Packer " " has the feel of one of the more rushed ones . John Wayne is U.S. Marshal John Travers , investigating a crooked hoodlum known only as " " The Shadow " , " responsible for stealing cattle , stage holdups and the like , and giving orders from behind the door of a phony wall safe . Yakima Canutt is Travers ' trusty Indian sidekick , appropriately named as ... well , " " Yak " . " Early on , we find out that Cattlemens Union head Matt Matlock ( George pre-Gabby Hayes ) is really The Shadow ; the dead giveaway is when he offers to buy out his ( supposed ) niece Anita 's half of the Matlock Ranch , since " " this is no place for a girl " . " As Anita , Verna Hillie doesn 't have much to do in the film , although in a comic moment , she gets to use a six shooter to blast the butt of one of the villains in a night time scare raid.There are a few curiosities in the film - for one , Wayne 's character alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film . In what could have been a neat device , a hollowed out tree stump used by a henchman is located right in the middle of the street . And finally , the movie doesn 't truly live up to it 's name , as Sheriff Travers never wears a badge throughout the film , that is , a star packer without a star.The horse chases , the runaway stage scenes , the stagecoach off the cliff ( another curiosity , the horses conveniently get loose from the stage ) are all pretty standard stuff . But John Wayne fans will want to see this one for the charisma he displayed early on in his career . For those more critical , the white kerchiefs worn around the forehead by the good guy posse could only mean that they all had a headache . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Interferencia starts as unemployed Martin Sanders ( Andres Bagg ) hears something strange on his phone , he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named Diana & arranging to meet her . Soon after Martin reads a local paper & sees the front page story about a prostitute being murdered & thinks back to what he heard . Martin confides in his friends Laura ( Virginia Lustig ) & Aaron ( Oliver Kolker ) but they don 't believe him . Then shortly after the same thing happens again , the phone call , the man , the prostitute & her death reported in the papers . Martin decides he has to find the killer & put a stop to his killing spree but who is it ? This Argentinian production that was apparently shot in just eight days ( why so long ? ) on a budget of about $ 3,000 ( why so much ? ) was written & directed by Sergio Esquenazi & I cannot believe some of the glowing comments Interferencia has on the IMDb . Out of 195 user ratings as I write this 113 of them rate this pile of crap 10 out of 10 , I am sorry but there is no way anyone should be giving a film this bad a quite literally perfect score of 10 out of 10 . If a score for a film on IMDb is fixed then this is it , I honestly don 't believe that if you showed Interferencia to 195 average people that well over 100 of them would rate it as being absolutely perfect , no way on Earth . The user comments are also amazingly positive , all by IMDb users who have only wrote comments for one film , this . The one user ( besides me ) who has actually written more than one comment gave it a rock bottom 1 out of 10 which sounds just about right . Everyone is entitled to an opinion but I would stake my life on the fact most of those positive comments are from fake accounts set up purely to big this piece of crap up . Where do I start ? How on Earth can I adequately describe how bad Interferencia is ? The plot is a mess that basically lives or dies by it 's terrible twists , while most twists turn a plot on it 's head & alters the perspective of everything that has gone before in a clever & relevant way & are genuine surprises here in Interferencia the twists destroy the first half of the film & makes it utterly pointless in a ' it didn 't actually happen ' sort of way & the twist is so poorly handled that it leaves you asking more questions than it answers . What made Martin go mad ? Why did he imagine the phone calls ? Why did he imagine a killer ? Why did he imagine the newspaper headlines ? No explanation is given for Martin 's behaviour during the first hour or so of the film , there 's just this absurd revelation that it was all in his mind & that 's it , that 's all the exposition there is . Then there 's a plot twist about Martin 's missing wife & her lover before Martin for reasons unexplained starts to kill his friends for no apparent reason . I am sorry but Interferencia is so bad , it 's so boring , it 's so badly written & thought out that I honestly can 't think of a positive thing to say about it . Sorry guy 's but that 's how I feel , quite simply Interferencia is one of the worst films I have ever seen & is a complete mess both conceptually & technically.According to the IMDb Interferencia was hot in just eight days , to be honest it doesn 't feel like that at all . Nope , it feels more like it was shot in five days ! The whole film is an eyesore , Interferencia has probably the worst nighttime shooting I have ever seen . It 's like no attempt was made to light the scenes , it 's like the makers just went into a dark room or basement or whatever & just shoot the scene regardless of whether you could see anything . The scenes set outside in the daytime have this horrible unnatural blue green tint to them for no apparent reason which just looks daft & becomes increasingly irritating . This strange tint is not repeated on indoor scenes so they are also quite jarring & noticeable . There 's no real horror or scares , in fact I would say Interferencia is more of a thriller than a horror . As far as gore goes there are two decapitated heads in a fridge , a knife is stuck in someones mouth & nothing else.According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $ 3,000 which makes Interferencia one of the lowest budgeted films ever commercially released surely ? Some people think just because a film is low budget all reasonable viewing standards should go out of the window & we should accept any old crap , wrong ! To watch this on DVD you will still have to pay good money & I personally think we have the right to expect some sort of good product . If this can get released & praised like it 's Oscar worthy then we can all release our holiday camcorder footage ( including embarrassing karaoke footage & scenes of total blackness as we forgot to take off the lens cap ) & win top prizes at the next Cannes film festival ! The acting is awful although the female lead Virginia Lustig is actually rather sexy & helps ease the pain of the final twenty odd minutes as she features a fair bit.Interferencia is an absolutely terrible film , seriously I beg you don 't be fooled by all the fake positive comments , there is no way anyone not involved in this or have some sort of agenda is going to give it a 9 or 10 out of 10 . An amateurish mess that is truly horrible to sit through . Sorry but that 's the way I see it , sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind ... you have been warned ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I can barely find the words to describe how much this piece of trash offended me . Why is it that American filmmakers always go out of there way to portray Jamaicans as a bunch of backwards ass bush babies and worse yet , cast people to play Jamaicans who sound utterly ridiculous when they try to imitate the accent ? We are not all extremely dark , we do not all walk around carrying machetes whether for work OR PROTECTION , we do not walk around naked in our homes and we do not practice VOODOO ! ! We are doctors , lawyers , architects , Businessmen and women , musicians , actors AND FILMMAKERS . I am sick and tired of watching all of these portrayals of Jamaicans as a bunch of dreadlock wearing Rastafarians who do nothing but sit around all day smoking weed on a beach or shooting guns in the air ( When we 're not living in our tree houses ) . YES , we wear clothes . YES , we have electricity . No , weed is not legal on the island AND CHANCES ARE WE SPEAK BETTER English THAN YOU ! The worst part is , this isn 't just me being angry and bitter , these are actual answers to questions that most Jamaicans who have traveled overseas have been asked at some point . Read a book before you assume what 's it 's like in another country and worse yet , decide to make a movie about it.WELCOME TO JAMAICA !

What a disappointment ! I hated the mummy but this one was even worse ! It was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point I found myself sighing and yawning all the time . I can 't believe that people actually liked this movie . The role of Nicholas Cage wasn 't very convincing . The whole movie felt like a grand tour around America 's most wanted buildings . The never stopping flow of hints and combinations wasn 't very convincing either . I stopped paying attention around 30 minutes . What was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment . What a drag ... I guess I 've just seen too many movies to enjoy National Treasure . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Gods ... where to start . I was only able to stomach about the first 10 minutes before I turned it off in disgust . Aside from the actor playing Robin Hood himself , the rest were just terrible . And , I can only stretch my suspension of disbelief only so far.From the very opening of the first episode , I lost count of how many errors , plot holes , and horrible costumes there were . It began with some poor peasant trying to hunt for a deer to feed his family . All well and good . However , the poor blighter must have been mostly deaf , because a handful of soldiers , in full armour , on horseback , were able to sneak up on him to within about 10 feet.Then , as he 's running away , he goes from having them 10 feet behind him , to a shot where you cannot even see them at all , immediately followed by them about 20 feet behind him again . Then , he runs into some bushes , and is immediately manhandled by two of the soldiers ... who just mere seconds before , were galloping on horseback , dozens of feet behind him.The " " armour " " on the soldiers is so painfully obviously cloth which they tried to make look like maille , and miserably failed . Not to mention , the lead soldier 's " " armour " " being about 5 sizes too big for the poor fellow . Seriously , he looks like he is a small child wearing his father 's over-sized armour ! Finally , Robin manages to fire about 5 , perfectly aimed shots all around one soldier 's hand , in the span of about 2 seconds , from what appears to be a recurve bow . No human alive could make those kinds of shots , in that short amount of time , with a scoped rifle , much less a bow.After that , they escape the soldiers and stop to help an amazingly well dressed and clean " " peasant " " with digging a ditch ... something that all noblemen were willing to do all the time , right ? How this sorry excuse for a series ever got a second season is beyond me . The production costs ( at least for what I saw ) must have soared in the dozens of dollars ( or Euros ) ... Seriously - I think a highschool drama class could have put on a better rendition . This was so bad , even that terrible Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood was better.I highly suggest you skip this monstrosity , and go rent or buy the mid-80 's " " Robin of Sherwood " " series . Much better written , acted , costumed , and produced.For shame , BBC ... for shame ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
I had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on Broadway with Kathy Bates in the lead . I only saw one other play in the 1970 's-1990 's that had an emotional impact like this play did . I really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when I learned that Kathy Bates wouldn 't reprise her role in the film--she wasn 't well known off Broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power I suppose and cast Sissy Spacek instead . Sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to Kathy Bates in any way . I love Anne Bancroft but she seemed too young for this role . The movie plot was true to the play . Anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have to admit that Over Her Dead Body actually wasn 't as bad as I was expecting , my mom wanted to see it , so I rented it . I figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes , but actually this wasn 't too bad . I was just expecting this horrific movie , but it seems like the writers meant no harm , but the casting of Eva Longoria ( Parker , sorry ) , she seems a little off set for the movie . I think I may have found it to be a little better without her , just she does annoy me . But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable . But you have to admit , there was no point to this movie , it was one of those quick paychecks for the actor type of thing . The movie could 've been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast.Henry just lost his bride to be , Kate , who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day . But when his sister takes him to a psychic , Ashley , Henry falls for her , but Kate is haunting her from beyond the grave . Kate is jealous and doesn 't want Henry to move on so quickly and she will make sure that Ashley doesn 't get him by torturing her day and night with her rambles , believe me , with Kate 's voice , that 's scary.Over Her Dead Body is an alright movie , not sure if it 's worth the money , but I 'd give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious . Eva Longoria just doesn 't have enough star power to make the film work , no offense to those who love her , she just belongs on the small screen over the silver screen . Not to mention the character of Ashley , she seems still not too likable with everything she pulls , or her " " gay " " friend , Dan , just again , not really likable . Just with some re-writing and proper attention , this film could have been better , but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with with an empty feeling.4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ignoring ( if possible ) the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking ( which seems to be mandatory in Australian government-funded films ) the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance . That 's a far as it goes . The rest is simply awful . The plot 's overburdened with " " wow " " symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere . A gross example is the giant peach float , obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory . It was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free , but nevertheless irrelevant , prop ! The peach is given a cursory , unexplained wash-down at one stage but that 's where it ends.Similarly , the contrived " " black spot " " road sign where Steph 's parents were killed , is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past , but her escape to what ? She 's had a pretty good deal where she was , especially considering her visual disability and the unending , loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian.The Guinness ' prize for corny melodrama , however , goes to the characterization of Alan . Alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but " " rats " " on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi-national - hiss ! hiss ! As a supervisor , Alan performs the boss ' villainous dirty work . He implements redundancies until , surprise , surprise , the whole plant is closed and Alan himself is left as a pathetic , unemployed failure . No clich챕-free zones here , mate ! Not only this , but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you 'd encounter . If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic , don 't ask about detail . What 's the significance of the shaving cream on Steph 's seductive leg ? Why doesn 't the hotel , where the couple makes love , eventually twig that someone 's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and , among other pandemoniums , the sheets are regularly soiled - quite spectacularly on one occasion .

At least his son made a decent soundtrack.You have to look at this from the standpoint that it didn 't seem like a movie . It looked as if someone else directed it for one thing . I won 't believe Carpenter put any effort into this at all.I was just listening to his old school H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack and it was awesome , especially for the times.He was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Wind . Easily one of the worst films ever made . The only good that comes from this kind of pointless drivel , is the fact that seeing films like this get distribution makes indy horror filmmakers like me confident that my upcoming feature will make the cut too . I mean , if this represents the market for indy horror , I could make a fortune videotaping myself taking out the garbage for 83 minutes . A complete list of what this film lacks would take way too long to write out . But , the highlites are : no story , terrible acting , awful cinematography , and virtually no editing . That last one bothered me the most . As an editor myself , this film drove me absolutely crazy because it had almost no editing at all . Every scene was shot in a master . They had absolutely no coverage at all . For anyone who doesn 't know ... " " coverage " " is shooting a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options when editing to make for a desirable viewing experience . Yeah , this movie had none of that . I 'm talking about even the simplest of scenes . Example : an ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table would typically start out with a master establishing who 's in the scene and where they are . Then , as the conversation goes on , you would cut back and forth to over-the-shoulder shots as the conversation continues . You may even throw in a cutaway shot or two of something on the table , or in someone 's hand . Anything . This is " " Film 101 " " stuff guys . It seems as though these people had no idea this is how films work . Every shot was a camera lock-down . No movement , no cutting , no nothing . If I was teaching a course in filmmaking , this would be the visual aid for my " " What not to do " " lesson.In closing , don 't waste your time folks . The only amazing this about this film is that it ever scored distribution at all . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I read the other comments here about this movie before watching it . If you 've read them , you will know that they are almost all negative . I really don 't understand that . I admit that it is far too long ( it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit ) . The music is often inappropriate . But , strong performances by Ford and Thomas are indeed enough to carry this . With all his fame as a movie star , I 'd forgotten that Harrison Ford really can act ! This role as a man who has defined himself based upon a lie is remarkable . I find it completely believable that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was deception . Thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception . Her initial denial which leads to confusion and then to inner calm is tremendous . This movie is never going to be on anybody 's list of great flicks , but it isn 't that bad . I 'm glad that I waited to see it on video , but it is worth the $ 3 or $ 4 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" You know all those letters to " " Father Christmas " " and " " Jesus " " that are sent every year ? Well , it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half-forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them . As bizarre settings go , it 's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is " " Dead Letter Office " . " Having said that , this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one . If it was Royal Mail , most letters get this sort of treatment anyway . I haven 't been in this flat for two years and we 're still getting letters for a Mr Wang , some female priest of the Church of Latter Day I 've-Never-Heard-Of-You and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company . " " Dead Letter Office " " ( the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up ) follows the story of Alice ( Miranda Otto ) who grows up in a seriously divided home . Writing to her absent father , she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven 't been delivered for one reason or another . So , logically , she gets a job at the D.L.O. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding Chilean immigrant Frank Lopez ( George Del Hoyo ) . Slowly , she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self-contained world of the Dead Letters Office to its knees ? Nothing against this film but I was reminded of the god-awful Heather Graham film " " Committed " " while watching this . However , this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again , that ain 't difficult . For a start , this film is much more logical . True , the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood . But at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel . It is also well acted . Both Otto and Del Hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they 'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best . Part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly , leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed . The other part is that when you consider Australia 's draconian immigration policy ( i.e. if you don 't speak English , rack off ! ) , such a story is unlikely to take place in reality . The other characters , sadly , also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd-ball stereotypes.Despite that , " " Dead Letter Office " " is certainly something a little different . It might not be to everyone 's taste but I liked it . Yes , it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes , it 's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy-duty swearing and nudity ( no chance of that in an Australian film ) . There ain 't any major laughs , there 's no Bullet Time and the characters are usually one-dimensional . But it 's the story that counts here and while it 's not earth-shattering in its magnificence , it 's a pleasant enough way of passing the time . It 's the movie equivalent of a Sheryl Crow CD - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn 't really miss it if it wasn 't there . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Anyone familiar with my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be a grumpy bastard from time to time . There are a lot of films I don 't like which , for some unfathomable reason , I 've felt the urge to review . However , if anyone out there is curious to know the name of the worst film I 've ever seen , look no further than Transylvania 6-5000 . Without question , this takes the title of the all-time no . 1 awful film . I can 't believe that I actually made it from the start of this clunker to the finish ! It is clearly meant to capture the flavour of Mel Brooks 's Young Frankenstein , but where that film was a funny take on horror movie traditions , this one is a desperately strained and misguided attempt to wring laughs from embarrassingly weak material . Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr look ashamed to be here as a pair of journalists in modern day Transylvania ( perhaps they realised early on that they were doomed in this dud ) . During their research , they come up against all the chief monsters from past horror favourites , such as vampires , werewolves and mummies.Anyone who manages to brave this film right through to its end may pray that a stake be driven through their heart to relieve them from the agony of boredom . It marks a career nadir for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way , it results in awesomely dire entertainment . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" For several reasons , this movie is simply awful . Other posters have listed some of this movie 's historical errors . Well , I have a layman 's knowledge of Roman history and even I found the inaccuracies flagrant . I usually forgive errors in historical movies because I understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate . And shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some , let 's say , historical license . But this movie goes well beyond mere rounding.There 's worse . To tell a story from a distant period , the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing . Unless viewers have some prior knowledge of the period , they will quickly be lost . In addition , the movie was obviously filmed simultaneously in Italian and English with various actors being dubbed later . At times , the actors seem as if they were in completely different movies which were then edited together . In fact , this is not far wrong . The actors were obviously pasted onto a cheesy computer generated ancient Rome.The only reason I give this boring mess any stars is because I always find Peter O 'Toole entertaining . But that is no reason to rent it . If you are curious about Roman history , there are much better movies available . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi flick . For one thing , it was directed by Tim Burton . Another thing , it 's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic . I found it boring , gross , and ridiculous . If you 've seen it , you know what I mean . Just about everyone at Imdb say it 's crap and boy , are they right ! If you haven 't , avoid it .

" When something can be anything you want it to be or mean , it 's bound to register with someone as being rather special . But just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship , and to another of his aunt 's rear , and yet to another absolutely nothing other than a cloud , this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the viewers ' interpretation . Anyone who might find throwing a stuffed giraffe out of a window brilliant , or worthwhile for that matter , without relating it in some context , is possibly merely trying to impress us with his or her intellectuality.Submitting to this movie as the dreams of a madman does quite nicely , especially since there is no standard or expectation for what said dreams would be like , and even if we were mad ourselves , this would hardly give us sane reference points for comparison . A love affair with this movie entails the same risk as seriously interpreting Nostradamus . Whatever real meaning was being conveyed at the time might be buried in the private jokes , musings , or provincial minutiae of its day , and to a select few radical intellectuals at that ! I did spot a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity though.The movie is definitely anti-Fascist and to some extent anti-Italian . I noted that although the years 1929-30 were years of great public works and urban renewal in Italy , any indication of this seemed avoided . Furthermore , ( avant-guarde academic spinners take note of this for your next class ) the very short cropped haired man with the mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of Victor Emmanuel III and his tall female companion none other than Queen Helen , formerly Princess of Montenegro . Without an understanding of potential historical relevance , even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academic or other intellectual poseurs who would bask in irrelevance to impress us.I gladly add my own paint buckets to the defacement of this cinematic joke . But in an adaptation of the famous mot by the little boy ; The movie really has no face ( to deface ) . Paint would help it burn though . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Paranormal State " " is an interesting show for most paranormal believers .

They go to real haunted locations and I suspect that they speak with actual witnesses .

" Cybrog 2 : Glass Shadow stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks ( Rhymes with kicks ! ) a karate instructor who helps a Cash ( Jolie ) escape from Pinwheel , her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company . Along the way Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd show up to displace the duo , while Jack Palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run . One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise , is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast . The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon ( Don 't know her ? Well she was in a bunch of 70 's pornos ) this one has Jack Palance , Elias Koteas , Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie . The third one has William Katt , Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell . ( Okay so , Cyborg 3 's cast isn 't that impressive . ) I 've never seen Cyborg 3 , but I did see this on Sci-Fi channel and must admit I wasn 't impressed . Actually strike that , Cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie , it 's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye . However Cyborg 1 was the same way , indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style , slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye . Unfortunately like the first , this one doesn 't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture . Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom , so for various reasons the movie doesn 't have much to offer beyond it 's look . Another aspect is the terrible acting . Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie isn 't much better . Elias Koteas and Jack Palance come off fine but seriously Palance is playing a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor . I guess on the positive side you can 't accuse Michael Schroeder of not being ambitious with casting . Still the movie is dull and I for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in . Also why did they tie it in with Cyborg anyway ? It has nothing to do with it 's predecessor , which this manages to be worse than . * out of 4- ( Bad ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Eric Roberts " " stars " " in this Tommy Lee Thomas debut prison film . He plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards . Though evil by most people 's standards , his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with " " Lethal Weapon " " electric prods.The movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense . Thomas has Clint Eastwood 's squinter eyes , Dolph Lundgren 's one-liners , the acting abilities of JCVD and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation.Martin " " Cobra Kai " " Kove 's career shares this low point with Roberts , in the film it is difficult to tell if Kove 's character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if Kove just came that way . I couldn 't blame him if he did.Fortunately for all involved , this movie has a " " so bad that it 's good " " quality that can be fun IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETTER TO DO . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Fame did something odd . It was not only a musical that was created originally for the screen ( most are based off of Broadway musicals ) , but it spawned a TV series and a Broadway musical . Let me correct that sentence . Fame is not a musical . Musicals have song numbers in order to advance the plot or to show characters ' feelings . The singing in this music is not used to do either ; in fact , there 's no use for it at all . People just randomly sing to fit in with the plot . And that 's not the type of musical I know.The so-called plot of Fame has an onslaught of characters ( who are all introduced at once-last time I saw that in a movie [ Gosford Park ] it had disastrous results ) who audition for , and get into , New York High School for the Performing Arts . All of them are in for different reasons-i.e. acting , singing , etc . Quote-unquote drama unfolds as these middle-aged people pretending to be teenagers go through their four years.My largest complaint is that the high school is supposed to be selective . After all , it 's a free college , and they can 't let everyone in . So how is it that some people who are really bad get into the college ? Obviously so that drama could ensue between all of these different people . And why is the person top billed not even in the movie until near the end , for no reason at all , except to make us feel uncomfortable ? There 's many unsettling situations that these untalented people get into , yet you can 't feel bad for them because you don 't know who they are ! These relationships occur between people whose names you don 't know . And these characters realize things about themselves throughout the course of the movie , yet you don 't realize that , because you don 't know what they were like in the first place.As for the singing , it pops in randomly ( and is supposed to be humorous ? ) and does nothing . When the title song is sung , it 's played in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller everyone 's in the middle of the street dancing wildly and off-beat to it . The song itself is fine , but the whole scene , like the whole movie , is unnecessary . Fame is an unpleasant movie , to say the least . I would say more , but most of the movie has thankfully gone out of my head . Just don 't see it . You 'll be doing yourself a favor.My rating : 2 / 10Rated R for language . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Flat , soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film . Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise , you can even tell when the Bryan Adams vocals are going to come in , which are always at the wrong time.The main character , Spirit the horse , is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening . The narration is not needed , though , as everything happening is really obvious . You can even tell what the horses are saying , although all they do is neigh . Which would be good , but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning , one for sorrow , one for laughing , etc . There is no variation between the horses ' voices.Young kids might like this film , though . It 's soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch , and there 's little danger of anyone being frightened . If you have nothing else to do , and want to watch a film with your kids , this isn 't a bad choice.But otherwise , this isn 't recommended . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Quite possibly the worst movie I 've ever seen ; I was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes . The only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners . Don 't get me wrong , I love silly , stupid movies just as much as the next gal , but the whole premise , writing and humor stunk . It seemed to me that they were going for a " " Napoleon Dynamite " " feel - strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience . Instead , it ended up being forced , awkward and weird.The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I just felt utterly awful that she ( and Sissy Spacek ) had signed up for this horrible thing.Thank gosh I didn 't pay for it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Bah . Another tired , desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed.On the plus side , Toni Collette is superb as always ( being an actual actress , you see ) , and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes . There are even a few genuinely funny lines , and the filmwork , score and editing is competent , apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion.But , ah , but . Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot , and they are almost all very clearly too old ( and in one case too young ) for their declared ages . Worse , they are all speaking " " Austinese " , " that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldn 't be further from the way people actually spoke in Austen 's day ( think Yosemite Sam , I kid you not ) . This is particularly sad , considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial " " Fakespearan " " that Olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs.And worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow . She 's only ever played one character in her films , and she stays true to form here , running through her entire range ( smirking to sulking ) in the first ten minutes , then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film . There is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers , nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart.In short , there is very little reason to watch Emma . It 's an amiable enough adaptation , but if you 're going to pack a film full of anacronisms ( i.e. an appalingly thin lead who can 't shoot a bow or handle a period accent ) then you might as well do it properly , as with the vastly superior " " Clueless " .

" I Am Curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with political / socialism . Whatever the director 's intention , the two don 't really mesh together . The director should have just stuck with the romantic side of Lena and made a separate movie for the politics . There is a bizarre mixture of political / war rallies , Dr. King , serious political interviews , flopping breasts , and pubic hair . The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie . Other than the interesting sex scenes , you 'll be bored dry watching this film . Unlike many other reviewers , I think the nude / sexual scenes are overdone for what it is . If you want to see real porn , I 'm sure there are better choices . The pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is . I think the cast did a fine job however . They played their parts believably . There is little of the over-the-topness I 'm so used to seeing in the American films during this time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Gillian Anderson is an arrogant , driven , career woman who picks up working class oik Danny Dyer for a night of fun . After a stupid accident in the countryside , they are brutally attacked . After recovering , and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers , their thoughts turn to that of revenge ... I thought " " Straightheads " " was terrible . Violent , brutal , misogynistic and unpleasant . If I didn 't dislike the phrase a great deal I would call " " Straightheads " " a video nasty . Certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980 's . Frankly I don 't know how " " Straightheads " " got a cinema release.I am not a prude . I don 't mind sex and violence in the movies , but they have to be married to a movie with a ) a good plot or b ) good characterisation or c ) preferably both . " " Straightheads " " had neither . No progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid . Luckily " " Straightheads " " went nowhere fast . It was only 80 minutes long.It was a shame , because there was the germ of an interesting film here , with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third . How often do I say this , but it could have been good if it had been done properly . What a shame . I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer , but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film . She , especially , is very underrated ( and is still particularly fit ) .If you want to see a good British revenge movie , rent or buy Shane Meadows ' " " Dead Man 's Shoes " .

" Hello. this is my first review for any movie i have seen. i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally , the most disgusting movie i have ever seen . I feel like the movie was porely made , which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it . I felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw . Which i can agree , saw as well is also very graphic , but , i did like the movie saw.The scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen. the scene lasted almost forever , well actually , it was probably around 5 min but still. i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good. this director uwe boll , and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one. one final note haha ! ! FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY WATCHING ANIMALS BEATIN TO DEATH , LETTING ROT , WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS WELL AND A FIVE MINUTE SCENE OF SOMEONE GETTING THERE HEAD SMASHED IN WITH A HAMMER then you will enjoy this movie , if not , and you like horror , go with a higher budget film , like saw for example .

" Dark Harvest is about a group of friends that go to a farm ( it belongs to one of the friends relatives or something ) for a getaway . But there are killer scarecrows lurking there ( there was something about a curse in there too but I forgot what that was about ) .The acting in this movie is awful , I don 't know what the director was thinking when he was casting actors and actresses . The script is the same story as the acting " " awful " " ( this statement coming up is very obvious but .. ) if there was better acting and a better script this could have turned out " " okay " . " The directing stunk too , I see no potential in this guy 's future . After all these negatives this movie still maintains a " " fun " " factor that bumps it up to a two . The last plus is they don 't use CGI ! My overall thoughts on this film are it 's bad , real bad , but so bad it 's " " fun " " so it gets a 2 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yes , it 's true that it was Jessica Alba who leads me to this movie , because without her , I should have never pick it.But , I find it long , dull and above all , unoriginal .

I take notice to remember to avoid all his next movies.It 's a pity because all good things were at hand : Malaysia is a beautiful jungle , it was the British Empire and the cast is wonderful : Jessica knows how to open her soul and for one time , she has found an appropriate movie for this . Bob Hoskins shows a great experience and he should have won an award for this role.The only positive thing is that it makes me open a world-map to locate this island because if you guess it happens in south Asia , you don 't know where exactly !

" If at least the cruelty and drawn out deaths had a purpose to the story to justify their inclusion but the script was just unintelligible and just plain stupid.It went nowhere , the story had no legible continuity . It was just a bunch of drawn out pointless snuff scenes and a really stupid ending tacked on as if to say .. " " the end * beep * you my haters and my few defenders for watching my garbage . " " I don 't get it , a masked murderer who never had his mask removed in prison , a prison rape scene that was suppose to be the guards raping a a ugly deformed serial killer and getting killed by him and nothing else ? no explanation , no punishment , a really weak main cop character that was a waste of a actor like Pare , who didn 't try to off the guy who killed his cops , tortured a baby , a woman and a dog and sent them to you to watch on video.Cops who for some unknown reason all wandered off in the dark by themselves ( individually ) in his farm house at night like a bunch of poorly written teenage characters to be killed one at a time like a bunch of idiots , and no other cop hears them die in the darkness one after the other and just keep wandering around for no reason till each is killed in turn . A bunch of horrible real life animal snuff scenes in the beginning for no reason or explanation , was he reminiscing , was he watching it to masturbate , was it comedy for him ... what was it ? nope Boll just thought to throw it in to upset animal lovers .. whatever. then Pare believing the word of a psycho path to let his family go if he kills himself ... a more gullible , stupider cop you never saw in a film . I dunno why I try not to totally hate his works . I try to find some reason to explain a horror writers art but this stuff ... pure crap . Boll what are you doing anymore ?

" For a comedic writer , Woody Allen really lets the paying viewer down with this meager attempt at character development . There are a few entertaining moments , but no more than one would have listening to their dryer tumbling tennis balls.Will Ferrell wastes his time in this movie which fails to showcase his usually funny delivery . Amanda Peet did well , but again , didn 't have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like movie . The movie is so heavy and dull that it cannot be carried but if it were carried , Radha Mitchell did it .

" I can see what this film was intending to do . Unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal . The " " reality crime " " aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate . In fact quite a few of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody sort of way . Notably the silhouette of the detective talking to the beat up woman , the scene of the detectives going through the garbage , and the father tying flies . On occasion s few scenes bog down in too much dialog . Instead of showing the viewer the writer treats it too much like a book . But the real problem lies in the editing . The story does not flow . It fails to make a whole out of the sum of the parts . In the end you are confused as to what is actually happening . Those who like this sort of detective movie like to follow along , piecing together the puzzle at the same time the lead characters do . With such poor editing it is difficult if not nearly impossible to do this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just purchased this movie because I love to donate to Operation Smile , the charity on which the movie was based ... but I found the writing of the movie to be very strange . It t does not really focus so much on Operation Smile or similar organizations like The Smile Train and their Herculean efforts to relieve the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries . No , it concentrates on an American teenage volunteer , Katie , whose " " over-privileged " " life in Malibu , California , includes a mother who brings her to a doctor so that she 'll have birth control pills in her before she sleeps with her boyfriend . What is this birth control nonsense supposed to do , titillate the audience ? It 's 2005 . I 'd be more surprised if in 2005 a Malibu teen wasn 't on birth control , and even if she is , so what and who cares ? Contrasting Katie is the character of Lin in China , a girl with a facial deformity who missed last year 's chance to get an operation and this year does not want to have one . Neither character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify with , let alone understand the motivations of , either girl . On the other hand , the actors do an adequate job of trying to play the bad hand they were dealt by whoever wrote this ridiculous script . The best performance was by the gentleman playing Lin 's father although much of his dialogue is in Chinese and subtitled . Operation Smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking , but was I wrong . This film was boring , especially in the beginning and the middle parts .

" Assault on Precinct 13 is the absolute dumbest film I 've seen since Charlie 's Angels 2 . The shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with . SPOILERS ............................................................. I know they 've said this movie is a remake descendant of Rio Bravo but did the writers of this film actually watch Rio Bravo ? Besides the fact that Rio Bravo is a western classic , the premise of the film was that the sheriff ( John Wayne ) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being liberated by his brother and his gang . No one wants to liberate anyone in Assault on Precinct 13 . They want EVERYONE dead . So , my first question would have to be , WHY NOT JUST BURN THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN FROM THE START ? Why " " assault " " the place at all ? I know the contrived plot turn was suppose to be clever and shocking but it didn 't make sense and / or was presented properly . If the veteran cop was in on it from the start , why the need for this whole movie ? If the veteran cop suddenly cut a deal at the back door during the siege , how did he even get the chance ? As soon as he appeared at the door he would 've been shot and they would 've had their entry point . It 's all just FUBAR . What part of any city can an all out war take place at a police precinct ( complete with helicopters and massive explosions ) but no one notices ? ? However , as soon as there 's a fire they have to " " leave before the fire department shows up " " ? ? ? ? ? ? How did they plan to cover up the chaos that was happening outside ? ? Police issue bullets in the walls , bullet casings , footprints , equipment usage , and the fact that there were going to be no bodies of " " Bishop 's men " " to be found ? How about those police snipers ? How could they possibly miss so badly so often ? I like the fact that when the two detainees tried to run , the snipers were foiled by two tiny mounds of snow . As if it 's not possible to shoot a high powered riffle through a pile of snow . The set up was interesting although ridiculous but the movie just went off a cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet to the head for absolutely NO REASON at all . I know the makers of the film were going for shock but all they got was disgust at the cruelty and the anger of the audience . Don 't you think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and family to stay away from this one ? That particular scene has to be a big part of that word of mouth ( that and the fact that every plot turn is dumber then dirt ) . The conclusion remains steadily stupid as the villain pauses to deliver an Austin Powers-like diatribe instead of killing the helpless people who he has finally captured . I know several people have mentioned the closing scenes that take place in the woods of Detroit city ( > snicker < ) but why did Ethan 's character just wander off in to the woods in the first place ? He doesn 't even look to see if the SUV with the secretary and his friend gets away ? They just cut to him prowling slowly in the woods , pistol in hand . GACK . I could go on but won 't . All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all cost . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Here 's an indie film I really wanted to like , but ultimately could not . The lack of script ( boldly proclaimed in the main titles ) really shows through and kills the picture . The story is a nonsensical mess that isn 't worth trying to figure out . I quickly became bored within 10 minutes , then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes--hoping for the best--before hitting the chapter stops to ( mercifully ) get to the end ... even that wasn 't worth the extra effort . OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries too hard to be clever , lifting its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX . As a result , there 's very little in OZARK SAVAGE that hasn 't been done before , and better . This film would have been much more fun as a 10-20 minute short , but as a feature , it just feels padded and forced . Of course , there 's no money in shorts , so I completely understand the financial reasons that I assume motivated it being stretched out to 75 + minutes . Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise , and I wish him luck . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Just in case the title didn 't give it away - this movie is garbage.Short review ? Yeah.I decided to spend as much time writing this review as Hollywood probably decided to put into the script . I doubt it 'll be published considering how poorly I worded everything but if this is and anyone reads it -- stick to cherishing the first Sandlot movie . It completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way . The sequels aren 't ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be ashamed for ruining what has to be one of the most classic , original films of our childhood . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film was bad . I believe Elton ( or is it Mike ) Wong starred in it . Anyway it was the Wong that didn 't have that goofy grin and looks meaner . He plays a man who is hit over the head and suffers brain damage . He recovers and gets revenge . Gordon Liu is the only one worth seeing in this film , but he doesn 't get to do much . But what little he does seems to make theothers pale in comparison . Also , the film has some cheesy rubber hawk that the Wong guy controls .

" The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list shouldn 't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original 's satirical intent . Instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores , and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage , appropriately enough for a production that 's more Lionel ' Oliver ' Blair than Brecht . The acting talent is shamefully misused : Migenes and Walters are good but don 't have to try very hard : Migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material . Julia looks perfect as Mack , but struggles with the character , straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent . Harris 's Peachum is embarrassingly mannered and Polly is atrocious . The adaptations of lyrics , script and music are often awkward : it was a bad move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein 's bowdlerised Broadway version , but at least his words were singable , unlike most of what 's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness . And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement Vittorio Storaro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap , shoddy and thoughtlessly made . Disgraceful . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

All we have in this show is two stupid kids who keep doing an annoying laugh and they do OCCASIONAL funny things only in like ... 2 of the shows , while most of the others sucked ... as then they comment on music videos which I cannot stand personally while they either love or like.In most episodes , the only things you will hear are the repitive " " let 's go score with some chicks " , " or " " I 'll kick your ass beavis " , " or the better yet and usually used quote " " that was cool " , " and above all , their annoying laugh.If you want a good animated show , try The Simpsons , Ren and Stimpy , South Park , this show is just not worth the time or energy it takes to watch this awful MTV series truthfully . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Getting lost in space frozen for 15 years , that 's unlikely . Falling into a star ... improbable . Falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes ... ludicrous . Getting rescued by a ship just then ... priceless.No , it 's not Zaphod Beeblebrox 's Heart of Gold to the rescue . It 's also not the Parent of the Year awardees . After sentencing her daughter to two years ' solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship , the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man they 've picked up . This foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat , which makes up most of the film 's action . Combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away , who obligingly simpers in the line of fire.In the end , the family of three abandons the metropolis-sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave , instead using the psycho 's fighter ship which they 've refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 0.7-kiloton missile .

" This film is awful . The screenplay is bad , the is script mediocre , and even the sex scenes are worthless . The thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking . This movie was shot in a dark , shadowy and monochromatic style ( a la " " War of the Worlds " " ) , which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film . Greg Morrisey 's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film . The twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here ; the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic . The only highlight is Sharon Stone 's performance as Catherine Tramell , faithfully continued in this sequel , but it isn 't enough to make up for the other shortcomings . The only circumstance under which a " " Basic Instinct 3 " " should be made would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Your idol will deceive you in this movie . Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending under his father 's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years-old . This makes his relationship ( a collection of copulation scenes , basically ) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing . The character 's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe . Nichols , who is one of daytime TV 's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie : watching him have sex over and over with this girl . It 's like watching two animals going at it . If you 're a fan of this actor 's talent in other projects , don 't rent this for you will never view him in the same way . If , on the other hand , you want to see Stephen Nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera , you might like it : Stephen will show you his naked butt , lots of tongue work , his groaning range , but not his talent as this character who 's obviously just as sex-driven and misjudging as he was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera .

" Vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel , however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android ( Kris Kristofferson ) and a warrior woman ( Kathly Long ) as they face off against Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels ( Who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie ) Of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie , the most poignant is Who 's idea was it to cast country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets . No , don 't get me wrong I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg . Strangely one suspects that this was written for Dolph Lundgren , however Lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it . However despite the disastrous casting , Kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie . He gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive Kathy Long . ( And Kristofferson is playing a robot ) despite the miscasting , Kristofferson provides the few moments of interest . Lance Henriksen is slumming and Gary Daniels is wasted but basically Knights is baffling failure . You stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper . ( This is a movie where a dismembered Kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack ) Worst of all it ends in a what if sequel , thankfully this has yet to materialize although I still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event . * out of 4- ( Bad ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In the mid-1970s , my NYC apt. building was finally wired for cable-TV and since Showtime ( instead of HBO ) was the only premium channel offered showing recent movies , I signed up for it . Being a writer and night-owl by nature , I soon discovered the channel was showing movies late at night and until the wee hours of the morning I 'd never even heard of--most of them American independent films and foreign films that had never been given a U.S. theatrical release . Many of them had recognizable " " star " " casts and respectable directors , and thanks to Showtime , I discovered many first-rate films I ( and other Showtime subscribers ) would never else have had the opportunity to see . Most of these cinematic mongrels were indeed " " dogs " " but often so bad they were unintentionally hilarious . One night , Showtime unveiled a little Italian-made gem called " " Redneck " " ( filmed in 1972 , given a limited European release in 1973 ) . Even though the movie had never been released in the U.S. , the MPAA rating was listed as an ' R ' . Since the director was one Sylvio Narizzano ( the director who made his name with the glorious " " Georgy Girl " " ) , and the three leads were Mark ( " " Oliver " " ) Lester , Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas , I decided to give it a try . And found myself nailed to my TV screen in disbelief for 89 minutes . As I recall , Savalas and Testi played two criminals , the former a raging maniac who , in one stomach-churning scene , casually sent a German family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff , thereby plunging to the wilderness depths below . So far , so bad . Then , out of nowhere , Testi ( as the " " nice " " psycho ) and Lester ( all of 14 when the movie was made ) are seen , both nude , in a men 's room , Testi sneaking peeks at the kid 's body while shaving , and poor confused Lester fixated on close-ups of Testi 's naked butt . As a not-yet-jaded member of the movie industry , and a card-carrying liberal ( I was as much against censorship then as I am today ) , the entire movie made me queasy ( and , being the early ' 70s when I thoughtI 'd seen everything in the anything-goes movies of that liberated era--including the uncut version of Altman 's " " That Cold Day in the Park " , " a real jaw-dropper until it was trimmed for an ' R ' rating and would have spelled The End for Altman 's career had he not next come up with something called " " M * A * S * H " " ) , I still wonder if anyone else except me ever saw " " Redneck " " and was appalled as I was . Trashing the actors and movie-going audiences is joy maladjusted filmmakers have been merrily indulging in since the beginning of time . But leeringly exploiting a highly respected and talented child actor ( Mr. Lester ) at a time when he was beginning to make the difficult transaction from child to adult actor ( and I 'm sure his film offers had thereby dwindled to meretricious junk like " " Redneck " " ) ... Mr. Narizzano , you should be hanging your head in shame . ( Incidentally , I was soon to make friends with actors who had appeared in Narizzano 's future , undistinguished efforts . They both despised him . Surprise ? ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Going down as the most expensive film in Finnish history , to date , " " Dark Floors " " is a horror film with an extremely Lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of " " Floors " " ( ironically enough ) in an abandoned hospital , in which our protagonists are trapped . Lead by an autistic daughter and her father , himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter , make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses . Accompanied by a security guard , a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned , but they are not alone . Directed by Finnish- born Pete Riski , more known for his television work , " " Dark Floors " " is filmed in English , using mainly English actors but has the notable inclusion of Finland 's arguably most famous group " " Lordi " " ( 2006 Eurovision song contest winners ) as themselves , i.e. in their on stage monstrous costumes , as the films antagonists , yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most , in convincing the audience.Any film that has their lead character use the phrase " " it 's too quiet " " is already headed down a dubious path , and this Lordi influenced horror does not break that convention . For all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of ripe clich챕s alongside and worst of all , anything that is interestingly original isn 't fleshed out enough for it to resonate . The concept of the degrading floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the mire . However , there isn 't enough atmosphere created to scare and intimidate the audiences into the unknowing fear , the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous , as the levels degenerate from shiny white through to hellish black , but I don 't think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening . Also , the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch , a concept not often used in the horror genre , but the characters don 't confront the situation with enough fear and trepidation when they stumble across this fact , they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience . These initially good ideas are just left to go to waste , as if the director and / or Mr Lordi ( who had many of the ideas used within the film ) had these thoughts , but couldn 't agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point . Yet for all the frustration there are large quantities of comedy , yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for . Too much is clich챕d , too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous . While the lead is amicably acted by Noah Huntley , the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been pasted into the story from other films . We have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a clunkily developed love interest . Accompanying the " " couple " " we have the traditional token black man as a hard-nosed security guard , with the nigh on infinite clip for his sidearm , and a weasely disbelieving businessman only on the look out for himself . Worst of all though , unfortunately , is the introduction of the cast of Lordi as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of misfits , but not for them appearing as themselves . What makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is contextualising the fear . " " The Shining " " is scary because it 's a member of your own family hounding you , in " " Dawn Of The Dead " " it 's our fear of each other and the primordial cannibalism and irrational thought patterns the zombies possess , in " " Alien " " the fear is explained , the creature is rationalised and in " " Dark Floors " " there is none of that . Perhaps it 's unfair to compare this production to these monoliths of the genre but when you do it shows it pales significantly and that it 's aggressors feel like nothing more than demented Klingons where you can almost see the zip on the costumes they wear , without a build up of any atmosphere " " Lordi " " just aren 't scary.It 's infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well , you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as " " Hollywood " " churns out , much in the similar way that George A Romero started out , but it doesn 't always materialise . I enjoyed the film and didn 't feel as if I had wasted the ninety minutes I had just sat through , but I felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously , emotionally or critically . I felt the almost Lynchian narrative was a standout plus point , but it fades out into nothingness . Why did it happen ? What does it mean ? Will they go through this all again ? Without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty . Was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence ? Had the autistic girl watched the Eurovision Song Contest of 2006 and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under ? Who knows ? And unfortunately I fail to work up the energy to even care . " " Dark Floors " " is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from Mr Lordi , who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas . It 's one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" To be brutally honest ... I LOVED watching Severed . That 's why Igave it a 1 / 10 stars because of its starkly unimaginativestory / filming / acting / everything . This film was a RIOT to watch . Ifyou enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them , you willreally get a kick out of Severed.The story really doesn 't matter , it involves some guy who 's baldand has a sword and goes around beheading random people . But he has a supernatural twist ... nobody ever sees him do it . Even when , in one very memorable scene , he walks into ajampacked night club and whacks off some girl 's noodle andnobody sees it . Severed doesn 't merely look like it was filmed on video- it WASfilmed on someone 's home camcorder .

" This movie has one of the worst lead characters ever . I say this because he is made out to be the hero when , in my opinion , everything he does in the whole movie screws up people 's lives and causes problems . He can do nothing right , yet the movie makes him seem like the cool dude everyone should be looking up to . He has temper tantrums at all the wrong times , he has all the wrong stances on things that end up making people mad at him and getting people killed , he is too nosy , too pushy , too macho , too assuming , makes all the wrong decisions and has no common sense . It 's about a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the woman and son that he walked out on years ago . The detective finds the woman and what he thinks to be her son . However , all kinds of things happen to make this story full of crime , drama and twists . It 's made for TV , what do you expect ? Anyhow , the movie is fairly entertaining . Johnny Depp is very young in this one and has an awful 80 's haircut . He chews gum and tosses a soccer ball around for about 5 minutes and that is all we get to see of him.For some reason , the out of print VHS version of this sells for $ 40 in online auctions . It must be for Johnny Depp collectors only . It couldn 't be because of the plot . It couldn 't be . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'll start blasting the movie first . Remove Abbott and Costello from the cast and you 've got a badly colored movie , stiff cardboard from the casting department , badly dubbed sound ( especially during the singing ! ) and annoying dialog ( ex. listen to the line " " Mr. Dinklepuss " " ad infinitum ) . Obviously some studio hack thought that they could cash in on Disney 's CLASSIC presentation of " " Mickey and the Beanstalk " , " but maybe audiences were either more gullible back then ( improbable ) or stuck in a double feature ( more probable ) . Even children should feel insulted at having this movie shown to them . A total waste of celluloid . Now , about the acting of Abbott and Costello . Bud Abbott always played the straight man , and by all accounts was the nicer person off the set . On radio , his character was usually the smooth fast talker , and was especially funny when his speed caused him to flub his lines and smooth over the mistakes . In the movies , he still plays the straight man , but is more of a con artist . Not that he 's bad at it , but that character has been played to perfection by Groucho Marx . The real travesty of the duo on film is Lou Costello . Again , on radio he was funny . He played a character that was a little slower than Abbott , but not too much slower ! He was also glib with the lines , and got me laughing when he would ad-lib at Abbott 's mistakes . On film , I don 't know if it was his decision or not , but in the movies his character becomes a shoddy impersonation of Stan Laurel , which in turn was even more shoddily done by Jerry Lewis . Why the change ? he was funny on radio when he was a smarta-- , but here he becomes a child-like character that looks like he 's mugging for the cameras in every shot. this characterization is shown in every movie they do , and only brings a stain to the reputation they had on radio . What is left to their film career is a poor ( very , VERY poor ) copy of Laurel and Hardy . The movies would have been much funnier if they had played their radio characters instead of retreads of stock casting . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Shocking ! In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive . He was sincere , unpretentious and kindly , he was at ease and looked like well-educated and intellectual person . In this movie I saw a clown ! The actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry . They made a cartoon ! The real Gagarin was someone else ! Don 't believe in this movie ! I saw this movie after the movies like " " Taming of Fire " " and " " Apollo 13 " " and after reading books " " Rockets and People " " by Chertok and " " Korolev : Myths and Facts " " by Golovanov . I was shocked by tiresome scenario , poor acting and producing , and a lots of inexactitudes of " " Space Race " . " The movie is the tedious rendering of well-known in Russia historical facts . A lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated . Some facts and details were perverted . For example , in 1945 Korolev was already not a prisoner ( liberated in 1944 ) , and in 1940 he was already not in Kolyma prison gold mine , but in special prison design bureau . Korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners . But in the movie Korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 ( because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform ) . IMHO , the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can 't to make interesting movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women .

Many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact , using absurdity and obscenity . The attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails.My personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie ( My god , it hurts in my head every time I call it " " movie " " ) : A bold attempt to turn nothing into something great . But it failed . At least the director made something out of nothing . But it isn 't something good.Many movies didn 't turn out as funny as they were planned , but this one tops them all . It 's the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making . No . To correct myself , it 's even worse than that . A movie with gags so bad , that they aren 't funny at all .

" Possible Spoiler alert , though there 's not much to spoil about this film . I saw Project A part II not having seen the first movie . I don 't think I missed much . Project A Part Two is not only the worst Jackie Chan film I 've seen to date ( yes worse than ' Fantasy Mission Force ' ) , this film is one of the most unwatchable films the world has ever seen . It 's right up there with ' Plan 9 From Outer Space ' on the sleep inducing scale . The plot is twisted up and knotted like a 50 foot ball of yarn the cat 's been playing with and finally left for dead . The ' humor ' if you could call it that , seems to have been written by an annoying High School freshman , who despite how many people tell him he 's not funny , is determined to get his lame humor out no matter how painful a movie is made . And this movie is painfully bad . The plot involves Jackie Chan as a Navy officer recruited by the police force to round up ' all known criminals ' . He rounds them up in the first half hour of the movie , and I prayed for a quick ending which I didn 't get . Why the movie bothers to progress from this point I haven 't a clue . The movie drags on and on and on with no purpose , no plot , and attempts at humor that fail so miserably , they make Carrot Top look like a comedic genius . The Kung Fu in this movie is lame , and forgettable . There 's better Kung Fu in that movie about the 3 Ninja kids . Project A part II is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie , it is however a complete waste of the talents of Jackie Chan and Maggie Cheung who have made films worlds superior to this . As Jackie Chan repeatedly escapes certain death , I enter ' Blair Witch ' mode asking ( and wishing ) ' Is he going to die NOW , so the movie can end ? ' . An Example of how ludicrous this movie is : Jackie Chan is handcuffed to another man . A gang of pirates ( that look nothing like pirates ) throw axes at Jackie . Does Jackie grab one of the wayward axes and break the chain on the handcuffs ? No ! You see that would spoil the ' hilarious ' gag of him being handcuffed to another person . If you have a friend who laughs at everything , I encourage you to watch this movie with him or her , and watch as even they won 't get a chuckle out of this film . If you 're an insomniac this movie is sure to put you to sleep . Do not operate heavy machinery while watching Plan A part II . Possible side effects include headache , retinal strain , and death by boredom . 0 / 9 Stars , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Piranha starts out as expected , stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them . I thought for a while it might be a cannibal film . It starts off like so many others , showing nothing but shots off untouched Amazon rain forest . For all I know it could be Florida . At this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up . Instead you get the acting talents of William Smith , who starred in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard . He plays Caribe , an acclaimed hunter , who I would describe him as Jack Palance Light . He is bigger in stature , but not quite the Jack Palance goodness . As for natives , you don 't really get that many . Where 's the piranha ? Should I even ask that question ? Caribe now hunts humans , I guess . He doesn 't really pursue anyone till the end of the movie though , just stares at them . Caribe does race one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a over-dramatic Smokey and the Bandit kind of way . The motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason other than an action sequence . I can 't tell you how many times I 've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle . Never actually . Do they live , do they die ? Will you care ? Anybody wanna race on motorcycles ? Caution : this film contains extreme dry look .

" " from some characters. like the lady who doesn 't want to hear his version of the bible.about the story itself , everyone is free to write about what they want , and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination. i credit the book author for that , hence , my 4 / 10.so , in the end , hear the man 's story believe it or not , just don 't spend the whole time acting like you believe him and being shocked at what he says , and at the same time moving around and making jokes like you don 't believe him.Coherence.thanks for reading ; ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you 're a kid liking fairy tale " " real life " " adventures , see it .

The start of this film was a bit funny , and set some good premises for the happenings to take place . But after the kind of funny introduction of characters , settings and potential conflicts , the story turned out kinda dull . When more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time , the word " " predictable " " repeatedly comes to mind just like parts of a dented LP or those commercials you really hate .

" This movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the Left Behind series . I did not know it would be a Bible-thumping movie . I expected it to truly be a movie about UFOs and alien abduction for entertainment 's sake . As previous reviewer comments , it would be fine to show at a church , but not at a public theater , at least not without the consumer 's prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about . I felt deceived out of my $ $ spent for this movie , as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones . If you go to church , it 'll probably be shown there for free some time . Other than the cover-up of its true subject matter , the movie was fine as far as acting and script were concerned . But I have to say I walked out an hour into the movie when I saw what direction it was headed and that I was not going to be entertained , but preached to . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This movie feels so EMPTY . IN every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10 . Because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird.The ACTING was HORRIBLE ! It 's so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor / actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives .. Looking at the floor for their marks ... Spoilers : Also you 'll find yourself banging your head watching the movie . At one point at Sky Captain 's home base they have like 100 planes sitting on the airstrip . They have advanced warning an attack is coming ... So what do they do ? nothing . All of the planes get blown up and yet again the ONLY person fighting back is the Sky Captain ... THE ENTIRE world is under attack and he 's the ONLY person ever fighting back . At the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally ... but what do they do ? Nothing ... the movie is over ... , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a Saw-type movie or 12 Angry Men ( people piecing together the facts to get at the truth ) . Whatever it was , it was poorly done and not worth watching.I don 't watch movies for blood and gore , but because this film had little else going for it , it should have shown the actual killing more . Most were off-camera , minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths.It also bugged me that the cop was among the victims ; he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence ( given to him by MJH ) into the evidence room . ( And wouldn 't MJH a the prosecuting attorney , have had access to that evidence--taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back--anyway , so she wouldn 't have needed the cop 's help ? ) . The others , while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming , still played larger roles in his ultimate demise . The gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent . The insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need , etc . But the cop 's crime seemed minor in comparison since he didn 't know exactly what he was doing . The filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged MJH to plant the evidence , which would have made him more culpable . And MJH 's yelling that he ( the cop ) got her in that mess doesn 't make any sense at all.It would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why he / she was there and deserved to die . The insurance guy , for example , could have had the applications he rejected rammed down his throat so he choked on them ; the Oriental woman could have had her eyes gouged out because she was a false witness , etc . Yes , more violent that the gun deaths , but more interesting.The dialog wasn 't witty , there were no twists , and the ending was one of the worse ( if not the worst ) I 've ever seen . The ending along knocked three stars off my rating.The actors did a decent job , especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with.Overall , a waste of time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I don 't know what I missed here , but I can 't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film . I thought it was silly , and a bit over the top . I did like the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker , however the others were just ... boring.Now I like B movies , I really do , but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me . I saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to " " Army Of Darkness " " and " " Shaun of the Dead " , " as well as " " On par with The Re-Animator " . " You must be joking . I didn 't find this film funny , it tried , it did make an effort , ( possibly too much of an effort ) , but it failed in my opinion . By the time I was hit with the 3rd or 4th one-liner I was rolling my eyes and checking my watch.There were definitely homages made to several other films , which is always cool , kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans . But here it may have just been a lack of original thought . Admittedly there were some nice special effects , good gore , but that can 't carry an entire movie . The mutated Grant looked like a cross between Jabba the Hut , and in the early stages of mutation- Chet from " " Weird Science " " ( after he was turned into the monster ) and one of the alien creature / children from " " The Explorers " . " It just didn 't work . I thought it looked like something some kid from Grade 5 art class could have designed . Then there was Brenda , the woman that Grant impregnated and chained up in the barn . When help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped . The design once again was totally unimaginative . A round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle . * yawn * Now about the zombies- The more movies I see with zombies in them these days the more I wish George A. Romero had a patent on them and was the only writer / director allowed to make movies about them . He 's the only person so far to do it right , with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg ( but that was a comedy ) . Oh , and Danny Boyle , but they were a different style of Zombie . Maybe Mr. Romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan , groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid , and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were re-animated . The people of " " Wheelsy " " just didn 't have the proper motivation ... they were horrible zombies.So in the end I give " " Slither " " a 3 , for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This * should * have been an amazingly funny movie ... but it falls flat on its face . ( In fact , I stopped watching it halfway through , which is something I rarely do ... ) -- Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran , a second-rate motivational speaker who is bequeathed an elephant by his father ( whom he had presumed to be dead before he was born ) ; he then has one week to get the ponderous pachyderm across the country . His adventures on the way are only mildly amusing at best . Janeane Garofalo 's considerable comedic talents go largely untapped . Anita Gillette is impressive in her small role as Jack 's mother ( who has a lot of explaining to do ) , and Pat Hingle stands out as a former circus associate of Jack 's father . -- Perhaps the second half of the movie was better than the first , but I find that hard to believe ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This might have been fun , second-string material for Abbott & Costello , but Frank Sinatra looks lost and embarrassed in the lead . Combination of raucous comedy and musical interludes are hindered by the poor staging ( Sinatra is photographed singing at one point in a mirror , but one doesn 't concentrate on his performance so much as noticing how odd the star appears reflected in this way ! ) .

" Yep , this has got to be one of the lamest movies I 've ever seen . It 's utterly tasteless , has no style whatsoever , the story is so thin that you can watch television through it , and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil tanker through it.Sure , I appreciate a good B-movie as much as most male white homo sapiens do . But this has got to be the worst I 've seen . In fact it 's so B that it lacks everything that makes a B-movie interesting.The whole movie is based around such charming artefacts as the characters beating the crap out of each other , various bodily functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything on-screen.It 's not even funny . In fact it 's quite the opposite . I found it even boring at times due to it 's extreme predictability.I find nothing good to say about this movie .

" I couldn 't bear to sit through he entire movie . Do families like this really exist somewhere ?

" It 's hard to believe , after waiting 14 years , we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage . The original was a high impact , dark thriller that achieved " " cult " " status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven . This film adds nothing , delivers nothing , and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels.The opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast . Unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self-indulgent life of Catherine Tramell ... or is it Sharon Stone . Possibly a copulation of both.If the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in " " B.S.1 " , " forget it . You wind up with soft-porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them . It 's interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling was romping around in her skivvies , via the 1966 GEORGY GIRL , when Ms. Stone was only 8 years old . A very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here.If you 're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system . If not , you might as well wait for the DVD release in the " " rated " " version , " " unrated " " version , " " collectors " " edition , or " " ultimate " " version , and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of " " Basic Instinct 3 " " at which point Ms. Stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Be they silent , black and white , no budget or big budget , there are very few of them that I can 't find something to like about . That said , I 'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that 's all . This is a case of effects over story . Truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn 't been seen in a horror film . Therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good , original story . A good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie . This movie doesn 't even have good acting , only good effects .

" I just have to add , in case anyone actually reads this and hasn 't completely gotten the point yet . These other reviewers aren 't joking around , this really IS the worst colour movie you 're likely to ever see . When the movie started I couldn 't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see.They 're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie . It really does . Like the " " director " " took the family hi8 camcorder ( before DV cameras and computer non-linear editing ) , no other equipment ( lights , sound gear , etc ) , grabbed some decent-looking acting students , and went out to shoot a movie . No script , just making it up as he went along.When I watched it , it was on my mono TV , so I only have one channel of audio ( left of right speaker ) . At first I thought I 'd hooked it up wrong . The movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in . I got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects but then couldn 't hear the dialog . They recorded the sound on different bloody channels ! I mean , there 's movies that can be funny to watch , so bad they 're good , kind of thing . I 'm not sure this is one of those . I mean , I 'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker . And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and PROVE you can do it better , you know . But watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it.As bad as they were , the actors are the only good thing about this . I thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene . A bit of T and A from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4 . But alas , no . If you want to make a movie but it 's turning out crap , throw in some gratuitous nudity . Worked for Roger Corman . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Cronica de un desayuno combines the worst defects of mexican cinema , a rare feat nowadays.It 's pretentious : it wants us to believe that it is deep , only because some scene is out-of-focus , another is pseudo-surreal , yet another plays with the Eisenstein-Infante-Caifanes tradition of laughing-crying faces , the edition is fragmented , and it is all so solemn.It has a weak script : the main story hardly develops , so it has other three smaller , needless stories , stuck into it . They are only good to make the film last longer.Most of the acting is bad . A true feat , baring in mind that many of the best known mexican actors were cast.There is an abuse of unnecesary foul language . To the point that the character of Paloma , who symbolizes the dreams of freedom of a child , uses it throughly.It is homophobic . The character played by Eduardo Palomo is the sorriest , and most punished , representation of a transexual I have ever seen.It is very boring .

" While babysitting at an isolated Colorado house , a teen girl is terrorized by an elusive murderer on the telephone.Remake of the 1979 semi-classic horror film basically takes the opening 20 minutes of the original film and stretches it out to fit an 87 minute time span ! So it 's pretty needless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin . There 's little in the way of originality or interest in this movie . There 's a lot of Camilla Belle wondering around a dark house wondering who 's calling her and encountering all kinds of false scares . It all gets repetitious and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to muster up much in the way of suspense or chills . It certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film , especially since it wimps-out and changes one important plot point from the original . I guess we have the PG-13 rating to thank for that.On the plus side there 's an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere , unfortunately there 's not much going on around it to save this remake from being sub-par . Belle 's performance is pretty mediocre too.It 's just another unimpressive remake . * 1 / 2 out of * * * * , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Through its 2-hour running length , Crash charts the emotional anguish of its 10-odd ensemble of characters when faced with the sometimes blatant and sometimes latent forms of racism underlying in American society . That and the emotional anguish of one of its audiences sitting near the front and desperately trying to make sense of what movies have become these days.The era we live in has become so complicated . Not only do we reject modernism , even the not very enthusiastic flag-waving of post-modernism ideas is always being shot down by what , post-post-modernism that aims to destroy all these ideas , all in no part thanks to the great destructivist ideas of those great ' thinkers ' . But I digress . This has nothing much to do with the what the movie is about , but rather what the movie is.Sure , it seems hard to earn a living in a Hollywood that has to cater to a market that is so post-post-post everything that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life . It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think of whether we like it or not . And so a new studio product is born ! Indie films , which once were energetic and idealistic in its defiant experimentalism now seem to be as equally adamant as Hollywood films to sell to indie film markets . An indie film must sell at Sundance before becoming ' acclaimed ' . And so nothing is simple anymore . Even what constitutes a good film becomes so murky . Whereas in the past filmmakers just wanted to entertain people and tell a good story--and in these seemingly simplistic attempts the greatest of films are borne--filmmakers nowadays have to make films that are good first and foremost ; films have to make people think , have to be meaningful , has to be provocative , raise questions , yadda yadda yadda . What it all boils down to , is a subversion of the Hollywood movie system , but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formulaic similarity of Hollywood films , the countless ways of differing to essentially be the same product.And I haven 't even begun on the film yet . Maybe I 've become too picky on films I see these days . Maybe it 's because of my primary need to be entertained , rather than , say , be probed when seeing a movie . But hell , this movie is one big load of crap . And I 'm repulsed by this movie not just because it follows the How to Make a Good Movie Good 101 guidebook to the T--characters spout eloquent lines and are sooo witty like they 're gifted with the speech of God ; it raises issues about racism and life confronting racism in America ; it has ' touching ' moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people ; not to mention the fact that once you hear the ambient / new age soundtrack of women singing in high registers in foreign languages , you know you 're in for all of the above traits.And something about the aforementioned point--about it raising questions about immediately-compelling issues like racism--pisses me off big time . Like all post-post-post-post-post everything movies , it doesn 't contend with just having a message about this issue . Because oh , our audiences are much to intelligent for that these days in this post-post-post-post world . Our audiences want us to make them think , doesn 't want us to put things so simplistically , ( and then they will go into existentialist crap and say ) that 's because life itself isn 't simplistic . Ha ha ha . What other common drill do we here then the audience need to think about issues rather than have them fed to them . Okay , okay , and okay . So the film makes it a point to pound the audiences with these non-messages and since they 're not exactly a message , it 's so decidedly subtle and subtle means good right ? So we 're being hit again and again with this well-written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose . And as if the irony is not steep enough , we have Ludicrous ' character , the only character who seems to not take all these racism discussion bullshit seriously , being ' converted ' into one of those irritatingly meaningful characters where he learns something in the end , giving meaningful looks and pauses where audiences are supposed to ' learn something about themselves too ' . Um , yeah . How I wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after this man.To cut the long bullshit short , I guess I wouldn 't have taken issue with the film if it wasn 't so bloated in its self-importance . The angst that forms the entire movie felt more like white-boy whining than actual Spike Lee-ish anger . It 's so Tim Robbins and Sean Penn , the type that wants to wave flags about humanitarianism when the only thing they don 't realize is the flag they 're waving is their hole-ridden underwear . Plus it 's become so trendy in the post-post-post-post world to be completely subtle about it . Nothing is simple any longer . In its best efforts to actually be good , provocative , and ultimately human , it 's become neither , imho , just another indie crap from an indie director that wants to make a name out of himself as a credible indie-filmmaker . Now at least Hollywood is more simple and sincere in its manipulativeness . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie , I think he likes it too . ) It 's amazing how intelligent people , talented even fall in to the same trap.I really like Reshamiya . It 's amazing what he has done . No one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.And I truly expected a great film ( What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress ) . As intense as Reshamiya is I thought , he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role . Ironically he is depicted the same but for what care ? Sheer incompetence , carelessness , awful acting , banal background music , insensitive direction make it a real pain.Blunders rule . ( Ex . How can German Police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in English ? They communicate among themselves in English ! ) Unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line Bollywood . There are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too . The worse thing is that the majority just doesn 't care.Songs are the only saving grace ... Please don 't repeat this HR and find yourself a good director ( low budget .. No problem ) .The villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know ... after all it 's a 50Cr movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

However , this film did make me smile and feel good inside . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say that Mike Mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit .

" STAR RATING : * * * * * The Works * * * * Just Misses the Mark * * * That Little Bit In Between * * Lagging Behind * The Pits Based on another of Stephen King 's lengthy novellas , this takes place in the sleepy little New England town of Castle Rock ( also the name of the film 's production company ! ) , where a new antiques store , the titular Needful Things , has opened . The owner and proprietor , Leland Gaunt ( Max Von Sydow ) hides , you might say , a devilish secret . There 's an item in his store that everyone in the little town wants-a small cash price upfront is first required , before a far more sinister price is asked for . As suspicion , hate and madness tear the town apart , it falls to police chief Alan Pangborn ( Ed Harris ) to restore order and save the town from a terrifying end ... I read the novel of Needful Things earlier this year , and was eager to watch the movie adaptation again to compare them ( like that was going to be any contest ! ) But it had been deleted on video and DVD and I couldn 't find anywhere to rent it from . So I was happy when I finally found it in a flea market whilst on a shopping trip ... It 's one of the cruelest ironies that King novels are generally the best to read but when they get adapted to screen nine times out of ten they are complete junk , as is the case here . The material that makes his books great simply doesn 't translate into a movie script very well , for some reason . And I suppose there 's always the question : why bother watching this when I could be reading the book again instead ? I appreciate that some are simply too lengthy ( i.e. It , The Stand ) to be made into a complete screen work with all the situations and characters included , but there 's no reason this one couldn 't have included all the material from the book . As a result , a lot of key characters from the book ( i.e. Ace Merrill ) are not included at all and we have some terrible character development that means we don 't care about the characters that are involved since they are so stripped of depth and motivation- for example we have one character from the book , Danforth Keaton , who murders his wife toward the end yet we were shown no build-up to hint at any reason that he didn 't get along with or hated her and so it has no impact when it happens , unlike in the book where there was a lot of depth invested and it really involved you to find out what happened to the characters involved . All the material in the script to fill in the cracks , if you like , is really stupid and corny and the typically goofy stuff that gets included in King adaptations like this.Most of the film 's problems are that it deviates so far away from the book but there 's also some terrible acting from a cast that obviously can 't feel for the daft material they 're being asked to perform . In the 90s , a lot of King 's work started skipping the cinema and just being made into made-for-TV / video territory . Rubbish like this must surely hint at why . * * , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This serial is interesting to watch as an MST3K feature , but for todays audience that 's all it is . I was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952 .

This is the worst of the toxie series by far . The acting in Tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time . The major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original . Like there 's a different girl friend of toxie 's in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick . Why is this film made like a Disney movie . After about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all . There 's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop . After the films 20 minutes are up the film is bearly entertainment . H * LL IT 'S BEARLY WATCHABLE . Well unless your drunk then don 't watch this film .

" * * * Possible spoilers * * * I 've read up on Dahmer a little and saw the new Dahmer film ( with the same name ) at an earlier time . This movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings , too little on Dahmer himself . The film called " " Dahmer " " had the opposite problem , it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself.I did not find the acting to my satisfaction , it had a certain amateur feel too it , especially the probation officer . It also seemed as if the Dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor . But I might be wrong about that.What annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show " " the real deal " " about what he did anyway . That is ok - but what I then don 't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while Dahmer was out getting beer , was not depicted being naked , since that is also how it happened . It 's not a big deal , but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out . What wasn 't shown either or not even really hinted was Dahmers sexual obsession with the dead . Again , I don 't mind they didn 't SHOW it , but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehow.Conclusion : I think the really good Dahmer film is still to be made , a movie that incorporates not only Dahmers crimes but also who he was , and why he did what he did . I think that 1.5 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all . This movie was just a cutout ( excuse the pun ) of Dahmers life and personality and does not give you any ' close to good ' insight into his life or personality.4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Chris Kattan at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer , who runs a dance studio in a warehouse .

I like laugh out loud comedies , this was not one . " " Not Another Teen Movie " " wasn 't funny , but had a lot more funny scenes than Totally Awesome . " " Scary Movie " " is suuuper funny .

Why did people like Halloween ? Because it was original , new and went beyond anything that 's ever been done . Why did they like Scream ? Because at least it made sense . Valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that has hardly any gore what so-ever . The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend it 's not funny .

" It 's supposed to have got good reviews ' says the g / f . If so , I can 't find them . She goes off to sleep and I endure . Michael Douglas as a good ol ' boy - now there 's a new one . Matt Dillon all screwed up . John Goodman losing his cool . Paul Reiser running around in BDSM leather . Oh it 's a riot all right.The hitch is you 're probably going to lose interest pretty soon on . Liv Tyler plays the femme fatale and critics complain she might not have the register for her part . But it 's immaterial : this movie is not about character development . In fact I 'd go so far as to say there 's no character at all . What you 're supposed to appreciate here is the plot.No one is ' bad ' in this movie . Some people wonder why all these ' stars ' - Reba 's even in here for goodness sake - sign up for such a junky project . Odds are they thought it would be fun . Maybe they did have fun . Who knows ?

This movie has beautiful scenery . Unfortunately it has no plot . In order to have a plot there must be a conflict . This movie had none . It spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and failed to ever place any activity in it .

" I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt . The opening moments , with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter , Diana , about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art , give the impression that this could be a kick-ass artsy-vampire flick . Turns out this initial impression turns out false . Oh , Troma , the mark of some kind of lack of quality : sometimes they 'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk-food craft ( or , sometimes not ) . This is a case where it 's not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor ( i.e. the protagonist 's father is an old vaudevillian who does Jimmy Durante impressions ? ) are weak at best , and any unintentional laughs are undercut by Sergio Lapel 's bargain basement direction.And it 's not without him trying , oh Lord no . He does try a lot , which is a big part of the problem . He and his producers had money for lights , sure , but the way they 're used in the movie made I , a former student filmmaker and aspiring director , sulking in my seat : if I saw this in a theater I would have to blind my eyes in many instances , and would wonder whether or not his DP understood really the basic 3-point lighting set-up . While this , along with a very lackluster sound design ( or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene ) , shouldn 't be something that comes to attention during a Troma release , it should be something * basic * that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isn 't very funny or scary ( and it isn 't ) or if Lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments.It 's not a good movie by any stretch , and perhaps if you 're a vampire die-hard ( or just a vampire period ) it might have some appeal as a low-rent bargain basement alternative to Near Dark , or as a slight improvement over , say , 1972 's Blood Freak .

It now looks like a disaster area . They don 't even live there any more ... they live " " in town " " and come out only for the weekend .

" Well , if it weren 't for Ethel Waters and a 7-year-old Sammy Davis , Jr . ( here billed without the Jr . ) , Rufus Jones for President would be one of the worst representations of African-American stereotypes I 've seen from the early talkie era and wouldn 't have been worth seeing because of that . Ms. Waters is excellent here singing " " Am I Blue ? " " and " " Underneath Our Harlem Moon " " while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz prepared him for his superstar status as an adult . He 's so good tap-dancing here that for awhile I thought he was a little person with decades of experience . So if you 're willing to ignore the negative connotations here , Rufus Jones for President should provide some good enjoyment . P.S.

" " " Boom " " has garnered itself a something of a reputation . With heavyweights Taylor , Burton , Noel Coward , Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey , one might be tempted to think , how bad could it be ? Well , it 's a lot worse than you could possibly imagine.The sad and disturbing fact of " " Boom " " is that is seems to signal the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights . It was only director Joseph Losey who having plummeted the depths with " " Modesty Blaise " " and " " Boom " " ( some may wish to add " " Secret Ceremony " " ) , managed to recuperate and in 1970 create his best work , the wonderful " " Go-Between " . " Saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams . From the mid forties until the early sixties , Williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status , remaining in theater repertory throughout the world , many becoming much praised films . When William 's muse deserted him , probably owing to his notorious substance abuse , it deserted him for good . Williams at his best is an actor 's dream providing many unforgettable performances . ( Were Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in " " Night of the Iguana " " ? ) Taylor in particular , shone in both " " Cat on a Hot Tin Roof " " and " " Suddenly Last Summer " . " There is an anecdote in which supposedly Taylor asks John Gielgud whether he would teach her to play Shakespeare , to which he replied " " if you will teach me to play Tennessee Williams " . " Had Gielgud seen " " Boom " " he would have held his tongue . Taylor simply has never been worse , turning in a cringe inducing performance . Despite her face photographing well , she is decidedly podgy . Besides the physical decline , from this time onwards she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a string of completely forgettable ( and worse ) roles to her credit.Much the same could be said of Burton . Following his short lived theatrical stardom , he won fame and fortune in Hollywood . But the body of his work from this point onwards ( 1968 ) would be unremarkable to say the least.Noel Coward had long ceased being a force in the theater where his drawing room comedies had been replaced by the likes of Williams and the British " " angry young men " . " He seems to be enjoying himself camping it up , but barely manages to amuses , that from the man who claimed such a talent.The only cast member who maintains her dignity is young Joanna Shimkus , who in a few years would forego a promising screen career to become Mrs. Sidney Poitier . " " Boom " " reeks of self indulgence ; it 's simply out of control . A rather sad pointer to careers gone wrong rather than a camp fun fest as some have suggested . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Kim ( Patricia Clarkson ) , George ( Jake Weber ) and son Miles ( Erik Per Sullivan ) are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from Manhattan 's bustling metropolis . On the way , they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow . A group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along . Rather than helping , at least one of the hunters , Otis ( John Speredakos ) , is mad because the accident cracked the buck 's antlers . George , Kim and Miles are disturbed by Otis , and even worse , we quickly learn that Otis has learned where they 're staying . Meanwhile , Miles is given a wendigo ( a kind of Indian shape-shifting spirit / monster ) token by an Indian whom only he has seen . Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes ? Are there wendigos in the woods ? I can see where Wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers . It is a fairly low budget film , with technical limitations frequently showing through . Much of the film , and maybe all of it , is not really about the titular creature . And perhaps the fatal blow for many people , it has a very ambiguous ending , with a number of questions left unanswered . If you are discouraged by such endings , and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant , do yourself a favor and avoid Wendigo.Personally , I like films like that . I usually prefer some ambiguity . The marketing of Wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick , scary creature flick , where they 'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end , and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for Wendigo 2 : The Monster Returns , but that 's not what this film is . Wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people . Heck , writer / director Larry Fessenden even has a character , George , reciting Robert Frost . The Frost poem , and George 's comment that Frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things , is the key to the film.One of the best things about the film is its complexity . In a way , there are four different films occurring at the same time , a thread from each character . In George 's thread , he isn 't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world , and he has some parenting problems . For him , the film is a realistic , horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse . In Patricia 's thread , she 's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family . She 's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her , hoping that they 'll go away and get better . In Otis ' thread , he 's even more down on his luck than George , and George 's arrival into his life symbolizes the final " " crack " " in his psychological armor . And in Miles ' thread , which is probably the most important of the film , life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world . But this is a horror story , after all , albeit one with a glimmer of hope , and the events in the film give Miles ' poetic interpretations a dark turn . Still , when everything is said and done , he seems to be the only one retaining his composure , due to the poetic outlook.Even though the film is low budget , there are a lot of well-executed higher budget ambitions . Fessenden and director of photography Terry Stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations , and created some interesting slide show like montages ( such as the cards , or the Indian wendigo images from the book ) . There are also interesting more traditional montages , such as Miles ' nightmare . Wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films.Other technical aspects are good for the budget . The " " Wendigo " " appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous . The lighting was usually good--there were a few times that dark scenes weren 't as clear as they could have been , but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock ( it could have been digital instead ) or transfer . I thought the performances were good and far more realistic ( if you value that ) than the majority of films . Although I didn 't really notice the score , it must have been okay , or I would have noticed it with a negative judgment.Overall , Wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions , as long as you don 't mind having to think about the movies you watch . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I didn 't really HATE Mirrormask . I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals . The movie begins with a young girl named Helana who works in a circus . But while other children ( supposedly ) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away FROM the circus . During a heated argument with her mother , Helana wishes she would drop dead . Bad move . The mother gets ill with ... something ( presumably cancer ) and needs surgery . On the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she " " finds herself " . " Personally the movie got crap for me as soon as she started dreaming . The early scenes show the weird and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the bleakness of the hospital and the filth of an apartment block . But a soon as she dreams the whole films shifts to CGI land where nearly everything is a computer image . The problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have. while films like the Wizard of Oz seemed enticing to explore Mirrormask shoves images in our faces and then snatches them away to give us another image . There 's little rhyme or reason to the design in this film and even though some things are very pretty ( the librarian is a masterpiece ) they just disappear so quickly that they 're soon forgotten . Helana and her sidekick Valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst . Overall Mirrormask is like a pretty stake that you bite and find out is actually ash .

" I saw this director 's " " Woman On The Beach " " and could not understand the good to great reviews . This film is much like that one , two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else . Like his other films , you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog , wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten , pretty uninteresting characters . If you feel you can like this film , don 't let my review stop you . I do like minimalism in films , but I feel Tsai Ming-Liang 's films are far superior . He has a fairly terrific actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films . There is nothing here . I wish IU liked it , but I don 't . Oh , well . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Bad , bad movie . When I saw the synopsis I was expecting something like Ring only with video game instead of tape . Nothing of the sorts happened . I 'll admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not it.First of all choosing real life person , countess Bathory , is stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story . Anybody even vaguely familiar with her story would begin to wonder why and how did this Hungarian noblewoman end up in this movie . Choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much , much better.Then there is whole you-die-in-real-life-as-you-die-in-the-game concept . As I said before interesting , Ring-like story . But instead of developing it into good story line it sort of just flows along with no explanation given why did this game became such as it is , why it was created and so on . Waste of good idea.And finally this movie doesn 't even have gory of funny parts that can if not save at least make crappy horror movies watchable . Death scenes are too quick and acting is too wooden to be funny.Avoid if possible . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What 's with Indonesian musical movies ? Never have I seen Indonesian musical movies like the ones made in Bollywood . They miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of ' what they called ' poetic lines.This story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks . It 's a simple story plot ( but it 's quite focused though ) with ' meant to be ' musical story lines here and there.Confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected . The main actress may try to live up the character , but it 's the best that she could do , trying . As for the casting , I don 't feel the necessity to put a Balinese student in that story and of course , that 's not the only unnecessary characters.The strange thing is , why would I want to watch this movie ?

" Now , I 've seen a lot of bad movies . I like bad movies . Especially bad action movies . I 've seen ( and enjoyed ) all of Jean-Claude Van Damme 's movies , including the one where he 's his own clone , both of the ones where he plays twins , and all three where he 's a cyborg . I actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians . ( Hey , if nothing else , he 's got a great ass and you almost always get to see it . With DVD , you can even pause and zoom in ! ) That 's why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad , it makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane.Everything about Snake Eater is bad . The plot is bad . The script is bad . The sets are bad . The fights are bad . The stunts are bad . The FX are bad . The acting is spectacularly , earth-time-bendingly bad , very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so-called actor in the cast , including Lorenzo Lamas , and that 's really saying something . And I 'd be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed , to boot . ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas . It does manage to be unintentionally funny , so it 's not a total loss . However , I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very , very stoned .

" I looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented .

This is a Boston based college production that doesn 't even achieve the level of most amateur college film . It 's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do .

" Though it 's better than most made-for-TV movies , " " Buried Alive " " is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill revenge tale . There are so many plot holes in this one , it makes you wonder why the screenwriters didn 't go through a series of re-writes . The ending has a nice twist to it , but it 's hardly believable.The acting by Jennifer Jason Leigh is terrific , as always , but Tim Matheson hams it up with cheesy one-liners that reminds one of Jack Nicholson in " " The Shining " .

" The story and the characters really REALLY needed work . The world idea is kind of neat , but no one bothered to develop any of it either through exposition , or through the plot . Despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film , it makes sense that you wouldn 't use exposition , since no one is new to this world . And yet , when Matt Owens ( Bill Paxton ) and Byron ( Bob Peck ) stray off-course and get lost , and get introduced to the wind-worshipers and the fat , lazy , rich people in the museum , we don 't get any real idea of who these people are , or why we should care about any of them . Smart films have ways of developing this simply by having the characters live in the world . Simple things , like ordering a drink at a bar , or talking about something in the past -- these are the kind of things that make the film world memorable , not endless shots of crappy planes , and cheap CG effects of someone trying to do loops in an ultralight.If this is too difficult for you , here 's a little tip -- pare down the multiple locations . If everything 's becoming disjointed because you 're pulling up to often , stay in one place for a little while and have the characters talk a little . All the superfluous crap should be removed . Get rid of the entire wind-worshipers scene . Get rid of the stuffy museum people . Get rid of all the crappy flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story . Have the entire thing set on a big plane , or something . Just get people talking about something we care about.Hey , get rid of Bill Paxton . Have the film center around Tasker 's character and his relationship with the robot , Byron.Indeed , the biggest problem of the film is that we don 't care anything about anybody , because no one takes the time to either explain their motivations or delve into their characters . We don 't like Matt ( well , because he 's played by Bill Paxton , among other things ) . He 's a scoundrel , who doesn 't redeem himself enough , except to let the android , Byron , go . And this action has even less meaning than most because of three key points : 1 . Byron is a murderer . 2 . Byron is indestructible 3 . Byron can leave any time he damn well pleases.We try to like Byron , because there 's a kind of pathos there , but it 's largely undeveloped . All we 're left with is a whiny , glassy-eyed robot guy who 's acting is subdued and wooden one moment , and practically zany the next . We don 't know why or how he develops emotions , but we do know for a fact that he 's murdered someone . We don 't know why he murdered someone , or the circumstances of this grisly event , because it isn 't developed . We can 't feel pity for him if we don 't know the story . All we know for a fact is that he murders people . And he likes Bill Paxton.We don 't hate Tasker enough ( partly because he 's played by good-guy Mark Hamill ) , since while gruff and ruthless , doesn 't do anything out of the ordinary for his character -- a post-apocalyptic peace officer . Sure he kills Montclaire ( Robbie Coltrane ) and his team , but they are drug dealers , on their way to grow poppies for heroin . And they shoot at him first . He doesn 't kill anyone who doesn 't get in the way , or who does not try to physically harm him first . That goes equally well for the final confrontation in the museum . He uses a smidge of police brutality against a lazy dilettante ( F. Murray Abraham is wasted in this role ) , and everyone else draws a gun on him.I really don 't understand what 's the deal with Belitski ( Kitty Aldridge ) , Tasker 's partner . After only an accumulated 10 minutes with Matt , she 's ready to switch sides , despite her shouts of loyalty , and despite Matt 's trash-talking her , and punching her out . If that 's love , then I 'll choose hate any day.Really. Paxton 's character is about as lovable as Simon in " " True Lies " , " or Pvt. Hudson from " " Aliens " . " Does anyone fall for him in these movies ? No . Why ? Because he 's a loud-mouthed idiot , and a loser . Why put him at the helm of this film ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" : : : SPOILER ALERT : : : Soooo , Arnie 's really a good guy , but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders , he 's sent to jail ( or rather some sort of work camp ) . He escapes , but after a short while he 's caught once again . This time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he 's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes , and eventually die . But we all know Arnie , and we all know that he 's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys.I really wanted to like this movie , being an Arnie-fan and all . However , " " The Running Man " " contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me . E.g. The reconstruction of Arnie 's fight inside the helicopter , where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident , complete with 5-10 different camera angles . This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members , one of which _ inside _ the eye of one of the crew members Arnie beats.There are other flaws also , and the plot , which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative , works for a while , then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns.The acting can 't really be said to be anything better than sub par , with Arnie in the leading role , doing an average Arnie performance . The rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad.The special effects are OK , without being impressive.RATING : 3 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" O boy , was this really bad.I saw this on videotape.In scenes that had soundtrack music , it was hard to hear the dialog . When people were on the telephone , it was hard to hear the person on the other end . It appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used , because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits . And there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn 't seem intentional.One indicator of the budget ( one of many ) was when a news report comes on TV . There is just a " " news flash " " title card badly superimposed with a video effect onto a TV screen , and a voice-over by a newscaster . They couldn 't shoot footage of a newscaster , and then actually show it on the TV ? The movie starts off with a killer wearing surgical scrubs and mask , wielding a scalpel . Supposedly he 's a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid having a lobotomy performed on him.Students are let out of school for a break , and three young women decide to have a slumber party . Three guys decide to crash the party , and a geek named Science decides to crash it too . The slumber party is pretty boring , and the guys just keep showing up randomly wearing masks , taking the masks off , and then disappearing . The mother and father ( the surgeon who was to do the lobotomy ) of one of the girls keep showing up too . The killer knocks slices people 's throats without anyone really noticing . The apparent lead of the movie more or less sleepwalks through the movie . Perhaps that was bad acting , or maybe it was intentional , since much of the movie is a nightmare , and some of it a nightmare within a nightmare.The ending is really horrible too.The best thing about the movie is the cheesy United Home Video VHS box art , which was revived for the DVD release ( a double feature with Terror at Tenkiller ) . I honestly can 't tell if it is a photo , or a painting , or a combination of both . The women pictured on the cover are not in the movie , and the clothing they 're wearing is way more revealing than anything the women in the movie wore . The throat slicing on the cover is scarier than the ones in the movie - where people tend to affect a goofy pop-eyed look . For that matter , that 's what the killer has most of the time : head cocked , and eyes bugging out , mugging for the camera .

" " Polite chuckling.This , I like to envision , is how Jeff Lowell , the man who dreamed up " " Over Her Dead Body , " " presented his concept to the studio execs over there at New Line Cinema . The big mystery is how those very same corporate bigwigs could then turn right around and green light the project , allowing Lowell to direct the film as well as write the screenplay.For if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds , then clearly you have another think coming . The only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a no-holds-barred satirical farce . Instead , wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy , inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy , Lowell engages in boring half-measures every step of the way , tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality . Indeed , " " Over Her Dead Body " " is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it 's hard to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with it . Virtually every set-up , joke and sight gag in the film is flat-footed and poorly executed , with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament . How else to explain the halfhearted , lifeless performances of Paul Rudd , Eva Langoria Parker , Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles ? I choose not to blame the actors , some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past ( that is particularly the case with Rudd ) . But Lowell and those studio execs sure have some ' splainin ' to do . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie has good intentions , at least in the message " " don 't be afraid , no matter how tough it can be . Fear will kill you in the end " " It 's a good message , but the container is so flawed that the message gets squashed by bad acting , complete lack of credibility in the feelings , dialog that 's delivered as if it were read out loud , stereotypes instead of breathing , living people.It abuses from effects such as slow-motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the acting and thus , a lack of emotional force ... The suicidal part of it still reminds me of a low-budget film from the pre-90s , when lesbians seemed to have ( at least on celluloid ) an utter incapacity of live good , happy lives , and a tendency to get caught in over-the-top dramas that often involved separation , death , or prison . Had it focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel it ( and not according to how others think we should live it ) , it would have being less dramatic , more inspiring . But it doesn 't , it focuses of pain , on loss and leaves the message at just a theoretical ideal.I can 't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection . If you 're looking for a really good movie that talks about overcoming fear and daring to live what you feel , go back to the magnificent " " Desert Hearts " " ( even better : read the novel ! ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I gave 1 to this film . I can 't understand how Ettore Scola , one of the greater directors of Italian cinema , made a film like this , so stupid and ridiculous !

The only things I save in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann . Hope that Scola will change radically themes and style in his next film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hitting the ground running , the film begins with THREE murders in a row . No plot , no characters , no motivation ; the second murder happens off screen , and that victim 's severed head is actually used to quite efficiently bludgeon the third victim to death ! This is a high point . But the Lewises are obviously smart enough to lead with strength ; soon they 're covering up botched dialogue scenes with detective voice-over and shooting endless snappy repartee in ugly wide shot . By now this Betacam production 's horror atmosphere is rapidly giving way to an insurance infomercial vibe , with the monumental ( and rather endearing ) plainness of the leads skewing things further in that direction . Shlub cop investigates , meat cleaver guy slaughters , repeat , climaxing early with a memorable severed-finger-in-the-salad gag . Only , how the hell did the fingers get in the salad ? And wasn 't the Blood Cult 's purpose to collect the appendages they severed ? When the GORE stops making sense , you know you 're in trouble . And without spoiling the big , nonsensical twist ending , just take my word for it : the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep cathode-tube-smashing impulse .

" Seriously , there is absolutely NOTHING good about this crap fest at all . Randolph Scott , a closet homosexual who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years , is at his most wooden and boring in the least role . At 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles , although it doesn 't matter so much here because Gail Russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking . Lee Marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isn 't enough to save this garbage .

" This film concerns purportedly non-establishment types ( aesthetically and sexually ) who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs . Although some excellent players take part , including Jon Tenney , Timothy Olyphant , and Cynthia Nixon , they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue ; which isn 't . Nixon 's role possesses the best lines , but she often homes in on them too quickly , a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director . The grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche , spent or not , and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" With the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with HB Warner on the celestial train , this was 94 minutes of jaw-dropping horribleness ! The acting was atrocious , but the story is what I really found appalling . The acting was wooden and stilted , even by early talkies standards ( the exceptions being Lee Tracy and HB Warner , neither of whom can do wrong ) . Rose Hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as Julie ( as she likewise was in 1932 's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde , an otherwise excellent flick ) . And the rest of the cast was worse , there being no words to describe their awfulness . Worse than the acting , however , was the story . For some unknown reason , Julie loves Liliom , a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever . He marries Julie but doesn 't support her , instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low-life criminal pal ( Lee Tracy ) . And , oh yeah , he never has a kind word to say to Julie and he regularly beats her . Julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him , which only seems to make him more abusive . What 's even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story . Somehow we are supposed to see Julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems Liliom . WTF ? The last 1 / 3 of this movie takes place after Liliom has killed himself ( a robbery plot goes awry and Liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police ) . As he lay dying , he tells Julie " " I beat you all the time , but I 'm not sorry for it . " " When he at last dies , she finally tells him she loves him . ( Neither character ever said " " I love you " " to the other while they were alive . ) After his death , God 's Chief Magistrate gives Liliom one more day on earth so that he can " " do something good " " for his unborn daughter . The price for this is 10 years in hell . After 10 years , Liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10-yr-old daughter . He approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him " " do something good " " for her ; he tries to get her to play cards , he tries to give her Gabriel 's horn , but she 's not interested and rebuffs him . So he slaps her . He . Slaps . Her . And then he disappears back to the afterlife . Looking on , we see his daughter tell Julie about this . The girl says the slap didn 't hurt , that it felt like a kiss . This is supposed to be the movie 's magical moment . The girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible , and Julie replies that " " someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all . " " Then the music swells and Liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train . BLECH ! There was one saving grace to this film , and that is the interview between the Chief Magistrate ( HB Warner was truly magnificent here ) and Liliom on the celestial train . The Magistrate had some very profound things to say to Liliom about life and second chances and death . This scene alone made me bump this rating from 1 to 2 stars . Regarding Liliom 's suicide as a means for escaping his problems , the Magistrate says " " People suppose that when they die , their difficulties are ended for them . You thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities . It is not as simple as that . On Earth your name is still spoken ; your face is still remembered . As long as one is left who remembers you , so long is the matter unended . Until you have been completely forgotten , you will not be finished with the Earth , even though you are dead .

" WEll first and for most I 'd just like to say that I 'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies . Only the movie in titled " " Scarecrow gone wild " " could bring me back , so here I am.With that being said , I like to start off with this comment . OUCH ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This movie was really horrible , I mean I know it was going to be bad . But I had no idea that I would be spending 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute film laughing at what I thought was a horror movie.Let 's start with the biggest flaw of the film ( to me that is ) . Ken Shamrock . Now if memory serves me correctly , Shamrock is one of the worlds most dangerous men . Now if memory serves me again , he was also in this stupid movie being a stupid comic relief ( or that 's how it looked to me ) . I mean how else do you explain all of his lines . My all time favorite line of his in this so called movie was " " It 's been a long time coming " . " OK ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? The funnest thing about that line was that no more then five minutes prior to him say that , he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon to be dead kids about how the dam scarecrow could not be killed . So if he has knowledge of this , why on earth would he start trying to combat it as soon as he sees it ( the scarecrow that it ) . Like I said before , he must have been the comic relief , except I don 't think his UFC buddies where laughing.Now that I 've finished that well deserved paragraph on to the movie.I 'll admit that I can 't remember a lot of scenes , and that 's not good considering that I just watch the movie no more then fifteen minutes ago . So what I 'm going to do is list the top five things wrong with this film 1 . Usually when horror movie monster have their own theme music , it 's not heard by the victims or even by the monster itself . So why were just about every person involved in this movie able to here this pathetic whistling . I mean I saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.2. Why on earth were there murders on a beach . I 'm sorry , but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings . But I guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that . Plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room . I mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach , it looked as if they were running in the same spot.3. The girl running in the gray sweat pants . That really bother during the duration of this film . I mean she looks so ridiculous . Plus it didn 't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group . I mean what was she like twelve or something . There no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera . I mean doesn 't the camera add like ten pounds or something , so what was her excuse.4. People trying to get record deals on camera . Just when I thought that this movie could not get any cheesier , out comes the wanna be Gorth Brooks and oh man was he lame . I don 't ' remember the whole scene , but from what I do remember it was not pretty . This one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing , and I mean nothing to do with what 's going on in the film . The funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this . I mean the only person who doesn 't really know how to response to this is the " " token black guy " . " And that 's sad because if I 'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of American Idoal . But here 's where it gets funny . While this guy is all into his new song or whatever . In the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow . And boy does he look pi * * ed off at this . I mean there 's actually a moment where he looks like he 's really jealous of this guy . So what does he do about this jealousy , well I 'm glad you ask . He wait 's for the guy to finish his song , and then he finises the guy . I don 't want to give the death scene away , but I can tell you this . If that scene doesn 't make you laugh , then nothing on this earth will.5. This movie was way longer then I expected . And it didn 't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls * * t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film . I mean I 'll admit , I didn 't see the twist coming , but that had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping that the film was over and done with . But no they had to do they twist s * * t . Needless to say that when I say that coming , I just turned off the T.V. and said f * * k it , there 's no way that movie could have gotten any worser . Thanks to my rather fast judgment I can say that I 'll never know what was to happen next . But I promise that I do not care ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! All and all the movie is good for a laugh , but please don 't buy it . Just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I discovered " " The Patriot " " in a DVD-store and thought it could be a real action thriller . No , it쨈s instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story . It쨈s no doubt a cable-movie and not one for the theatre . Fortunately after 90 minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an anti-virus against sleep . One thing came over : it was the nice country the film has been shot . You can really feel the American air but that쨈s all . I hope for Steven Seagal that he finally succeeds in a big hit .

" Retro Puppet Master starts in Kolewige during 1944 where puppet master Andre Toulon ( Guy Rolfe ) & his living puppets plan to escape Germany , hold up in an Inn puppet master Toulon reminisces about his early life & the point at which he learned the secret of giving life to dead objects way back in 1902 in Paris when his younger self ( Greg Sestero ) ran the Theate Magique . He describes the fateful night when he met a 3000 year old Egyptian sorcerer named Afzel ( Jack Donner ) & the eventual love of hi life the young & beautiful Ilsa ( Brigitta Dau ) . He tells the story of how Afzel passed the gift of life to himself & gave life to his own wooden puppets that were part of the Theatre Magique show . However the gift of life was also a curse as the ancient God Sutek whom the secret was stolen from in the first place by Afzel wants it back & everyone who has learnt it dead ... As of late I have been on a bit of a Puppet Master bender as being a big fan of the first three I decided to watch the rest of the franchise & as such I have seen Puppet Master 4 ( 1993 ) , Puppet Master 5 : The Final Chapter ( 1994 ) , Curse of the Puppet Master ( 1998 ) & now Retro Puppet Master in the space of a couple of weeks & boy was it tough to get through them all , especially this one as it 's the worse of the series so far . Retro Puppet Master feels like a cross between Puppet Master III : Toulon 's Revenge ( 1991 ) with it 's period setting & Puppet Master 4 & Puppet Master 5 : The Final Chapter with Sutek trying to kill everyone associated with his stolen life giving secret . There 's not much continuity here either , again there 's none of the green serum featured in the earlier films & despite Andre Toulon committing suicide in 1939 at the start of the original Puppetmaster ( 1989 ) he is seen alive & well during 1944 in this . The majority of the story is told as a flashback & concentrates on Andre Toulon himself rather than the puppets , the film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa & him learning the secret of life & it 's all rather dull & tedious stuff to be honest . Even at only 80 odd minutes Retro Puppet Master feels long & padded with no real pace & the no central concept as the plot never really settles down & generally hops around a lot . Then of course there 's the baffling decision to totally redesign the puppets which I found incredible , I mean why would the makers take the one basic thing that made the Puppet Master films so memorable & completely do away with it ? The puppets are seen briefly at the start & the end but otherwise we get these rubbishy looking wooden caricatures that are nowhere near as cool as their modern re-workings . It 's never even explained why these puppets were used rather than the ones all Puppet Master fans have come to love although one suspects that Full Moon was hoping to make yet another sequel which dealt with that very question.If a poor story & a complete lack of our favourite puppets wasn 't bad enough Full Moon decided to go with a PG-13 rating for this making Retro Puppet Master the only Puppet Master film not rated ' R ' in the US ( obviously other countries have their own film ratings systems ) & therefore there 's not a single drop of blood in the entire film , the puppets don 't kill anyone , there 's no swearing & no nudity either . This is tamer than tame kids stuff all the way . Besides the puppets themselves being rubbish the special effect are the wost of the series too , there 's no stop motion animation at all in this one , no CGI computer effects ( surely in 1999 CGI was cheap enough ? ) & all the effects are of the stiff rod puppet type effects . I mean whenever you see a puppet ' walk ' the camera is always positioned above it 's wait so it 's legs don 't have to be shown & there 's obviously some production assistant just pushing the thing along , that 's as complex & state of the art as the special effects get.The one positive thing that Retro Puppet Master does have going for it is that it looks rather nice , the period production design , costumes & props are actually quite impressive & it 's a fairly handsome film to watch at times . Apparently filmed in Bucharest in Romania which doubles up quite nicely for turn of the last century Paris . The acting here is awful & maybe the worst of the series.Retro Puppet Master is more or less the final Puppet Master film as the next one Puppet Master : The Legacy ( 2004 ) basically edits together footage from the previous seven films & it 's a pretty crappy way to round the series off which started so well with three excellent & distinctive little killer puppet flicks . Don 't bother with this , just watch one of the first three again & just remember the good times ... The killer puppets would return in the terrible spin-off flick Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys ( 2004 ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that Albert Pyun made in 1993 - and it 's the bad one . Apparently all his energy went into " " Nemesis " " which was an entertaining non-stop action movie , and had a much more expensive look . " " Knights " " is clunky and cheesy , a bottom-of-the-barrel sci-fi that too often resembles a video game ( new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible ) . The only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is Kathy Long ; not a particularly attractive woman , but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine .

Some are actually funny such as the first scary movie . This was one of many that have been made as of late that are not . The humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull.I feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as Varsity Blues , Friday Night Lights , Stick it , etc .

" Sean Bean is great , as are the photography , locations and costumes . However , the plot is somewhat muddled , and the conclusion flat . The plot has been SUBSTANTIALLY altered from Cornwell 's novel , and not to the better . Unfortunately , this adventure is much better read than watched . Sharpe was too narrowly drawn here , in contrast with his literary alter ego , who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks . I really enjoyed the brief scene in which Sharpe is tripped by a " " real " " officer , and after a quick pause and piercing stare , pushes the surprised and cowed officer right back . It sets the tone for his later trials as a commanding officer.Rating : " " 4 " " of " " 10 . " " , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Leave it to Paul " " sex on the brain " " Verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the INVISIBLE MAN story . If he 'd direct a Pokemon film , I 'm sure he 'd turn it into some massive orgy of sorts . I don 't mind sex or even sleaze ( check my other reviews ) on film but frankly , it 's obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn 't see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it . It 's a shame because it could have been good if the film didn 't spend so much time having an invisible Kevin Bacon grope women . The game cast of actors does what it can with the one-note cheesy script but I felt bad for some of them , including William Devane , who is totally wasted here.But then what could I have expected from the director of SHOWGIRLS , which , btw , is much more entertaining than this stilted & bad film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Medoly is kept from the sea until Morgana is captured , but she doesn 't know a thing about it , because it all happened when she was a baby . A wall surrounds the palace to keep her in and morgana out . She goes under the wall day to day to have a swim and talk with Sebastian , who is not as funny or fun as in the original . She finds a seashell with her name on it and runs away from home and to look for answers and finds Morgana . Here is a similarity ; Morgana tricks Melody , making her happy by turning here into a mermaid . Meanwhile , Eric , Melody and King Triton look for her . To stay a mermaid she needs to steal the trident from Triton . So Melody does , because she does not know King Triton is her father . She makes friends with a penguin and a walrus and here is where it is awful . The penguins who live with them in an icy ocean , hate them because they are cowards . So they try to prove they are heroes and fail . That does not suit the little mermaid . And the dialogue during those conversations between the penguins and those two characters is ear-bleeding. you know why ? Because the first had a great story . This one is not and is not magical . It is just an example of how bad many sequels are.Melody finds them and they help to take her to Atlantica to prove themselves . When they take the trident , Ariel finds Melody with Morgana . Melody is angry at her mother for keeping her from the sea so she gives the trident to Morgana , then she shows her true colours once she grabs it . Poor Ariel and Melody are in her custody . The penguin and the walrus begin to prove themselves when they fight Morgana 's shark friend . Sorry I did not mention him earlier . They finally prove themselves . Eric , King Triton and his soldiers arrive but are forced to bow down before Morgana by the power of the trident . Melody takes it , throws it to Triton and he ices Morgana ( literally ) . Then Ariel apologises to Melody and thinks it is all her fault . It was not ! Ariel did the right thing to protect Melody , but they never say so . Triton offers Melody to live in sea or land . She in fact has a " " better idea " . " She uses the trident to vaporize the wall so humans and mer-folk can be together . Then everyone sings an awful song . THE END.Whoever has seen it and likes this obviously has not seen the original . I do not dislike this because I am a teenager . I liked it when I was very very little . Then as I grew older I began to see what is bad about this film. young , young kids will enjoy it , but it is likely that when they are in primary school , they will forget about it . Normally I would think I over-judged a film and it was better than I remember when I watched it again , but not this one . It is even worse . Story is no exception . If you thought , by reading this that the story is good , read more of this comment and you will know the other bad points : Well , you know the story now . I am sorry for spoiling it for you , but I had to point out some bad parts of it . One of the worst things is the animation . Colour is awful . The original had beautiful colour . Watching this almost made me want to go blind . Even the illustrations and landscape design were not good . The original had beautiful , magical colouring and beautiful underwater landscape design and for land as well , making it a joy to watch.The music is unbearable . Compared to the first , the music here is crap . Songs are not that well composed and Tara Strong ( I think that is her name ) who did Melody can not sing . She at times either sang too high or did not keep track for the melody in the song . So much for having " " Melody " " as a name.And the music is not at all beautiful or moving . Little Mermaid 1 won an Oscar for it and it truly deserved it . This one deserved a razzie award for worst musical score in a sequel if it would exist.I did not like the voices . Several people who played characters from the first , did the same ones in this . Jodi Benson is a great singer , but now that she is older , no offence to her , her voice is too deep and not so beautiful anymore . And I am really disappointed in her and others who were in the first for being a part of this . If I was chosen for this film , just by reading the script , I can tell it would be a bad film . The characters are different now . Ariel is more wiser now , but annoying . They overdid her character , making her too mature . In sequels you are not meant to change the characters unless it is for a special reason . She was sixteen in the first . There is little chance she changes . That is the stage when you become the person you are going to be for the rest of your life . Screenwriters should think of that . They should think of the character.Well , I suppose that is it for me . I hope you find my comment useful , because I am sure a lot of you will agree with my point of view . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the sorriest collection of clich챕s , strung together on a straight line , with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting I 've seen in a long time . Canibalising scenes from Star Wars , Reign of Fire , Godzilla , Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter , it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence . Was this movie good ? It wasn 't a movie at all ! Even if it doesn 't go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy , the movie does offer some laughs . The trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films . Gandalf can be funny talking Korean , the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between Sauron and Jaja-bing , or whatever his name was.Bottom line : any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers , not on the director / writer .

" How can a movie with Amy , Posey and Raechel have NOTHING funny in it ? Believe it or not ' House Bunny ' did this better and funnier . Hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money - this movie is an embarrassment to all of them . It is a clich챕 from beginning to end . Clich챕s can work well with a script , or at least an idea . This movie does nothing but use clich챕 after clich챕 rather than ideas or script . It uses the preexisting persona 's of the actresses rather than develop characters . Bad , sad , and rubbish . Now I apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment . Really ? Why ?

" This is the story of a maniac cop who , for some reason , has it in for a young college stud and his mates . After they report him to his supervisor who in turns suspends him pending psychiatric evaluation , he finds an opportunity to psychology torture them when , on a bet , the kids hack into a department store 's security and unlock the door . Only , they get locked in the store , along with the weirdo . Murder and mayhem are afoot , and the kids are running around trying to survive until morning when they may be able to escape . ' Dangerous Game ' would have been a successful cat-and-mouse psycho thriller probably if it was set in a different location . The thought of psychotic cop chasing around a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn 't work . Especially when he comes face-to-face with his flinching prey quite frequently and yet , does nothing serious quite often . There was no real confrontation as would be sufficient for this kind of story , and may 've worked better if say , for example , the teens were loose in the neighborhood and left to fend for themselves against this weirdo ( especially if that took a few days while he makes them increasingly paranoid ... although granted , even that is clich챕d ) .What a shame , too , that it could not have been a better thriller , considering a funky cast of young Australian characters . Even a light hearted adventure despite the madness of the villain interspersed through the picture might have even made it a more satisfying picture . Instead , it started out fresh , and sure did have plenty of action sequences , but wound up verging on the ridiculous . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Orson Welles ' 1974 documentary " " F for Fake " " examines trickery and fraud , mainly focusing on two men who have been exposed as frauds themselves . Clifford Irving is a biographer who wrote the allegedly fraudulent Howard Hughes autobiography , yet , at least it seems , purports his innocence . The other main subject of the film is artist Elmyr de Hory , a man who has spent his life painting fakes of famous masterpieces , sometimes selling them to museums as real works by the original artists . Interspersed among these stories are bits where Welles does magic tricks to illustrate points , etc . , and he also addresses the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first lied on his resume and then created a radio sensation with " " War of the Worlds " . " I really wanted to love this film and find it profound since I am such a Welles devotee , but I couldn 't bring myself to do it . Part of the problem lied with the fact that it was not just non-linear , it was completely scattered . While I appreciate stylish editing and quick jumps and zooms , particularly when used in an unusual format such as a documentary , there was simply too much of it going on in " " F for Fake " . " They created a distraction as opposed to lending style . If the story had been more clear and comprehensive , I think that the editing probably would not have been as annoying . The scattered storytelling was made all the more obnoxious by the fact that these were truly interesting subjects , particularly Elmyr de Hory . His artistic fakery brings up the topic of fraud in the art world , and who is truly able to determine the authenticity of certain works ; and if the works are not authentic , what does it say about those who admire the pieces in museums ? This is one documentary that I would say to at least give a shot , but don 't be afraid to turn it off if you 're not enjoying it . It is certainly the most discombobulated documentary I have ever seen ; it is a cross between a documentary , an art film and experimental film , none of which is properly represented or isolated . I don 't have any lesser opinion of Welles after seeing it , but it certainly , in my opinion , doesn 't stand out as a glowing specimen in his oeuvre . 4 / 10 --Shelly , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yet another Lo Wei production to completely waste the talents of a young Jackie Chan , To Kill With Intrigue is a strange mix of wuxia , melodrama , supernatural action , and plain old-school kung fu fighting that is pretty dull despite featuring several surreal WTF moments and lots of laughably bad dialogue.In an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin from the Killer Bees , a gang of ruthless killers that are about to attack his home , Cao Lei ( Jackie Chan ) pretends to be a heartless cad , driving her away , and thus saving her from danger.During the attack , Cao 's relatives are all killed , but he is left relatively unharmed by the gang , whose leader , a scar-faced woman , seems to have the hots for him . Cao then goes in search of Chin Chin , whose safety he has entrusted to his close friend Chu Chuk.During his quest to find his true love , Cao befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil ' Bloody Rain ' clan . Eventually , after being injured in a fight against members of the nasty clan ( a fun scene with lots of silly weaponry ) , and then nursed back to health by the scar-faced Killer Bee ( who shows her love by burning his face ! ) , Cao ultimately learns that he is a lousy judge of character : his friend , Chu Chuk , is none other than the power hungry head honcho of the ' Bloody Rain ' clan , who has plans to marry Chin Chin himself.Cue the drawn out climactic battle , with Cao getting kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually choking his traitorous ex-pal to death with a scarf.Even die hard Chan fans will find this one a chore to sit through , with only the final fight managing to showcase some of the star 's amazing acrobatic abilities . Fans of general Asian weirdness might dig the spooky appearance of the Killer Bees at the beginning of the film ( with one character inexplicably demanding back his severed hand ! ) , or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero , but , for most , this film will have very limited appeal . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Why were there so many people crowding into an evening showing of Roberto Moreira 's " " Up Against Them All " " ( " " Contra Todos " " ) at the San Francisco Film Festival ? " " It 's about a hit man , " " my friend said . " " Well . . . and it 's Brazilian , " " I added . Beautiful multicolored people , tropical weather , lush rhythms , and a hip gangster plot ? Ample enticements no doubt.Somebody forgot to tell us one little detail : this is a very bad movie , really pretty horrible , and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly made.So how on earth did " " Contra Todos " " get to make the rounds of Berlin , Melbourne , London , Manila , Stockholm , Cairo , Chicago , numerous smaller local festivals , and now San Francisco ? Apparently , because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work.First of all , it won first prize at the Rio Film Festival where it was called the best Brazilian movie of the year . It must have been a bad year ; they 've had much , much better ones . Next , snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and -- since the movie isn 't featured anywhere and so avoids close scrutiny by critics -- it keeps going the rounds.Festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot . A Chicago Festival one called " " Contra Todos " " " " a speedball cocktail shot straight out of Brazil " " and referred to Claudia 's s boyfriend as the " " stud of the slum-like neighborhood . " " Soninha is " " Teodoro 's nymph-like teen-aged daughter of burgeoning sexuality . " " The movie is " " shot with the urgency of a frequently hand-held camera " " and the director " " works up a genuine and palpable sense of frustration borne from domestic desperation and decay . " " The effect is " " unbearably raw and honest , " " and the movie hurtles " " toward a conclusion as dead-ended as the lives on display . " " Not the best writing , but it sure pumps up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewer . " " Contra Todos " " does concern a hit man , two hit men actually , and a wife and daughter and a born-again Christian girlfriend . It 's shot -- in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera-work -- mostly in a barren-looking poor suburb rather than in one of the teeming " " favelas " " or village-like Brazilian city slums where such wonderful films as " " Black Orpheus " , " " " Pixote , " " and " " City of God " " were made , and not in Rio this time , but S찾o Paulo.The hit man with family problems is Teodoro ( Giulio Lopez ) and his partner with a drug problem is Waldomiro ( Ailtan Gra챌a ) . Both actors have a little TV experience as does the actress who plays Teodoro 's sluttish blonde wife Cl찼udia ( Leona Cavalli ) and Silvia Loren챌o who plays his pouting , ready-to-revolt daughter Soninha . These actors might make it through the back corners of a few telenovelas . Who knows ? -- in a better directed film they might even be good . Aside from them there are some young men who get bumped off by Teordoro or , when he 's busy , gangs of thugs . The principals don 't work up much presence , even though the camera magnifies their pores.A couple of observers , one at the Berlin Festival and one at London 's , did see this movie 's failings but alas they 're buried in the Web hinterlands . Henry Sheehan noted from Berlin that the " " film " " ( his quotes ) was " " the worst of the video works " " shown . " " The filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film , " " Sheehan wrote , " " and hasn 't made any creative use of the new medium " " -- nor , he adds , done anything else creative.Sheehan pointed out the movie 's first big mistake : it " " starts off as a domestic drama that 's supposed to ratchet up when , half an hour into the action , Moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men . Waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie ; it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is , at the very least , a waste of time . But ratcheting up is all Moreira ever does , like a little kid who 's gotten a tool kit for his birthday , and goes around banging everything in sight without rhyme , reason or skill . " " Devastating , but true.Writing about the 2004 London festival for Kamera.com , Metin Alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances " " easily the film 's best feature . " " Yes , very easily , given that everything else is so bad . Alsanjak admitted that " " this low-budget , violent and seedy account of the lawless in Sao Paulo is devoid of any likable characters , and as a result , of hope . Too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition , the film is not helped by poor subtitling .. . " " Alsanjak 's connecting Contra Todos to " " Dogme " " and Mike Leigh didn 't help matters.Apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence -- which , when they come , are just " " banging everything in sight without rhyme , reason or skill " " -- Moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it , followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married . No doubt the director wanted to exhibit the " " banality of evil " " of low-level hit men in working class neighborhoods , but he can 't make the characters , which he sees generically , come alive for us . And the structure of the film shows that he also can 't edit his material . ( Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28 , 2005 . ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ALMOST GOLDEN : THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORYAspect ratio : 1.33 : 1Sound format : StereoBland , soap-opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of America 's first female TV news anchor .

" Definitely , definitely the worst film I 've ever seen , no questions asked ! Contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others , since it 's an independent , low-budget film , but c 'mon already 혯 the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying.Agreeing with everything that has been said about this film , for example the mind numbingly weak acting ( when it 's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene , god damn it ) , the thing I found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script , assuming such a thing existed during the production . There was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers , the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains - five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath 혯 gang up on her , why don 't you ? The only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it - which is , as the rest of the film , a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully.혚oh and by the way , this movie is NOTHING like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand-held camera 혯 this is an effect and not a trait ! Used cleverly it can be breathtaking , but in this case it 's an excuse for inadequate cinematography . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was staying in one night and got extremely bored around 2 : 00 a.m. so I flipped aimlessly through the channels and happened upon H.B.O. where this " " classic " " was playing . Initially I was happy to have caught something at the beginning , but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie . The whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females , four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle 's diner , and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner . There are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting , but certainly not worth watching . Basically , if you have nothing to do some night or just can 't sleep medication works much better . However guys there is a lot of skin so it may be okay to watch with no sound , but even that can get annoying , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Telly Savalas hams it up as the Mexican revolutionary ( though he 's matched by Chuck Connors as a military martinet ) in this jokey yet rather boring pastiche on the famous historical figure 's life and times . An earlier attempt , VILLA RIDES ! ( 1968 ) with Yul Brynner in the role and co-starring Robert Mitchcum , dealt with these events more soberly and on a grander scale . As such , PANCHO VILLA is an all-too typical European venture and an undistinguished one at that , despite its credentials ; the end result is more often silly rather than amusing - though a few moments , most notably the action set-pieces and a scene involving a brawl inside a church , offer some mild pleasure . Oh , and Savalas even gets to sing over the end titles ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The films of UPA are surprisingly well rated on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality is light-years behind that of Looney Toons , Disney and MGM at their prime . Sadly , due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame-rates and lovely backgrounds , the UPA style ( which debuted about 1950 ) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s . After all , the films were dirt cheap to make and they 'd received several Oscars to " " prove " " that the cartoons were now mainstream . So as a result , lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasn 't reversed until the 1980s.This UPA film is one of the early ones . The characters are very simply drawn ( any simpler and they would have used stick figures ) and the backgrounds were ugly--simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap-dash manner ( often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items ) .As for the story , it 's a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude . Some will love this , others will just find it very , very loud . It 's the traditional " " Frankie and Johnny " " story and because of the shootings and all , it 's probably not a great film for the kids . Heck , because of the animation and jazz , it 's not a particularly good film for me , either ! Some will read my review and no doubt think I am a crank ( which I am , to a degree ) . However , I love animated films and a little of this minimalistic UPA style goes a very , very long way and you can 't seriously consider them great works of art--just very , very quickly made cartoons . Ignore the Oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something--anything else ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yawn , that is my reaction to this film . I was really hoping this would have been a good modern day slasher but it doesn 't even fall into the category of slashers . Instead , it tries to be something it isn 't , which is a psychological thriller , and it fails so miserably at this . Even the title " " Freak " " suggests that this might be interesting . Match this with the cover art on the DVD and you think " " OK , maybe I will give this one a try " . " Not worth the time.The story actually starts up a bit interesting with a poor deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head being chained up by his fat Mother . She yells at him and probably beats him since in one scene we see her actually slap him for no reason . After all this , he decides he has had enough and smashes her face in with ( I believe ) a rock . Present day , he is now in insane asylum and is being transfered . On his way he breaks out of the van he is in and escapes . Introduce also the 2 leads characters , a little girl and her older sister . They are moving and hit the road . So most of the movie is them riding around in the car talking amongst themselves . But , the bandaged " " Freak " " is now on the loose and is about go on a rampage of grueling murder ! ( This is me being totally sarcastic ) I can 't believe how boring this movie turned out to be . The budget was on the smallest ever with absolutely no special effects and the dialog I could just care less about . This is one of those movie where the packaging is better then the flick itself . And to compare this to Halloween ? ! Rubbish ! I am not even a fan of the the Halloween series ( except the 3rd one ) but Halloween is far superior than this . At least with Halloween we have a great score and some genuinely creepy moments . With this , there is virtually no music except some piano here and there and there is nothing creepy about this movie . Maybe this movie would have fared better if it had a solid score because even the worst of movies are tolerable if the music is good.Well , that is just my opinion on the movie . I thought it was just a complete waist of time and money . But , since the movie has over a 4 / 10 rating on IMDb , there must be people that like this movie . I am not one of those people . 2 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For a movie that was the most seen in its native South Korea for most of 2004 , it was a huge disappointment . Shows that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make over-emotional , melodramatic movies . The film was over 130 minutes long but not a lot actually happened and everything that happened was pretty much what one expected , the plot was that transparent . Granted if one himself was Korean , one would perhaps get into it more , but for me it didn 't do much anything . Suffice to say that as the case tends to be with Korean cinema , the plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula . South Korea decides to recruit and train an elite assassination squad from death-sentence prisoners to kill Kim Il-Sung.A tedious plot doesn 't bother me much if the characters are good but unfortunately that is not the case this time around either . They are stereotypes and most of the acting is mediocre and too often just over the top as it tends to be in Korean cinema . Too much time is spent on the numerous montages and the characters remain distant , one dimensional cardboard cuts . They should 've spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how tough and cruel the training and the soldiers are.One thing it does remind us of , is that a lesser of two wrongs is still wrong . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is like the material S.E. Hinton was writing in the 1970s and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s , and , had Trueblood actually been a product of either , the results might 've been much better ( especially in the acting department ) . Instead , we get a rather so-bad-its-funny piece of mediocrity.Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood , a former street rumbler , I suppose is the accurate description . This was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid30s and dressed them up in greaser threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy 80s music . Nonetheless , Ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother , Donny ( Chad Lowe in a part where he screams a lot ) , who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when , on the run from the cops , he is nabbed and forced to serve time in the Marines . Flash forward to present day and Ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs , although in a gang that was Ray 's adversary and now old scores must be violently settled ( and again , cops must be dodged and this time , a lady 's honor defended in the action film sense ) before Ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother , Donny.For the most part , the film is quite ridiculous . For me , most of this has to do with far too much overacting , although not by Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn who plays the waitress he befriends . The guys in the gang and Lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as New York street toughs . Although , the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For the first fifteen minutes the story of NAKED FAME is interesting : two late thirties male porn stars in a seemingly healthy relationship decide to leave the Porn industry and try for the world of singing and acting . The two very buff and preening men are Colton Ford and Blake Harper . With the aid of Kevin Aviance and Marc Berkely , Colton makes a dance track that is then marketed in New York with the hopes that Colton Ford will become an instant star - a unique disco singer touting his background as a Porn Star for PR.The remainder of the film is grumbling and in-fighting and commentary by Porn Producer ChiChi LaRue and the film slowly sinks into repetition and doldrums . Not a bad idea for a film if there were a bit more depth revealed in each character 's drive to move away form a successful career ( though one greatly influenced by the youth both characters have lost ) into an alternative one . It is just that a one-note song wears thin quickly . Grady Harp , November 05 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

What a shame that Alan Clarke has to be associated with this tripe . That doesn 't rule it out however ; get a group of lads and some Stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter . Great wasted night stuff . Al Hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s- that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself- often with respectable jobs ( estate agent ? ? ? ) . But how Clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors straying from other TV productions of low quality ( Grange Hill ) or soon to go on to poor quality drama ( Eastenders ) can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable . Are we really to believe that the ICF ( on whom of course the drama is based ) would EVER go to another town to fight with just SIX blokes ? The ICF would crowd out tube stations and the like with HUNDREDS . Andy Nicholls ' Scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature . The acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs- Oldman is so camp it is unbelievable . Most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of Mr Matey .

" Elizabeth Taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying , untalented self in this film . This was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy .

The whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long . The actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up .

She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over-glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror , with the contrived use of a 3D ending . Aren 't those glasses nifty ? And you get to KEEP them ! It 's the equivalent of , you just spent $ 9.00 making me rich . Here 's 10 cents . Now , don 't you feel special ! ? Sorry , but for me , it just did not make me feel special . And Freddy 's had yet another face-lift . This one was for the worst , I think . All the beautiful artistry that went into his " " look " " in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper , less detailed set of prosthetics . He looks ... less like the burn victim he is supposed to be , and more like he has a skin disorder . Changing the lead 's makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor . But wait ! They 've done that , and done that . So I guess it doesn 't matter . But it mattered to me . Freddy is no longer SCARY . He 's just ... another low-rent monster like the Leprechaun . It 's more ... a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises ; riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one-liners and clever repartee ( sadly , it fell short on both accounts ) . So there 's nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh , because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film . It rates a 3.2 / 10 from ... the Fiend : . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " The 40 Year Old Virgin " " exists in a world I don 't understand . A world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to " " f * * * off " " and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded . A world where it 's really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples ' cars . A world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings . A world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities . And a world without any funny jokes ! I am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie . I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very funny to begin with , and stretched out beyond all rational thought . The chest-waxing scene went on FOREVER.The characters , aside from Carell , were totally one-note . And the romantic elements were completely contrived , particularly the scene where Keener finds porn in Carell 's apartment . That was just lame.And I also found the " " Aquarius " " sequence totally annoying and excessive . I hated hated hated this movie ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan , I found this film to be beyond awful . It was a huge disappointment since it was featured as one of the eight Horrorfest films . I can only hope the other seven were better . I was actually embarrassed for the friends I was able to convince to see this , and these are the same friends I made watch the remake of The Wicker Man . It has every clich챕 in the book . In fact , it went out of its way to include them . Let 's start with the characters . Instead of one young damsel in distress , we get three : the single , hot mom with two daughters혯 a blossoming yet brainless teenager and a cute yet simultaneously creepy little girl that you just know is going to have ' special ' skills including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead . The little girl is the same one that was in the remake of The Amityville Horror . She was a little annoying but not nearly as irritating Dakota Fanning.Overall , these characters seemed like escapees from a LifeTime movie . I thought perhaps horror movies had moved on from scenes where the female characters go to bed in full makeup and run around in the dark announcing their presence to anyone with ears , but not this one . I also find it inconceivable that none of them could be bothered to secure the front door from arbitrarily opening day and night . To give you an idea about how uninvolved I was with these characters , I spent most of my time thinking about how cold it must have been on the set because everyone was in a coat even in their houses and how white their teeth were.Despite all the formulaic plot machinations , the film does not build any suspense at all except to wonder when it will be over . There is more atmosphere at the local Giant in the middle of the most mundane of weekday afternoons . As for the dialogue , I could have sampled quotes from ten other films and cobbled together better , more believable discourse . The gore level , the eye candy for a horror fan , was minimal at best . Without their tiny weapons , the ' zombies ' were not menacing at all . You could probably drop kick a couple of them across the room.What really kills it is its banality . Horror films , more than any other genre , cannot survive uninspired mediocrity . Give me a horror movie that is comically inept or outrageously over the top with gore . I can even take the new ones with their cringe inducing torture . Every once in a while I 'd appreciate a truly frightening one , anything but this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of the other commenters mentioned that they almost walked out . If I hadn 't been with my wife , who wanted to stay , I would have left . It 's a shame , too , because I think it could have been a good movie . But this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplays I 've ever seen . It starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere ( I would say it goes nowhere fast , but it really goes nowhere slow ... painfully slow ) . From time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen , or that there is potentially some depth underneath one of the characters , but that 's all we get - hints . There is not a single payoff or revelation in the entire movie . Not that I need a slick plot to be entertained ... I love a good meandering character study as much as the next indie buff . But these characters add up to nothing . For the entire duration of the film you don 't care what happens to a single one of them . As a matter of fact , you almost start hoping they die , because at least a death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior , which is so strange and unpredictable that you 'd think it in itself would be compelling , but it 's not . Instead of quirky , noir-esquire characters acting in hard-boiled fashion , you simply recognize it immediately for what it is : a bunch of talented but miscast actors , brooding and raising their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context . All this for two plodding , painfully slow hours . Awful . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third movie in the Home Alone empire . Four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car . Because of baggage confusion , grouchy Mrs. Hess ( Marian Seldes ) gets the car . She gives it to her neighbor , Alex ( Linz ) , just before the spies turn up . The spies rent a house in order to burglarize each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car . Home alone with the chicken pox , Alex calls 911 each time he spots a theft in progress , but the spies always manage to elude the police while Alex is accused of making prank calls . The spies finally turn their attentions toward Alex , unaware that he has rigged devices to cleverly booby-trap his entire house . Home Alone 3 wasn 't horrible , but probably shouldn 't have been made , you can 't just replace Macauley Culkin , Joe Pesci , or Daniel Stern . Home Alone 3 had some funny parts , but I don 't like when characters are changed in a movie series , view at own risk . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" they should make terrorists watch this video as torture , and not just for the disturbing final scene in which tying up and beating a woman with mental problems is apparently a source of comedy. about a half hour of this would convince even the staunchest fundamentalist to spill the beans rather than sit through even one more minute of this disaster.This movie is awful . I rented it because a friend said it was hilarious , only to find he was talking about the blowhard director doing the commentary rather than the movie itself . I guess if you find unrestrained arrogance funny , you 'll like this . It apparently is true that he goes on and on about chicks he 's " " banged " , " the most tasteless example being when the lead actress comes on screen.Actually CJ Stacy was the only good part of this movie - her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrid dung pile .

There is considerable anti-gun talk , but we all know where that is going . Toward the end , there 's lots of action and a rape thrown in . Somebody must pay , and they do .

" It might be that the film I saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw , however as the actors are the same I can only think that the cut I saw in Europe differed from the one circulating in the US.Anyway , this was the worst movie that I saw the past five years . ( Closely followed by The Waterboy ... ) Why : Because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one , mixed them , put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it . ( Examples : nothing happends , the music gets scary , and still nothing happends . The " " grumpy " " officer us grumpy in a way that would let the actor flunk any acting class .

" This story of Ted Brice , an American pilot who is the sole survivor of the crash of an Allied reconnaissance plane in Belgium in January of 1944 , is pretty much of a mess . The title would lead you to think that it is principally a story about the Belgian armed resistance groups , but that seems to be just a backdrop to prop up a silly love story between Ted and Claire , the woman who takes Ted in . Claire 's husband Henri is a committed resistance member , but it is Claire who decides , in Henri 's absence and against his wishes , to give Ted refuge.Crucial plot details don 't make sense . Central to the story is the retrieval of the recorder on the downed plane that contains navigation codes and the positions of targets . But in the opening scene we see Belgians looting the plane , resistance members among them . Why did they not retrieve the valued items at that time instead of waiting for the Nazis to come and guard the plane ? And the whole affair of transferring Ted out of the area was conducted using secret instructions and code words when the transaction could have just been a simple exchange . The ponderous music attempts , but fails , to lend some weight to this tepid undertaking.The most ludicrous part of the movie is how the love affair develops between Ted and Claire . At first Claire is devoted to nursing Ted back from near death and , when Ted starts to recover , they become physically involved ( while Henri is conveniently away conducting resistance business ) . Julie Ormond does a passable job as Claire , but she effects a French accent that I frequently found impossible to understand . Her responses seemed a little weak at times - when informed of the hanging deaths of several town members she reacts as though she had just been told that the local grocery was out of peaches . As Ted , Bill Paxton seems just to be reciting his lines ; his performance is so uninspired that it 's embarrassing . A true American pilot might evidence such a flat personality , but it does not make for convincing cinema . I did not sense any chemistry between these supposed lovers.The most idiotic thing is the way that Ted and Claire act like lovers on holiday . Maybe sexual release from such heavy situations is understandable , but to appear totally oblivious of the gravity of the situation is hard to fathom . At first Ted is consigned to an attic room and Claire worries about his even coming into the house . But as things develop he not only comes into the house , he dances with Claire to loud music , enters the adjoining barn to have a game of baseball with a local boy , and ultimately goes on a car trip with Claire to a nearby town.The young boy seems to be most committed to his role , but he is undermined by the script . He has an uncanny ability to be at crucial events without being noticed . And when he delivers lines like : " " Have you ever seen someone get hanged . They look like the 're dancing , but they can 't find the floor . " " you feel that it is the screenwriter talking and not a thirteen year old boy.And oh , by the way , there are scenes to show that the Nazis are pretty bad guys.Comparing this film to the brilliant " " Ashes and Diamonds " " about the Polish resistance , or the equally stellar " " Lacombe , Lucien " " about the French resistance , one realizes what a truly dismal affair it is . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I do not know who is to blame , Miss Leigh or her director , but her performance as Catherine is almost impossible to watch . Ben Chaplin on the other hand does a superior job - against all odds as far as I am concerned . His character is entirely too charming and appealing. but certainly not shown as greedy enough , to put up with Leigh 's character 's silliness . Chaplin appears bemused by what cannot possibly be understood as Leigh 's shyness and lack of grace , but rather her orthopedic unsteadiness . There has to be some element of believability to his interest , but as played it is incomprehensible . The performances do not jibe . Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are , of course , wonderful despite any effort to derail them . The supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch . What a pity , too , the leads don 't work together because the production is lovely to look at . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Did someone find the plot somewhere in the film ? . Perhaps it is the thing missing in this pretentious exercise of cinema about cinema .

" This mini series , also based on a book by Alex Haley as was ' Queen ' , tried to use similar formulas , that is , constructing a long history following the lives of a family over many years . Whereas in ' Queen ' the result was masterful , here in Mama Flora the inspiration was lacking . Firstly perhaps in the book itself , and most certainly in this TV production . Too much is put in with too much haste over the years , such that the unfolding saga is shallow , superficial , not nearly so authentic as in ' Queen ' . Full marks for the scenification in the earlier parts of the film , which was prepared with great care , but as the film progressed it seemed to degenerate into a kind of dallasian-forsythian unpalatable mix in the last third of its three hours or so duration . I had hoped for more ; but evidently Haley was less inspired with this tale than his near-biographical ' Queen ' , and Peter Werner III is no match for John Erman . Only recommendable for those who have an appetite for these lengthy tales of generations growing up . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth . Unfortunately , her role required no . She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film . Luise 's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni 's character ( he did a fantastic job for his performance ) . Set in ancient Asia , both actors were not Asian , but were very convincing in their roles . I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance , because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for . She must have been a breakthrough actress , one of the first to method act . This seems like something that Hollywood does often . Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban . I felt Luise 's performance to be lackluster throughout , and when she died , she did not change in expression from any previous scenes . She stayed the same throughout the film ; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice . If her brilliant acting was so subtle , I suppose I did not see it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Legend of Bloody Jack is set in the Alaskan wilderness & starts as a relative of some murderous deceased occultist Lumberjack reads incantations ( The Evil Dead ( 1982 ) style ) from an ancient spell book in an attempt to resurrect him , he succeeds & not being a big believer in family unity the Lumberjack dude kills his relative . Two days later & Ray ( Travis Quentin Young ) along with his sister Dawn ( Erica Hoag ) , her boyfriend Nick ( Craig Bonacorsi ) & four of their friends pull up outside a cosy log cabin ( The Evil Dead style ... ) with a view to a relaxing weekend in the wilderness . Unfortuntaely the killer Lumberjack dude show 's up with his axe & starts to slaughter the friends one-by-one ... Edited , written , executive produced & directed by Todd Portugal this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me , I 'm just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video . The script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes , it has every bad slasher clich챕 , the character 's are awful , the dialogue is terrible & it 's hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film . The teens are even more annoying & stupid than usual , the script is more moronic , predictable & flawed than usual & the killer Lumberjack dude is just lame . Then there 's the final 10 minutes or so which , if you make it that far & believe it 's tough going , produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as I 'm concerned pokes fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through 90 minutes worth of crap . I will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn 't want to know it stop reading now . Basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to Ray telling a story & it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen & Nick & Dawn & everyone else berates him for telling such a bad story ( I felt their pain ) & then proceed to pick holes in it & laugh at it . From saying why did they stand around & argue , why didn 't they pick the axe up & such things , I felt like this was poking fun at the audience as those were the sorts of things I was asking myself while watching this crap & to have it shoved down my throat & made perfectly clear that the makers knew the script was crap & could see all the holes in it & went for a twist ending which unashamedly rubbishes the preceding 80 minutes ( which we have just had to sit through remember ) is just a little grating . Then to add insult to injury the Lumberjack dude turns up & kills everyone within two minutes , why didn 't he do that to start with ? It would have saved everyone a lot of time.Director Portugal turns in a real mess , this has the worst continuity between night & day in a film I have ever seen . The whole film is meant to set at night & I suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it didn 't work & most of it looks like it is set during the day . For example , look at when Lisa is trapped in the bathroom & she climbs out of the window . It is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground & the films cuts to an exterior shot it 's bright daylight . Then there 's the fact Ranger Vince says we can 't get a search party out here until ' the morning ' indicating it was supposed to be night , then several minutes later when he walks outside & it looks like it 's the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on & he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like it 's night . Anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows , it 's pitch black outside & when the Ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example . The continuity in this film is simply the worst I have ever seen . There isn 't much gore , there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable . It 's not scary , there 's no tension or atmosphere & the appalling day & night continuity is just so distracting because it 's so obvious.Technically the film is rock bottom , again the continuity between night & day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is . The special effects are poor & they couldn 't even afford to show a car blowing up even though it 's pretty vital to the plot . This has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish . The acting is absolutely brilliant & everyone involved should get an Oscar , nah only joking , not really they were utterly awful & even the girls who got their breasts out weren 't very good looking.The Legend of Bloody Jack is just an awful teen slasher flick , it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a tripod or steadycam , it has awful effects , is boring & has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or I 've got it totally wrong & it 's the most clever . Not recommended , watch a decent slasher from the 70 's or 80 's to remind you how they should be done . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have yesterday seen the second part . And I must say , it was actually better then the first one . At the begin , I realized , It is actually a sequel , not a remake but not a good one . I do not like the old movies and series of Galactica , because the cylons saw like toasters ( just as it was mentioned in this new movie ) and were completely harmless for the old galactica . This movie turns the sides - the Humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid . Many scenes were unnecessary , for instance the story of the " " computer expert " " - completely a crap . If I were a scriptwriter I would leave him die in his house , killed by the cylon woman . And the evacuation from the planet ? Oh , please if it would be bombed by 50 Megatons ( why exactly 50 MT ? ? ) nukes , they would be dead killed by the radiation . And how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack ? Aha , it was possibly this computer virus , created by the cylon - the script was probably written by ten-years-old school boy . The good side of the movie is , that the humans are at last defeated ! ! Really defeated , the population is near the extinction ( children are dieing - two times explicit in the movie : 1. a baby ! ! ! maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten - what a violence ... ) . And the bad-asses won and I think it is the first time in such sci-fi galaxy fight movie . I also appreciate the design of the cylons ( not only of the humanoid cylon : - ) a good job with these ships - I like the design of the ships by both of them - human an cylons . The human ships are a good never version of the old ones . And galactica - really pretty with these docks , I liked that . But this is all , only the design is not enough . The acting was really bad , the whole plot was expectable ( only two things not - the human-cylon on the ragnardocks and the human-cylon at the end ) .The dialogs were trivial ( and in the Slovak dabbing just stupid , but that is not fault of the movie ) . The whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series , but who would shoot such series ? What it would be about ?

When the sound track music is better than the film , you know you are in trouble .

" Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies.You 'd think that after such dismal flicks " " Superstar " , " " " Night at the Roxbury " , " and " " Coneheads " , " he 'd start to get the notion that maybe he doesn 't know what he 's doing when it comes to movies ( and many would argue that he doesn 't know what he 's doing when it comes to television , as well ) . Trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on SNL makes no sense.I personally like Tim Meadows , and think that he would be great in the right movie . It 's a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation , and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene . Any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad , not because it 's funny.Oh well , at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have films done about them . It 's just too bad that this one made it to the big screen . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I thought that this movie lacked the building dramatic suspense the first movie had . This is hard to accomplish when the film takes place over a week . The original movie lead up to the final climatic scene over a period of a year and it still was less violent than the sequel . One good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly , because the plot seemed rushed . When Rachel 's best friend died there was no funeral mentioned in the movie . Another bring down was the involvement of Amy Irving . All her scenes brought down the movies pace . The dialog in this movie was terrible . It in no way reflected the way kids talk .

" I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies . The more bizarre and imaginative the film , the more blood and guts , the better , and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right . Luther starts out well enough ... his origin at the circus , a creepy run at a supermarket , an attack of an old lady , and his disturbing occupation of a woman 's farmhouse all set the mood nicely . A hot sex / shower scene ensues when the woman 's daughter and daughter 's boyfriend arrives at the house . When Luther steals the boyfriends motorbike the movie takes a turn for the worse . The characters are presented with numerous opportunities to : A ) save their loved ones , B ) get the police to help , C ) escape , or ( most importantly ) D ) KILL LUTHER ! ! ! I can 't feel empathy or fear for characters that are too stupid to help themselves . Chareters snub chances to arm themselves with guns and knives while Luther is away . A policeman eventually arrives and is equally ineffective in stopping Luther , even though at one point he has a rifle squarely aimed at Luther while Luther clucks and does his rendition of the polish chicken dance . I found myself futilely coaching my television : " " Make sure he 's dead ! " , " " " Hes gone , get out of there ! " , " or " " Just kill him already ! " " Luther is a bloodthirsty savage , but he is hardly Hannibal Lecter . If you can 't outsmart this egghead , you deserve what 's coming to you . By halfway through the movie you 'll be so lethargic to the fates of the half-wits that only morbid curiosity will sustain you to last to the mildly amusing ending .

" Right , where do I start ? I cannot even imagine to comprehend this preteen pathetic excuse of a show . Picture this : a boarding school , where kids whose parents are rolling in money simply chuck them in there so as to jet around the world themselves . It could not get any more diabolic than this.If you taught these kids , shall not even upgrade them to the term teenagers , because they hardly even act like sane homosapiens , were self-centered , think again . About 23 minutes choked full of their so-called problems , boy troubles , and the like.The heroine of the show , of course , Mademoiselle Zoey , played by Britney 's Polly Pocket Little Miss I 'm All That sister , Jamie Lynn Spears , has obviously much to learn about acting . However , I will give her some face , because her superficial , one dimensional character , does not allow much room for depth . She plays Pacific Coast Academy 's sun , moon and stars , crusader fighting for the plight of all women , equality of all genders.Perfect in everyway , always with her two loyal sidekicks , Nicole , the daffy bimbo , who obviously has too much of Daddy 's cash , and tough chick , Dana , who proves a hard nut to crack . Both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively , not that I blame that . But horror of horrors , in comes Lola , who deems herself the greatest actress since Natalie Wood , with green feathers in her hair and fake tan . She is even more rude than Zoey herself , if that is even possible , and even more dumber than Nicole , and hell , we know that cannot be possible.This show , like all the sorry excuses for television programmes Nickelodeon has been spewing out since 2000s , is a prime victim of stereotyping . Get girl next door and dense to her best friend 's feelings for her Zoey , a great albeit inarticulate at times best boy friend , Chase , a cool , arrogant ladies man , Logan , a boy and clothes crazy girl , who is not very bright , Nicole , the one whom everyone thinks is weird just because she is extremely smart , the nerd , Quinn , the over-dramatic , annoying yet super thin , Malibu picture perfect model , Lola , and the tough yet soft inside woman , Dana . Now , where have I heard these characters before ? I am sorry , but what is so wrong with having a personality ? Just because Quinn is passionate about Science , and actually cares about her future and doing well in the academic aspect , in which the rest should be concerned about as well , she is " " weird " " and a " " nerd " " ? Lola at the beginning of the series , proved to be a potential great character with her sassy ways and different outlook in life , Zoey just had to go , get out your pitchforks , burn her at the stake , she 's going back to Weird Town and all that jazz . So much for womens rights . Unfortunately , Lola just became nothing more of another OC clone , in all its anorexic glory . Probably so as to not outshine her Mistress.But hey , the 2000 generation of MySpace whores seem to love it with the Chase / Zoey typical fairytale romance , the tension between adamant , " " hot " " Logan and " " kick-ass " " Zoey or Dana , whichever to your liking , and the pretty people . Please , this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism , they prefer a pretentious , shallow and vapid lifestyle . Sorry to break it to you darlings , that will not happen , unless you have a major trust fund and parents to cushion you . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" After Life is a Miracle , I did not expect much . It 's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell , for instance . Zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story . The wild and unbridled humor of Underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here . It appears that Kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies , beginning with Black Cat , White Cat , which I think was great , but already had some disturbing signs of dementia . I liked his early films so much , and this is why it 's especially disappointing to see something like this . Let 's hope his next one will be great . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched the first episode of " " The War at Home " " because I thought it was worth replacing " " Arrested Development " , " boy , was I disappointed . It should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly ripped-off of " " Grounded for Life " , " " " Titus " , " and " " Married ... with Children " " since they are all similar in plot and overall mood . The so called " " punch lines " " are all repetitious and formulaic , even more , those " " punch lines " " aren 't even funny at all , to me , they 're more along the lines as being crass and crude . The main character Dave Gold acts like a white trash thug , who thinks he 's being funny and cool , which he 's not . ( Even Hillary ( Dave 's daughter ) said so in the episode " " Gaza Strip " " ) .In the episode " " Dream Crusher " , " Hillary wanted to be a singer { but was actually pretty bad } , Dave and Vicky then gladly decided to crush her dreams by telling her she sucked . After that , she then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned on going to Harvard , after telling Dave and Vicky so and left the room , the two of them began mindlessly mocking her . Also , in the first episode Dave said of Hillary 's { black } boyfriend " " Does she actually think we 're gonna let her go out with this guy ? I 'd rather drink my own urine " , " that line has to the dumbest line in the history of television . And Dave is constantly making fun of Larry ( his son ) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he 's gay and is a geek . Also , let 's not forget that he also made fun of Larry 's ( fat ) girlfriend . Dave is the father he 's supposed to stand up for his son no matter what . " " The War at Home " " is without a doubt the worst TV show for family . That clearly explains why the show should be canceled since it spreads a racism and homophobic agenda . It 's like the show wants to be funny for always putting in that stupid laugh track every time someone says something , but the lines are all somewhat forced , idiotic and pathetically juvenile.Another reason why the show 's horrible is the acting , Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible , terrible actors . Rappaport has to always move his hands around when he 's in front of the camera , he not only does this on this show but he also did that during his time with " " Boston Public " . " Sullivan talks and acts like some kind of robot every time he acts ( he also did this in " " Malcolm in the Middle " " } .So to wrap this whole thing up , you all got your reasons of what 's wrong with this show 1.It 's unoriginal 2.The acting sucks 3.It 's not even funny 4.All the jokes are the same 5.Has lousy script 6.The characters are pitiful and unlikable 7.The dad 's a rip-off of Archie BunkerFOX needs to take this trash off the air , because anything 's better than this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Any movie with " " National Lampoon " " in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in London , England , Paris , France , Rome , Italy , and anywhere in Germany.It may be an institution in the U.S. but it is practically unknown in Europe to the larger audience . " " National Lampoon 's European Vacation " " is unlikely to rectify that situation . The appalling Griswalds are just that - appalling.They are not funny . Clearly Mr Chevy Chase thinks he 's funny , after all Miss B.di Angelo laughs a lot at his jokes , but she 's getting paid for it and didn 't have to fork out 짙2.50 for the privilege . The section set in England is typical.The same old same old TV performers , Messrs Idle , Smith , Coltrane , Miss M.Lippman trot out the same old same old tired clich챕s , Mr Chase gets lost in the hotel corridor .... yawn , yawn , yawn ..

Every possible " " comic " " situation is worked to death , Mr Chase gurns desperately , Miss di Angelo dimples sweetly , the children are embarrassingly bad .

" A couple move into their dream home , unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery . The film is said to have been based on a true story , although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed . The plot is hardly unique - see Spielberg 's ' Poltergeist ' ( 1982 ) . Within a short time , they experience various supernatural phenomena : these range from the disturbing - mysterious shadows , the serious illness of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous - toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control . There is little depth to the story : once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery , we do not learn anything more . The plot does not seem to develop . The characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable , nor is the atmosphere particularly special . The film could be disturbing to some viewers . There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There are so many holes in the plot , it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together . I don 't know much about George Zucco , but I 've seen him in two movies . Obviously , he has been cast as the loving father , mad scientist , vampire guy . He looks so ordinary . I 'm surprised that he ended up in the genre . This is the typical , " " I will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army . " " By transferring wolf blood ( or is it coyote ) to his hired hand , he turns him into a werewolf . Glen Strange , who was one of Karloff 's successor 's as the Frankenstein monster , plays the kindly , lovable hired man who is victimized because he trusts the mad doctor . At first the scientist is able to control when Petro ( his name ) can be transformed . But , like the invisible man , suddenly he starts morphing on his own and becomes a liability . There is a little love story of the daughter and a reporter with kind of a high pitched voice ( Golly Miss Brooks ) . She wants to leave but her father , the doctor , won 't allow that . He is also driven by a group of his peers who mocked his research before and now he is going to have satisfaction . The way he plot to embarrass or kill them is pretty far fetched and depends a lot on Petro and the guys sitting around waiting to be attacked . It 's not a very good movie . The strong point is atmosphere of the woods as people and monsters lurk around the Spanish moss . Once again , the townsfolk are a bunch of morons , who look like they escaped from a bad western . One thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and that seems unusual for a film of this era . There 's also a pipe smoking old lady who knows about werewolves but nobody listens to her . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Obviously with this film going straight to DVD I wasn 't expecting a lot but this film is so unfunny it is unbelievable . The only part of the film that you actually may find remotely funny is before they even get to the island , where Eddie 's son is blasted out of the bathroom by a jet of water and then that 's it ! Why do they bother at all ? The first Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase was brilliant and hilarious . This is not . They rely on jokes concerning a dog with flatulence , and a character called Uncle Nick who is about 80 and keeps trying to get his way with beautiful women . When they approach the island on the boat , the island in the background just looks so fake and Randy Quaid although funny in the previous film , just overacts and seems like he 's trying too hard to be funny . You have been warned ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is basically about some girls in a Catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to Florida for a vacation . On their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on . The girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved . She becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened . The other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer . Then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell . The deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just can 't put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that . The best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually WANTS to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene I admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind . This movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller " " Blood Song " " with Frankie Avalon staring in it , the same motive just a different character part . It 's not a movie worth renting not even for an 80 's low-budget movie and the ending was the worst ending I have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina . Instead I watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family . And this went on and on . If Mr. McElwee 's family had prevailed over the Dukes I doubt that Mr. McElwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco-related diseases . I grew up near the area where Mr. McElwee 's family began it tobacco business ; I expected more than McEwee 's continual focus on his family . I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the ramifications to the state 's economy by tighter regulation of tobacco . The countless references to the movie " " Bright Leaves " " are out of place - So what if Gary Cooper played Mr. McElwee 's great grandfather ?

" This is not the true story . It is the darkest possible fiction derived from the events .

That anyone would suggest this is a true rendering , however , is very much false advertising . You want the real story ? Rent ' Fairy Tale ' . That 's the real story .

" First , I am not really a fan of the whole " " things eating flesh in disgusting new ways " " genre of film but I am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever . This one . So we start watching it . First and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod ! Second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man ! Third , none of the dialogue makes any sense . Fourth , the zombie scenes , though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste , lead me to believe the director ( and my next door neighbor ) are in need of psychological help . It 's funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast . It 's so amateurish it 's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook .... with zombies .

" Okay , so I forgot to watch and only caught the last episode , thinking it was the first or second . Honestly , I thought CM would have at least one more installment to resolve plot points . The Rangers are left stranded on the plains ( " " We 'll have to eat the horses " " ) , for one thing . Little Newt is bereft , for another . What a downer ending ! But my biggest complaint , esp. if this was the finale , is that the episode had no suspense , no big climax , no dramatic confrontations . Even the last fight between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was badly staged . The whole episode had terrible pacing , which is what drives a Western . Steve Zahn was watchable , Karl Urban ( a ringer for Johnny Knoxville ) played Call like a man with a terminal case of lockjaw . All glowering looks and jingling spurs and jutting chin . And what 's with the Rangers ? They talked big , about cleaning up Texas , then milled around aimlessly in the middle of town , getting drunk . And how nice of Hal Holbrook to loan Val Kilmer his Mark Twain wig and stache ! The set of Austin was like the fake Rock Ridge from Blazing Saddles , all facade . I admit I was drawn into the plot , but that 's mainly cause there were many things I didn 't quite get , thanks to coming in late in story . If I 'd watched from the beginning , I might not have gotten to episode three . Now I have to go watch Silverado to cleanse my palette . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * * SPOILERS * * The killer in the movie doesn 't wait a second as we see him sneaking into a girls shower and hacking her to death taking her severed and bloodied arm as he makes his getaway . We then get this official looking prologue , as if were watching a true story , stating that a number of gruesome murders were committed in the late fall of 1985 in a small mid-western collage.Grandfatherly looking , and hearing impaired , Sheriff Ron Delboys is baffled by this murder and later when the murders of local collage students , all women , continues his run for state senator is in jeopardy with him bumbling the investigation at every turn . There 's at least two times when Delboys says that they 'll never be another murder as long as he 's on the case and within minutes another murder happens.Finding a golden amulet at the scene of each murder the sheriff 's daughter , the collage librarian , Tina finds this reference book about Withcraft indicating that the amulet is a symbol of a witches cult that originated in the early 1700 just after the Salem Witch Trials . This cult was out to avenge the 19 accused witches hung by the local townspeople back in 1692 and they went out at night killing men and women of authority and taking off with a body part . When the body parts would form a complete person they would be burned in an occult midnight bonfire ritual.You never get a handle to what 's exactly happening in the movie " " Blood Cult " " not just because it 's totally disjointed story but it 's ever more outrageous and grad-school level acing especially by Charles Ellis playing the butterfingered sheriff Ron Delboys . Getting himself into more trouble then even the on the loose killer could have gotten him into . The bumbling Sheriff Delboys ends up with his head busted coffee spiked as well as almost burned alive , after being dismembered . The only reason he wasn 't is because he seemed to have dreamt it all up while under the influence of some strong and unnamed drug.There 's a weird dream sequence in the movie suggesting that a number of highly respected members of the community are members of the Witches Cult that 's responsible for the sorority murders . The movie doesn 't bother to explain at all if the dream , that the drugged Sheriff Delboys had , was a dream or actually a real experience on his part by dropping the whole thing as if it were cut out of the movie ! Getting out of the hospital and staking out the collage sorority house , while munching down a bag full of McDonald cheeseburgers , Sheriff Delboys finally comes face to face with the killer . Shefiff Delboys find out to his shock and amazement that not only does he know who he , or she , is but he 's also willing to let the killer escape ! The very first straight to video motion picture and it shows . Not only would no one it their right mind be crazy enough to pay admission , at least with the video you can tape over it Thank God , to see this disaster but no movie-house owner would dare play it on their screen without the danger of the outraged patrons , in a justifiable show of righteous indignation , tear the place apart ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The fourth " " Tremors " " feature goes back in time , to the year 1889 . " " The Legend Begins " " in the small city of " " Perfection " , " which was then " " Rejection , Nevada " . " As the story begins , seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly " " Graboids " . " Some of the characters in the present-day " " Tremors " " films have ancestors , both figurative and literal , in the past . Most obvious is the ever-returning Michael Gross ( as Hiram Gummer ) . Unlike his descendant , Mr. Gross is inept with firearms ; so , he hires gunslinger Billy Drago ( as " " Black Hand " " Kelly ) to shoot ' em up some " " Dirt Dragons " . " This one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past . It 's like a western with miniature versions of the original film 's monster " " Graboids " . " These tamer " " Dirt Dragons " " are nowhere near as terrorizing as their " " Tremors " " ( 1990 ) counterparts . Consequently , in this film , the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground , which would not have happened in the original movie .

" It 's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds . Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life , melodramatic , overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror.If comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and , yes , it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accent and facial contortions .

" Space is a vacuum , right ? Therefore , space sucks . Vampires also suck . A really bad vampire movie set in space would have twice the sucking power , right ?

There 's a salvage crew that 's sent out to investigate a cargo ship that 's lost in space called the Demeter . Fans of the original novel will unwittingly assume that this is to be a straightforward retelling of Dracula set in the future ... unfortunately , short of sharing character names , this one takes the lowbrow route and goes into the B-movie galaxy twenty minutes later when Coolio becomes a vampire . Trust me when I tell you he 's the best actor in the movie , and that 's not saying much.Casper Van Dien should be peddling his wares on daytime television . Erika Eleniak should have quit after she left Baywatch and poor Udo Kier is having trouble reading from the cue cards .

" It 's true that Danny Steinmann 's " " The Unseen " " is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot , no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single clich챕 the genre has brought forward over the decades , but that doesn 't necessarily make it a bad film . On the contrary , my friends and I were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80 's shock- feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting . The beautiful and ambitious reporter Jennifer Fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little Californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival , but their hotel forgot to register their booking . In their search for a place to stay , the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator Ernest Keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion . One by one the girls experience that Keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister Victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house . " " The Unseen " " can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics " " Psycho " " and " " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " . " The plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films , like twisted family secrets in the cellar , voyeurism , crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens . Still , I don 't consider these to be negative remarks , as " " The Unseen " " is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade . Although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast , director Steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house " " unseen " " like the title promised . The casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre . Sydney Lassick , immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient Charley Cheswick in " " One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest " " is truly the ideal choice for the role of Ernest Keller . His persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed . Also Stephen Furst , who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen , gives away a tremendous performance as " " Junior " . " He looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to Jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving . " " The Unseen " " is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early 80 's film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70 's exploitation and generally weird stuff . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First , let me start by saying that I am a Laurel and Hardy buff . I have read every book printed about them , and have seen all of their available films more than once . I even took a chance once , and called Stan on the telephone . He was very kind , and spoke with me for over ten minutes . I followed with a letter , and he wrote me a letter back . I still have that letter.This film has some fine comedy moments , but Stan and Ollie are not up to their usual form . Stan was gravely ill during the production and looked worse than he did ten years later . In my opinion , any Laurel and Hardy film is worth seeing.But the Ultimate opinion of this film comes from the great Stan Laurel himself . To quote him , " " This film should never have been made .

" * * * * * * Spoilers within * * * * * * * What a dull , predictable , non-scary snore-fest . The movie had no character development : I felt no empathy towards any of the characters ( except may be the small boy ) , and did not care what happened to any of them . The movie had so many clich챕d bits , or elements stolen from other horror movies.The movie was so predictable . Many times I would be saying to myself , " " Let me guess , { fill in guess } happens next ? " " Yup , I was right . Even in the opening scene , I predicted that the " " attack " " on the family was by some man , probably the father ( because only the wife and children were attacked ) . Sure enough , that is what happened ( of course , you have to wait 79 minutes to find out for sure ) . And , of course , another " " evil man " " scenario . Why was he evil and killing his family ? Because he 's a man , duh ! As someone else stated , this movie may be scary for someone under 13 years of age , or for a movie from the 1970 's , but it is FAR from being a ' scary ' movie by todays standards . AND , like so many other crap horror movies , a lot of the scares were " " fakes " . " Scary music , Scary music , Scary music , and ..... A crow suddenly flies at the window ! Wow , scary ! How did the old bank guy manage , a few times , to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him ? I thought , for sure , that the old man was a ghost .

" Let 's get one thing straight : I like much of Snipes ' work . Unlike his other high-kicking contemporaries ( Seagal and Van Damme ) he can actually act . This film , however , does little to enhance his reputation ; it 's not exactly unwatchable - but I am not in any hurry to watch it again either . In fact , if I never saw it again it wouldn 't bother me - there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on ! It 's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film . Instead the director has chosen to almost try and bludgeon his audience into submission with too much over-the-top violence and very little characterisation.The biggest problem I have is with Snipes ' co-star , Silvia Colloca . It baffles me that the producers of this film went to all the bother of hiring a stunning beautiful ( for my money anyway ) and talented actress like Miss Colloca and then give her such a pathetic one-dimensional character to play with . If she was hired to simply add a bit of " " glamour " " to the movie she doesn 't even do that very well ; there 's no nudity in the film and also no sex scene worth mentioning . Strange , really . Given the amount of violence in this film it baffles me why the producers have taken such a conservative attitude to sex and nudity . Are we living in 2007 or in 1957 ? What the producers of this rubbish ( and probably the actors as well ) have forgotten is that films are meant to be fantasies . Like most of the inhabitants of this planet my real life is very boring . I would love to be chasing terrorists , be able to handle myself like Mr Snipes and hook up with a beautiful young thing like Miss Colloca . This film satisfies none of those fantasies very well . Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of the worst movie I have ever seen . It 's a thriller with a rather ridiculous ending . I watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something truly bad. the movie starred two actors that I like very much , Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas . Sure they had decent chemistry together but for what ? The movie 's premise was bad to begin with and the execution just made it even worst.Miss DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor , a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense hinge on multiple personality disorder . That pretty much will give you a hint to where the movie is going and the identity of the killer . Early in the movie she gets an unexpected visit from her father . This being made in the 1990 's when the bad daddy was the in thing in Hollywood is another clue to the ultimate conclusion.Mr. Banderas plays a mystery man named Tony Ramirez , who comes into Sarah 's life . The whole first meeting and first encounter between Tony and Sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing it makes you wonder how it even got shot . And there 's a sequence where the two of them are supposed to be knowing each other that is so sappy it doesn 't seem to belong here . One thing that I would admit was that there was a sex scene that 's very hot . Anyway creepy things start to happen after he arrives , weird packages arriving , things falling off the wall that could kill Sarah , incident that say things aren 't normal anymore . Overall the movie was badly conceived , the editing at times seem jumpy , and the conclusion was laughable . Another thing that bugged me about this movie was the whole Orchestral music playing in the background . A more subtle musical score would have been better . I have to say this , no matter how bad the ending was , Miss DeMornay was very good in that sequence . It 's sad that she never got first rate materials in her career . She 's that rare combination of talent and beauty . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Alleged " " scream queen " " Debbie Rochon and her group of frontier prostitutes travel west to the title location and encounter grisly killings that turn out to be the work of a cult of ex-Confederate psychopaths attempting to resurrect the south through pointless massacre.Action and suspense take a backseat to loads of boring dialog and uninteresting character development.Billy Drago is good in the thankless ( not to mention pointless ) role of the town mortician but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor , including the town and the fort , both of which look like modern made western tourist traps and costumes that look like they were bought at Party City.Do yourself a big favor and watch Ravenous instead . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" with all the European studios involved in this one , you would think you 'd at least get some pretty photography ; but the local color is kept to a minimum.Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent in order to play a Spanish cop - WTF ? The story is hopelessly confused . There 's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused - is she or isn 't she a lesbian ? - serving no purpose whatsoever . The cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time . There seems to be some message about the mid- ' 30s Spanish Civil War But since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead , one doesn 't see the point in it.Despite the bull-fighting backdrop of part of the narrative ( which part ? who can tell ) , you never even get a good look at a bull fight .

Besides the protagonist doesn 't fall in love desire with a British girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman , so why rowing against Yale .

" Prior to this film , I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi : the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore ( 1981 ) , famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man-child Peter Bark , and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer . Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema , but both were entertaining in their own special way ( and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn 't hurt ) . Massacre , however , is dull , dull , dull , despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh.The story , about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot , is confusing and oh-so boring : when the blood isn 't flowing and the skin isn 't on show , the film is a real struggle to sit through ( it took me four attempts to finish ) , with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note.The only point of interest about the film is that its producer , Lucio Fulci , used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega-gory movie Cat In The Brain ( AKA Nightmare Concert ) . And if you 've already seen that film , then there is very little reason to bother with Massacre . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A missed train . A wrong phone number . An extra cup of coffee . What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision ? Most people don 't give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions . " " Happenstance " " tells the story of the interrelations and cause-and-effect of the mundane as it pertains to a group of normal Parisian folk . It has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater , with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned.There 's a cheating husband , an illegal immigrant , a classic slacker , a pickpocket , a crazy grandmother , an annoying girlfriend , a selfish roommate , and a homeless man . Audrey Tautou serves as the erstwhile protagonist ( in the sense that she 's on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the film ) and normal girl who just can 't seem to find the right rhythm in her life.She learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her . What happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters . Does the prediction come true ? The concept is good , but the storytelling is flimsy . The connections from one event to the next are weak . There 's better storytelling in 15 seconds of the Liberty Mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of Happenstance.If you enjoy Audrey Tautou , then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film , but you 'll finish it dissatisfied and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and director . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This film is a third rate attempt at a compelling , moody thriller and fails miserably on all three counts . It just about managed to keep my attention as the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the life rules he had conveniently set himself at the beginning of the film.But it 's in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral . A vaguely plausible plotline ( and that 's being generous ) becomes completely rediculous as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and bizzarre events are never explained.This wouldn 't be quite so bad if the scripting wasn 't so cheesy , the acting so wooden ( despite a strong British cast ) and the direction so uninspiring . This is not an example of good British film making nor indeed should it make Tarantino bat an eyelid , at least not in comparison to his earlier work.My advice in this case , if it 's hard to get hold of , don 't waste the effort . If you 're a Brit like me and it 's in your local video shop , steer well clear . Perhaps head to the video entitled " " American Beauty " " - now that 's an example of great British direction . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I disliked this movie for numerous reasons . Within the first ten minutes of the film , I grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself , for me at least , that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had dug . Unfortunately , that did not occur . The two draws of the movie for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman . I don 't know enough about Lindsey Lohan 's work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film . Afterward , I just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were " " moments " " in each of their performances . I imagine that for each of them to find their " " moments " " was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog . Although the plot is an interesting one , the movie on the whole is so poorly written , directed and edited that anybody 's performance as an actor would suffer and be tainted by it . The disrespectful way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of small-town America , I think , were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it 's mark . As one reviewer has noted and I would agree , the movie is almost impossible to market given it 's finished form . I suspect that , or at least hope that ( for the actor 's sakes anyway ) there are some real gems on the cutting room floor . Sad for us but if that 's true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop . Oh yeah and another thing ... I wished for just once I could go see an American movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren 't absentmindedly and / or disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans , smashed CDs and , other such trash ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I recently picked up all three Robocop films in one box set , rather cheaply and the only reason I did this was for the special edition of the superb first one . I have seen Robocop 2 before but not for 17 years , the year it came out . I have never watched it since because I can still remember how disappointed I was when I discovered how appalling it really is . Its a complete mess really , it has all the signs of a troubled production with so many sub-plots going on at the same time . It has a very uneven tone also and it is also one of the nastiest films I have ever seen . I don 't mind a little violence , the first one was incredibly violent but this one is just plain nasty . Also the SFX is terrible even for 1990 , say hello to bad stop motion . Also having a drug dealing , cursing kid as a villain is just a little too much . Peter Weller at least had the common sense not to return for the next one . The only positive thing I can say for this film is it does have a couple of nice gags , like the thank you for not smoking one and the kiddie baseball team robbing an electrics store .

" " Let 's make a film that puts two chronically depressed , socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are !

First there was the science of creating the shark-man , which the movie barely touched on . In order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes . During one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead ( what fabulous special effects ) . Back to the science , I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue .

" GINGKO BED is a strange movie . It 's very convoluted , as if it had a lot of ideas but lacked the ability to bring them all into one coherent story .

Of note is the girlfriend and her troubles at the hospital . Was this ... interesting ? Then there were the " " we are spirits , thus we have no physicality " " elements , which leads to the same problem that people had with GHOST , namely : If the characters have no physicality ( i.e. no corporeal form ) and they can phase through walls and what not , how exactly do they keep from falling through the floor , or float up the ceiling for that matter ? GINGKO BED was highly touted as a new breed of South Korean film .

I have no idea how it won any awards , and although I 'm sure a great deal of effort went into making it it was all fruitless as the final outcome is one which screams of early 90 's foreign soap operas . The plot was non-existent , the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with an a-level performance . It was unfortunately long and the sub-plots were incredibly unrealistic .... for example .... if your best friend slept with your ex-boyfriend of 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken up you would not all remain the best of friends .

" Well , they sent it on TV between midnight and 2 : 00 am - it seems like the right time to watch it , and then go to bed afterwards ... No , it was not really living up to my expectations . I think the Dogma concept is good , because the film then gets closer to what 's really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and mood-making music out . But then again , this concept requires some interesting action between the characters.I cannot say , that I know King Lear ( the Shakespeare version ) very well , if I had known the play , I would probably have been able to predict much of the film.Well , a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display - and we certainly see some bad sides . Oh yes , the paint of civilisation and culture can be very thin , and behind this paint you may find an animal.If you then compare it with " " Italiensk for begyndere " " ( Italian for beginners ) or " " Mifunes sidste sang " " ( Mifune 's last song ) , you see the same but opposite thing : A crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more constructive way . And if you dare do , you may win.When the film had ended , I thought to myself : " " Oh that 's why I haven 't seen it before ... " " The film has its own beauty .

Technically the only thing that works is the photography ; otherwise , the camera is put in strange angles ( to make it more ' art-film ' ) and the whole film runs in a black and white atmosphere .

Randy Quaid plays the idiotic role as Cousin Eddie Johnson . Eddie is a brain dead person , who 's incapable of even the simplest tasks . He was fired because he was dumb as a brick , but the company he worked for was sorry for it so they sent him and his family on a vacation .

It 's so sad you ALMOST have to see it ... But don 't . The nightmares I have are far worse than any other nightmares you will ever have . Trust me ... I hate this movie so bad because of it 's acting , the humor , the " " jokes " " and the story . The only good thing was the nice scenery .

" First and foremost I wish to aim a big & mean middle-finger towards the Troma DVD-distribution crew , who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie 's pivot killer on the back of the cover ! The synopsis just randomly mentions who 's the person responsible for the massacre on graduation day , for Christ 's sake ! I don 't care how terrible or how predictable an 80 's slasher can be ; just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point ! So , a word of advise in case you also purchase the Troma double-feature containing " " Graduation Day " " and " " Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell " , " do not 혯 repeat DO NOT 혯 turn the box around and read the back ! Watching the film is already a painful experience , but reading the back would really spoil everything.Now , as for the actual the actual movie혚 Oh boy ! Personally I 'm a fan of the cinematic ' work ' of Herb Freed . Well actually , I don 't really know whether I should admire him혚or pity him ! All Herb 's films are pretty bad & amateurish , but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good intentions ! Unlike with " " Haunts " " and " " Beyond Evil " , " he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high-school slasher films . Just to offer a minimum of originality , all the victims in " " Graduation Day " " are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach George Michaels ( awesome name ! I guess Herb Freed is a fan of " " Wham ! " " ) . During the opening credits , we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field , moments after winning a 30 seconds running race . The debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team-members weren 't pushing her physical limits too much is raised , but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone he / she considers responsible for Laura 's death . What a demented little movie ! The script must be one of the most incoherent ones I ever beheld , with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words ! There 's a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin , others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes ! Herb concentrates on the ingeniousness & the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film ! For example , Laura 's sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death . Halfway through the movie , however , her character hardly appears in the movie anymore . Also , the girls ' stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well . Instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings , we 're served disco-dancing & roller-skating sequences and 혯 of course 혯 numerous images of unattractive 80 's chicks stripping their tops off . Despite being really bad , " " Graduation Day " " could count on a respectable cast ! Christopher George ( " " Grizzly " , " " " City of the Living Dead " " ) greatly stars as the demanding coach , Carmen Argenziano ( " " When a Stranger Calls " , " " " The Accused " " ) briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ( " " Dead & Buried " , " " " Dracula 's Dog " " ) has a very amusing part as the school 's stressed out principal . The teenage beauties on duty include Linnea Quigley and Vanna White . Heck , for some horror fans , the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count " " Graduation Day " " among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80 's .

" This is the single worst movie I have ever seen . I cannot express how bad it is . I honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to have the pain end . I recommend instead of seeing this movie , you bathe in acid then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all of the scars.I had such high expectations when I read the back of the DVD case , and when in the beginning it added that Jesus was following them I was so excited ... then by the end I wanted to kill myself . I mean a twenty-three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema ... JUST PAIN ! Monkeys could have done a better job editing this trash . At least they would have thrown feces and blurred some of the garbage . It would have made it better to have not seen any of the horror.It wasn 't that I didn 't get the jokes , it 's that they were not only not funny , they repeated themselves like twenty times . Apparently , something isn 't funny unless you see it like a million times.Do not under any circumstances see this . People have rated ' Manos the Hands of Fate ' as the worlds worst movie . I have seen that too and agree that it is bad ... but ALAS it is only the second worst . ' Fatty Drives the Bus ' is by far worse.This deserves all kind of harsh language , but I can 't write that here so just imagine I swore a whole bunch . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" As the film begins a narrator warns us THE SCREAMING SKULL is so terrifying you might die of fright--and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed . Well , I don 't think any one has died of fright from seeing this film , but a few may have died of boredom . THE SCREAMING SKULL is the sort of movie that makes Ed Wood look good.Very loosely based on the famous Francis Marion Crawford story , SKULL is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances . Once installed in his home , she is tormented by a half-wit gardener , a badly executed portrait , peacocks , and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot . And to her credit , actress Peggy Webber screams rather well.Unfortunately , her ability to do so is the high point of the film . The plot is pretty transparent , to say the least , and while the cast is actually okay , the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired you 'll be ready to run screaming yourself . True , the thing only runs about sixty-eight minutes , but it all feels a lot longer . Add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you are.There are films that are so bad they are fun to watch . It is true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few howlers--but the film drags so much I couldn 't work up more than an occasional giggle , and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from ennui . If it weren 't for Peggy Webber 's way with a scream , this would be the surefire cure for insomnia . Give it a miss.GFT , Amazon Reviewer , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though I felt so angry at what I saw . I felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible . Since I have lived in the UK I have come to love this country but this film depicts British young people in the worst way imaginable . There is nothing to be said but avoid it , it will make you angry and sick . The people involved should be ashamed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The ' 80 's were not very kind to one-time major star Charles Bronson . Starting with 1982 's " " Death Wish II " " and ending with this truly gruesome film from ' 89 , Bronson 's screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness . " " D.W. II " " left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of Bronson 's character 's daughter , ( a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail ) . " " 10 to Midnight " " was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards . Nothing redeeming about it . Other films like " " The Evil that Men Do " " and the remaining " " Death Wish " " films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge . I 'm not sure if the producers ( usually Pancho Kohner ) got a kick out of showing a weary looking , senior citizen-aged Bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what , but the shoddy craftsmanship ( and terrible scripts ) of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated . " " Kinjite " " -- the last of these films -- is fairly well-made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness . In this film Bronson : sodomizes a perverse john ; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch ; allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner ; makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things I 've thankfully forgotten . Also depicted is the gang-rape of a young Japanese girl ( fortunately , this was off-screen , though well-implied ) .What were people thinking when they made this film ? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films ? For anyone interested in his best movies , check out most of the films he made in the ' 60 's and ' 70 's like " " The Mechanic " , " " " Death Wish " , " " " From Noon til 3 " , " " " Once Upon a Time in the West " , " " " Red Sun " , " " " The Great Escape " , " " " The Magnificent Seven " , " " " Rider on the Rain " , " etc . , etc .... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The subject matter seems pretty dated today . Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe 's book ; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence .

His co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm.David Wallace , Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round out the game 's foursome . Support cast is made up of veteran actors like Murray Hamilton , Vera Miles , Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg.At this date , it seems lumbering and tame .

" Bo is Jane Parker , whose long-lost anthropologist father ( Richard Harris , in the worst role of a very inconsistent career ) is in Africa studying something or another . She tracks him down ( how ? ) and he tells her of the natives ' stories of a giant monster whose nightly howling can be heard throughout the jungle . Turns out to be the Ape Man himself ( Miles O 'Keeffe , who has the film 's best dialogue ) , who rescues her from bad guys and falls in love with her , leaving them just enough time in this agonizing two hours to romp naked while a horny monkey looks on and cheers . Normally I 'm very open-minded to varying opinions about any film , but this is the sole exception . This is the worst film ever made . If you don 't agree , you haven 't seen it .

" Don 't get me wrong : I enjoy art-house movies , low-budget flicks , character studies , and foreign movies . Unfortunately , I couldn 't enjoy this one -- glacial pacing , complete lack of plot , and characters that you can 't dislike enough to hate , but you can 't tolerate enough to like.For me , Distant was like watching the cutting-room floor footage of a reality show -- all of the scenes which were deemed too uninteresting which would normally not make the final cut , were the only scenes included . A camera in my apartment with two of my friends ambling around for hours does not an interesting movie make.Distant certainly makes the watcher feel that way -- long stretches of no dialogue ( nearly 10 minutes before the first word is spoken from the credits ) can be made to work ( 2001 comes to mind ) , but for me , something else compelling needs to happen to draw me in.If you 're the kind of watcher who can sit through a movie and be content with movie analysis , perhaps it will work for you .

" Well , what can be said about a " " horror comedy " " that features neither horror nor comedy ? There are no characters in the film , but much too many plot lines - all underdeveloped and mostly superfluous.The computer generated creatures look bad , a bit like Disney versions of oversized rats without a tail . The walking dead are the biggest rip-off apart from the title , the shall look like the dead in Landis ' movie , but are far removed . They just look like bad actors with abit of plastic and bull 's blood added.Two plot lines really showed some promise ( the love story and the " " company " " story ) , but failed as miserably as the director , the writers , the SFX department , the production and the actors . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Despite the acclaim on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed , this film was a disappointment . Yes , it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud , boredom and frustration of the grunt , but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that 's ALL there is to this movie . There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous . It 's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute . One of the best World War II films , " " Twelve O 'Clock High , " " has very little action . But it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension . The exception to " " The Story of G.I. Joe " " is a brief battle segment ( titled " " city under siege " " on the DVD ) which takes place in Italy . Admittedly it is one of the most fast-paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie . But alas , the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight . Another turn-off is Pvt. Dondaro , played by Wally Cassell , who is meant to be a " " romeo " " but comes off a pervert . By contrast , Sgt. Warnicki is a sympathetic , if flawed , man . As he says to Capt. Walker ( Mitchum ) when volunteering for another patrol : " " Every step forward is a step closer ... to home . " " But that last step 혯 one patrol too many 혯 drives him over the mental brink . Too bad the rest of the movie doesn 't do justice to some otherwise fine touches . As for Meredith 's portrayal of Pyle ... it is practically comatose . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels . The script , the acting , the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling . The costumes , sets and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly awful . In an odd way I actually enjoyed this film , once I had accepted that it wasn 't going to be any good . It seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor , when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise ( albeit not very believable ! ) , but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights , that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films .

" I 'm sick of the " " open mind " " argument . I 'm generally quite open-minded , but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be " " enjoyed . " " You know what , there is a reason so many people are disgusted by this . And just because someone out there isn 't doesn 't make it less so . There is , after all , a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust , and no amount of " " open mind " " or " " pushing the envelope " " should eliminate that feeling . Otherwise we 're no better than senseless living things.Back to the film . Another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men , which may be why men don 't like it . But just because it proves revolting for more men than would otherwise doesn 't make it great . Maybe men shouldn 't be turned on by what 's dominating the movie industry , but is the answer for women to do the same ? Maybe , if you don 't like movies , TV , and entertainment having so much sexual objectification of women , so much violence , don 't watch them.And if you 're a director , don 't make them.Otherwise , some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this " " movie " " happen in real life.Heck , some people seem to like it so much . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But I have to say , the previous version ( " " Beowulf & Grendel " , " starring Gerald Butler ) was far superior to this . That one was only a little disappointing . This one is a mess ! ! ! What bugged me most ? Was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason ( Human sacrifices ? Pointless love interest ? ) , or the bad CGI , or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting ? Even worse was the way they made beautiful Marina Sirtis look so horrible ! ! ! And lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow ? And why did they continually remind us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men , and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film . He was tossed around by both monsters he fought , relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon . Even when he slugged the arrogant prince , he didn 't knock him out . He was much too reliant on weapons . Beo-wimp is more like it . This was certainly not the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem ! I 'd like to end this on a positive note but I can 't really think of one offhand .

" The film starts well enough . It is a truly terrifying scene as a couple of fugitives on the run from the law tear apart an innocent family living in a secluded country cottage by killing the mother and father . The young daughter only manages to escape with the aid of a mysterious spectre , who kills the two aggressors while she covers in a downstairs cupboard . Then , we catch up with her 15 years later as a drug-addled student researching the supernatural , living with her promiscuous aunt and being looked after by a mysterious redhead . She has no real friends , was almost raped at a party and keeps having bizarre visions which no-one else can see . So yep , life is grand . Things get a lot more pleasant when she has a falling out with her mum 's sister , who is later found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 etched into her forehead . Hmm , I wonder who the police 's main suspect will be ? This is quickly followed by more deaths , all linked by their relation to our heroine having been on bad terms with them before their passing . Could she be the culprit , or perhaps the explanation could be something of a more ethereal nature ? Clue : If you think the former , you 've picked up the wrong movie from Blockbuster . Go back and get the correct one , short-sighted gimp.As I said , I was all ready to fast-forward to the good parts , safe in the knowledge that I wasn 't missing out on anything but a mediocre suspense potboiler . But the first ten minutes grabbed me , and I decided to give it a chance . I was quite pleasantly surprised : it certainly wasn 't a masterpiece but the acting was good enough and the script kept throwing up intriguing situations of which I looked forward to finding the solution to . Alas , 45 minutes in , I realised my attention start to wander during a long sequence where the main character is walking round a library , doing nothing . We then get a cheap scare , followed by quarter of an hour of goddledegook about the paranormal between her and her new hunk of a boyfriend . Things only got worse from there , as the promising beginning is thrown out the window as we get one unconvincing plot twist after another , followed by an ending so anti-climatic it 's like being promised the moon and ending up with a teeny weeny meteorite instead . Pathetic.If it was bad all the way through , it would have been far easier to swallow . The fact that it starts at a canter and barely ends with a whimper is not just disappointing , it is heartbreaking . How can something which began so promisingly end up being so formulaic ? I don 't know , and I don 't particularly care . I 'll just give the writer and director a bit of advice for next time : Don 't spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your screenplay , then 5 minutes finishing the rest . You tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as sloppily as you have here ... 3 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of the last surviving horror screen greats - Conrad Radzoff - dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with televised-before-death snippets of the great Conrad greeting you as you visit . Unfortunately for him and his captors , Conrad 's body is " " borrowed " " by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him , toast him , dance with him , laugh with and at him , and then put him to bed in a casket which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs . News of the missing body reaches Radzoff 's widow and her friend ( who happens to be proficient in the black arts ) and she holds some kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so he can , in his own words , get " " an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . " " Well , Frightmare is an interesting " " bad " " film . Sure , it is cheap . The sets look like they were borrowed ( which I am sure they were ) . The special effects and blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility . The acting is average to below average with a few exceptions . Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame is in tow , but really he does little in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead man 's body for kicks . None of the " " kids " " except the pretty girl playing Meg is any good . Nita Talbot plays the " " friend " " of the Radzoffs with withering interest . Also , look for the big - I mean big - guy that plays the policeman . That is Porky himself of Porkys fame . But thankfully for all of us , one performance does rise above the material . Ferdy Mayne , an oft overlooked actor from Germany who had Christopher Lee features and did star as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers , does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life . Conrad Radzoff in a bad human being in life , living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even dead ( obviously none of the swinging teens at that point ) . Mayne is able to look very regal , speak very elegantly , and convey menace with ease . If for no other reason , one should see Frightmare for his performance . I do ; however , believe that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff that they used Christopher Lee footage ( anyone have any thoughts ? ) . Anyway , one can guess what happens and it does indeed : Radzoff goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace . Again , the formula is trite and overused . The acting for the most part is anemic , and the direction oh so ridiculous . But Mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ineptitude . Definitely worth a little peek . Watching Mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" A man comes to the office of the psychiatric Dr. Sammael ( Joan Severance ) claiming to be the demon Asmodeus ( Kane Hodder ) , the torturer of the 13th level of the hell , and he would like to tell weird things . He tells that he had made a deal with Lucifer to become human again . He should knock-up his virgin sister Mary Elizabeth ( Alison Brie ) on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the Anti-Christ , and then he would escape from the pit and reborn . When Mary Elizabeth gets pregnant , her stressed and abusive sister Catherine ( Denise Crosby ) does not believe that she is virgin , but their father and former obstetrician Albert Martino ( James Callahan ) examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen . Meanwhile the Church discovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth 's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military Father Anthony ( Eddie Velez ) to spy Mary Elizabeth . She is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver , Lars ( Jorg Sirtl ) , who is the lover of her tenant and friend Jennifer ( Azalea Davila ) , and Jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their bloods , but she believes that she has nightmares . However during the ultrasound , she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy . But it is too late.The awful " " Born " " is a B-movie ( actually a Z-movie ) that believes that is a great movie . The result is a pretentious and disappointing production , with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction . The plot is a complete mess : there is a priest that is a hit-man and former soldier ; a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric ; a father that examines the virginity of his daughter ; two female-demons ( succubus ? ) that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes ; a character that is a slut , and only exists to expose her beautiful body . There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity . But the worst is the acting : the unknown lead actress Alison Brie is histrionic , with ridiculous voices and grimaces . Sorry , Ms. Alison Brie , but I hated your annoying performance . I have not recognized Joan Severance , who has a good performance , since I still had the image of her youth . Denise Crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody , she got older but she is still a good actress . I believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a B-movie , the story might have worked better and better .

" Because ' cruel ' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers . Where do you even begin ? In a spout of b * tchiness , I 'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie . Scratch that . Nearly does not belong in that sentence . I can 't think of even one character who was portrayed well . Although , in all fairness , it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way . Still , the girl who played Katherine ( whose name I purposefully don 't include - I 'm pretending she doesn 't exist ) remains one of the worst actors I 've ever seen , only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian . The story was God awful . It attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways . Pretty much every part of it was pointless - though I will admit ( grudgingly ) that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise . And the ending was at least slightly humorous .

" * * * REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS * * * I 'll make this review short and sweet . I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman . How bad could it be , right ? Well , it 's pretty bad . Justin Timberlake plays Pollack , a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edison 's Police Force . LL Cool J is Deed , a cop within the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T. ( First Response Assault Tactics ) . He 's teamed with an " " on-the-edge " " bad cop named Lazerov ( Dylan McDermott ) . In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed taking on some bank robbers , but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs . I don 't want to give to much away , but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs . Pollack , who works for Ashford ( Morgan Freeman ) goes to a trial involving Deeds & Lazerov . He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford , does some investigate that turns ugly . Wallace ( Kevin Spacey ) who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey 's performance are pretty lackluster . The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott . He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me . LL Cool J is terrible in this film . He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion . He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday . The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film . The ending is far from satisfying.Don 't waste your time with this film . I 'm putting it on Ebay this weekend . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Completely ridiculous " " period " " film is only a thin excuse for its extensive , graphic depiction of the heroine 's affair with " " the beast " , " a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women . That 's pretty much what he does , and the film 's depiction of the beast is really really awful ; it 's basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for a hard-on that squirts copious amounts of white liquid . For fans of fake animal porn , I guess maybe this is a real turn-on . I was amused , however , by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The premise of Cabin Fever starts like it MIGHT have something to offer . A group of college teens after finals ( in the fall ? ) goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virus.Unfortunately , the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop . Cabin Fever is little more than college kids looking for sex , booze , talking non-stop about nothing , and seeing how many F-bombs they can get into 1 : 40 minutes or however long this mess is.The kids act and react stupidly to everything around them . One of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs , so what does she do ? She keeps shaving her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds . The scene is little more than a gross out . In another scene , Rider Strong from " " Boy Meets World " " gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says " " Pancakes " " and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him . If you can figure out the reason for why the " " Pancakes " " kid was included , I 'd love to know . Anyway , Rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash his bitten hand in a most likely contaminated creek . Another kid likes to drop F-bombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels . Why ? Your guess is as good as mine ! Rider Strong is the ONLY kid with any recognition in this movie . He tries to calm people down in-between the yelling and screaming and F * * * Y * * ! bombs that people are throwing around . When the kids aren 't yelling , they are having or talking about sex or talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are EVEN MORE ( if that is possible ) idiotic than the kids ! The idiot cop with an IQ of 60 at best may be one of the WORST acting jobs I have ever seen in a movie . You talk about people not playing with a full deck , this dork doesn 't even know how to find the cards ! LOL ! I was like , " " Will you PLEASE shut up already ? ! " " He makes the kid actors look like geniuses ! The only part that I sort of liked was Rider 's scary story ( although gory ) about the deranged bowling alley guy . In interviews , Rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director Eli Roth . But the problem is that Mr. Roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore . There are far too many bad things about this movie for Mr. Roth to get any credit . I wish I could agree with Rider and find something likable about this movie . Maybe the fall scenery in the beginning ? Actually , Rider Strong JUST saves this movie from being a 1 ! Hopefully , he was compensated for this junk ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A sad , sad sight indeed is The Munster 's Revenge . The Munsters are brought back one last time ( Fred Gywnne received a huge paycheck to come back to the role of Herman Munster ) in this made-for-TV movie about a pair of wax replicas of Grandpa and Herman that are robots " " terrorizing " " the city as preparation for a robbery of a mummy 's stash at an exhibit . With the police on their heels , the two elderly television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes in order to clear their names . We get to see them dress in drag as waitresses ( a minor highpoint in the film ) , grandpa turns into a bat with attached wire a couple times ( one time even flying to Transylvania with Herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles I guess ) , and a most annoying relative " " the Phantom " " constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium ! What is most sad is hard to pinpoint : is it that Gywnne ( especially ) and Al Lewis look so haggard in every scene and so indifferent to the material . Is it the hokey costumes of the robots that have that school production values look about them . Maybe it is the ridiculous script . Sid Caesar 's crazy , mostly unfunny antics . Or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super K-Mart fashion makeover . At any even , the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for Munster standards . As for the rest of the cast , Yvonne De Carlo is adequate in a most vacuous role ( though showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her years and experience ) . K. C. Martell makes an ever-so-not affable Eddie Munster . Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn . Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner . The film has a real cheap feel about it even for a made-for-TV movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Loved the original story , had very high expectations for the film ( especially since Barker was raving about it in interviews ) , finally saw it and what can I say ? It was a total MESS ! The directing is all over the place , the acting was atrocious , the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat , empty and completely unnecessary ( whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast-forward-slow mo nonsense ? It was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo music video ) . Whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal , some are just ridiculously laughable ( the first kill on the Japanese girl was hilarious and Ted Raimi 's death was just stupidly funny ) . It just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense , totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more . No explanations were given whatsoever , I mean I knew what was happening only as i 'd read the story but for people who hadn 't it 's even more confusing as at times even i didn 't know where it was going and what it was trying to do- it was going on an insane tangent the whole time.God , I really wanted to like this film as i 'm a huge fan of Barker 's work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie , hell I even enjoyed some of Kitamura 's movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish- I didn 't care about anyone or anything , the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source , turning it into something else entirely . Granted it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a superb badass , but everything else was all over the place , more than disappointing . Gutted , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" GOLD RAIDERS ( 1951 ) A dull western / comedy feature with the Three Stooges ( including Shemp Howard at this point , who I 've always enjoyed as the " " third Stooge " " ) doing their usual schtick , and directed by the normally dependable Edward Bernds , who also did some of their funniest classic shorts -- so one has to wonder , just what went wrong this time ? The most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15-minute two-reeler comes up as too much for a 55-minute feature film . Unlike so many of their classic short subjects , GOLD RAIDERS is not worth revisiting . * 1 / 2 of * * * * , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is one of the worst movies I have seen recently . When a man says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to orally pleasure himself I pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of childish 14 year old male fantasies . The bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public . From the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting , how long its been since they got some , when their next sexual liaison will be , and with whom it should be with . On top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced , not felt , and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes . This could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here . Please , do not even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I thought this movie was terrible . I 'm Chinese , so I thought everything was totally wrong . Many of the facts were incorrect .

I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake . Many of the actors and actresses were not very great . Some of the jokes that were supposedly " " funny " " were really stupid . I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get . Disney has really got to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie . Mulan was quite accurate . Watch this movie if you want to waste some time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ziab la ta 'kol al lahem is an awful movie.This is only a superposition of scenes without a clear link.Acting is also very bad , despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El allayli . But something is really astonishing in this movie , talking about sexuality , emancipation of women , nude scenes are very rare in Arab cinema , even in this days . I really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage . We want to see more of this style in Egyptian movies , but with better quality . The reasons that led me to vote this film as an awful one are not only scenario and acting , but also the lack of prfessionalism . This movie look like an amateur one.We can see a lot of errors in the screen . If you want a good arab movie Ziab la ta 'kol al lahm is not the one recommended.But if you wish to encourage the uncensored movies in all the arab world watch it and make your friends and your family do the same . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" There is nothing original , humane or insightful in this film . The acting is average , images are amateurish , the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic ... something close to a soap.In 2 : 37 , a suicide is used to turn the film into a suspense drama . We watch , partly , because we want to know who dies . The various characters each have a problem , and the film shows how bad each problem is for them , but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves . Despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key events , there is NEVER another way of seeing the events themselves . So in 2 : 37 , the arseholes are arseholes , the angels are angels . This is simple stuff.Without this complexity , the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence . You hardly get to know the kids as much as the breasts , bodies and limps that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation.In the end , if you know ANYTHING about film in the last 5 years , 2 : 37 is just an immature rip off of Elephant - not a meditation , not a progression . Yet while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy , they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant . The positive posts on IMDb curiously avoid any mention of this , or simply don 't value originality . If you do want something with heart and voice - avoid this piece of youth exploitation . I was surprised by the filmmakers age when I found out after seeing this film - I had assumed a 13 year old had made it . The Twenty Somethings I 've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time . It 's dull , ponderous , badly acted , and teeth crawlingly pretentious.I watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold , before realising there wasn 't any . The shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful . These have to be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from Outer Space.The only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous ' demons ' wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket . How scary is that ? And I did like the moggys used as extras , I suppose they are least cheap . Though it did seem a bit obvious that they had been enticed into camera by the careful placement of some tuna.This film is so dreadful , it should have a public health warning .

I 'm told that when the movie premiered audiences laughed it off the screen .... and that was in the 50s when standards in special effects were much lower .

The amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background . The various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way ; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic . It just seems to drag on and on .

... " thankfully he hasn 't , yet ! This is crude , simplistic student politics made into drama . It needs the viewer to buy into a series of conceits . Conceit 1 : That a British electorate could be swung from being basically right of centre to being overwhelmingly far left . Conceit 2 : That all debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the new Prime Minister 's only critics are sinister civil servants , MI5 , big business and the Americans ( naturally ) . Conceit 3 : That this radical socialist PM can solve all union , economic and social problems with consummate ease in a way that unites the nation . Conceit 4 : That severing all ties with the US and NATO is a good thing . Conceit 5 : That the Soviet Union isn 't a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them back in the 80 's . And finally , Conceit 6 : That the reactionary forces of the US would actively seek to launch a coup d 'etat against Britain.It 's ludicrous and the show only gained the reputation that it did by trying to cash in on some anti-Thatcher feeling in the country and having left wing TV critics singing its praises . When it was made , television was still a hugely popular and influential medium with shows getting huge ratings so a widely talked about drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience .

" There are many reasons I 'm not a fan of fact based films , but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license over the story . If they have such great imaginations then why not use that talent to make something original ? Otherwise stick to the facts . This could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that . Ed Gein was an insanely frightening human being . It 's been said if you were to take Michael Myers , Jason Voorhees and Leatherface , wrap them into one person , Ed Gein would still be sicker / scarier . So why can 't someone make a movie about him that can convey this ? When will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction ? I 've read books and watched news programs about him and , now I 'm not a screenwriter or anything , but I believe there 's enough documentation on Gein that it shouldn 't take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented . I 'm aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and barn there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the deputy 's relationship with his Mother , and girlfriend as filler , and far too much of it.I guess what I 'm wondering is this ... why at the end of the movie did I know more about the supporting characters than I did about Ed Gein ? Why didn 't we get to know his Mother , Father and brother and the relationships between them ... what made him the psychopath he was ... what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became ? Instead , the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy ... running.In the end I give it 4 / 10 stars . Thats 2 for the gore and 2 for Kane Hodder . Even though it was kind of bad casting in my opinion , considering Gein was a smallish man , and possibly effeminate and Hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what I would consider feminine .

" One of the requirements of science fiction , at least before it starts to become satire , is that it be somewhat plausible . I would think that an anti-matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended . But I 'll leave that to the physicists who might have seen Solar Crisis.It is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand . They 're getting close to Earth , so much so that it 's become unseasonably hot , as if the entire Earth were Death Valley . The answer is an anti-matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there . That will divert the flares off in say the direction of say Mercury providing it 's not in direct alignment with the Earth . Who to deliver it , but captain Tim Matheson and his crew . That is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son , Corin Nemec . Taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral Charlton Heston , Matheson 's father , and Nemec 's grandfather.There 's a villain here too , Peter Boyle who is the CEO of a multi-national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world 's food supply for the survivors . The idea he might not survive doesn 't enter into his thinking . He 's doing his best to sabotage Matheson 's mission.Solar Crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001 , A Space Odyssey and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . Boyle seems to be taking his cue from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman , apparently he 's the only one in the cast who realizes he 's in a turkey and overacts accordingly.The rest of the cast are stalwart , true blue and dull . Except possibly desert rat Jack Palance who finds Nemec and cares for him . The key here is that the film was directed by that noted Hollywood purveyor of flop films , Allen Smithee .

" Why does C Thomas Howell do these movies ? Cruise ( Howell 's one time co-star ) does a huge blockbuster of WOTW and Howell follows with this lame effort.Where do I start here ? Production Values - I 'll start with the good stuff . The look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest . The set-ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad.Script - Terrible . A series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie . The amount of times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was uncountable . Very poor storyline ( but so was the Cruise WOTW ) takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off.Special FX - Okay , I don 't want to be too harsh here as I imagine the budget was smaller than Cruise 's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done . Some shots are quite impressive - mainly far off destruction shots of bridges , Washington , liner . But in the main the " " alien " " machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful . Also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others.Acting - I 'm a fan of Howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low-budget flicks - he has succumbed to the " " over-acting " " bug a long time ago . Look at his performance in The Hitcher and compare it to this movie . There is no comparison . He overdoes his facial expressions , his flailing arms and legs ( where did he get that running style ? ? ? ) and for a final coup-de-gras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family . Hysterical . But after saying all that - he is still the best actor on show here . Busey is embarrassing to look at and Peter Green ( Zed is truly dead now baby ) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene . I honestly could not understand one word he said - I even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene - but the DVD did not have subtitles . This seems to be a real keep-it-in-the-family affair too as Howell 's son , the director 's wife and the line producer all make it into the film . None of them are good.Direction - not bad but not good either.Score - Dismal.Overall , a lame duck effort that will do nothing for Howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time . He should take a look at Rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the A list but if he keeps doing stuff like this , he won 't have a career soon enough.3 / 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I read the reviews of Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye , I thought , " " Huh ? " . " It was THAT confusing . To be sure , I went to watch the film and what do you know ? It 's a remake of " " The Wedding Singer " . " Several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of Indianness , but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 Hollywood hit . Bollywood is no stranger to remakes , but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it . I groaned so much watching this and I realized I wasn 't the only one doing so ! One guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back ! Salman Khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles . He shrieks and whines too much . Why can 't he just take it easy ? He doesn 't do justice to the role originally acted out by Adam Sandler . He doesn 't have Sandler 's sense of comic timing . Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites , but she 's no Drew Barrymore either . The scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname ( " " Hi , I 'm Mrs Pugalia " " ) doesn 't match up to Barrymore 's version ( " " Hi , I 'm Mrs Julia Gulia " " ) .

I saw this film in a Sneak Preview , and left after half an Hour . Couldn 't stand it anymore . How can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are , and how perfect their lives are ......... ? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American G.I. , still wandering around in the Vietnamese jungle , who was not aware the war had ended . How he would suddenly pop up in the film , and would start emptying his M16 at the characters in the movie .

The two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end.There 's not a whole lot to this particular short . The direction is straight-forward and dramatic , which is good , the acting is sincere , but the story leaves a little bit to be desired . Why , exactly , do we care about these two people ? It 's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it 's much more pared down and doesn 't search for meaning in it ( a welcoming change of pace if anything ) .I don 't know , it 's possible I don 't connect to these stories because I 've never experienced them . But I have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same , i.e. , a couple talking together while avoiding eye-contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines , etc . The nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different , and I 'd like to see a different take.--PolarisDiB , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Who really wants to see that ? Disgusting violence , disgusting sex , for such a long time . I do not want to , but I always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be . This was the hardest ( right after " " Next Friday " " ) .It 's basically just crap . How can you possibly call it anything else ? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for gore and T & A. Yeah , yeah , " " Hey , it 's realistic , they have been like this . " " Fine , but why bother us with it ? I don 't care if it has been like this ( and there are a lot of scenes where I truly doubt it ) . The point is , why should anyone wanna see it ? Problem is , there is only one reason you could like the film and that would be that you like violence . There 's nothing special about it , just cruelty . You can say " " Cool ! " " as you 'd say in splatter-slasher-movie . But horror movies with violence at least can give you chills and excitement , maybe characters you care about . But here everything is dark , dull and boring . Every character is mad . " " The story of an emperor who can 't deal with his power " . " What ? In the very first scene he runs naked through the woods with his sister ! I have no problem saying that we saw a madman for 2 1 / 2 hours.But maybe you get turned on by seeing Helen Mirren , being pregnant and dancing . Or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the message of the movie . Or castration , yeah right , that was fun ! Real birth scenes , how hilarious ! Humans , animals , who cares , let 's just treat them as toys.I don 't care what anyone says , this is no movie , this is just 2 1 / 2 hours of blood and sex , degrading and disgusting . Go watch a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror flick if you want violence . At least those movies don 't pretend to be some artistic masterpiece . And they are shorter .

" It 's nothing more than a weird coincidence that I decided to watch STARLIFT on the 59th anniversary of the day in June 1950 when President Truman 's ordered US forces into the Korean War . STARLIFT , you see , is set largely at Travis Air Force base in California in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in Korea . But you 'd need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name ' Korea ' mentioned . We see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there 's no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured . Which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute America 's men in uniform . Released in December 1951 by Warner Brothers , STARLIFT is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studio 's star-studded World War Two home-front morale booster " " Hollywood Canteen . " " This 1944 crowd-pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in LA hoping to get a date with Joan Leslie . But really it was just an excuse for Warners to trot out every star under contract , from Joan Crawford , John Garfield , and Barbara Stanwyck to Peter Lorre , Bette Davis , Sydney Greenstreet and more . STARLIFT features two Air Force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet Nell Wayne ( a mask-like Janice Rule ) and persuading a bunch of Warner Bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops . But in place of Crawford , Garfield et al the best the brothers Warner could scrape up in 1951 were Doris Day , Ruth Roman , Gordon MacRae , Virginia Mayo , Gene Nelson and Phil Harris with fleeting appearances by James Cagney , Randolph Scott , and a clearly embarrassed looking Gary Cooper . This threadbare cast , whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp , is perfectly matched by the crummy production values . Presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection . How bad is it ? You can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage ! To describe STARLIFT as a sloppy , lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy , lazy and third rate . It 's just terrible . Avoid it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films ( Girl 6 , Donnie Brasco ) , and don 't really remember her , but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy.She really didn 't think what she was doing was wrong , even when she left the business and found her religion again.The photos she made were certainly tame by today 's standards , and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited , and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography .

" Times are tough for Angel Town , gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown ( Mainly due to embarrassing writing ) the gangs want a street kid , Martine to join the gangs , so they beat him up everyday . However due to the presence of an Olympic kick-boxer ( Olivier " " World 's lamest actor " " Gruner ) named Jacques , hope is on the way . Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made ( And I 've seen my share ) it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need , are French kick-boxers who can 't act . Worst of all there are so many awkward moments it 's just truly hilarious . Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is . To Wit : " " You like the fighting ? ( Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock ) I could kill him right ? When I want him dead he dies ! The reason why I don 't want him dead is because i 'm afraid of him , and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me , that 's why he doesn 't die ! " " Of course the fact that it 's wrong to kill someone , let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation . Odd.However don 't let me make this sound that I hated this movie , far from it , it 's so terrible it 's priceless . The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gang-members who ( the film 's biggest logic gap ) decline the use of pistols . Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs , while Gruner kick-boxes the rest . All of this set to the sound of horrible " " Mexican " " accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this.The other treat about this movie , is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite that 's the main reason he 's here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend ( In a graveyard in the film 's awkward beginning ) Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level , this is the perfect movie for you .

" I understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel . Deathstalker , The Throne of Fire , Barbarian Queen , Conquest , the Invincible Barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor . The primitive costumes , dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film , but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor CGI effects and colorless characters . Compare this film to Beowulf ( 1999 ) . It may not be Citizen Kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci-fi / adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is really goofy ! I saw it as an 11 year old , and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous ! I would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12 . I really didn 't care for it , but I do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of , such as : 1 ) Does money buy happiness ? 2 ) Should I lie ( to my parents ) about things I think they wouldn 't approve of ? 3 ) Does money buy friendships ? 4 ) Is money everything ? 5 ) Shouldn 't I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me ? Granted , these are very unrealistic situations , but I do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children , maybe they should watch this video as well , in order to show / scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First let me state that I do not believe in god ( if you want to use the word atheist , fine , but I don 't like that word since it describes what I 'm not , not what I am ) but I hated this " " documentary . " " The production values were damn near non existent , the premise extremely shaky and whole thing seemed to be an exercise in Brian Flemming 's insecurities.The production values were terrible and Brian Flemming is clearly an amateurish director at best . The narration sounded like he just narrated over the film all in one shot , and he didn 't practice at all . There were way to many umms and pauses when he should have been talking in the movie. animation was also pretty damn bad.The whole idea that Jesus is a mythical character is not taken seriously by historians and biblical scholars . As I stated before , I do not believe in God , and I don 't think that whether or not Jesus was a real man says nothing about the existence of God . My personal view , Jesus probably was a real man but he lived in a time where there were many massiah 's ( look up apollonius of tiana ) and that the stories of his life and preaching were blown out of proportion the farther you got from his death . According to the Wikipedia article on the historicity of Jesus ( and there 's a good citation for this so it 's garbage ) " " virtually all scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that Jesus was a Jewish teacher from Galilee who was regarded as a healer , was baptized by John the Baptist , was accused of sedition against the Roman Empire , and on the orders of Roman Governor Pontius Pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion . [ 1 ] " " I was left wondering at the end of the documentary if this was more about the director 's insecurities than anything else . I was left wondering if he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else . The most telling example of this is the final interview he was with the religious school principal . He 's not even coy about it . The way he bombards the teacher is unfair and while I agree with the director partially , that teaching kids about hell fire is a bad thing , the way that Flemming confronted the principal was just awkward to watch . Flemming had a chance to perhaps get a good discussion going , if he was more tactile with his interview . Instead he comes off aggressive with " " isn 't it bad to teach kids this stuff . " " The guy cuts the interview short and I mean , what did he expect , the principal to say " " oh yes , I see it is , I have seen the light , this will now be a secular school ? " " It seems that Flemming is getting revenge for what he feels was a wrong done to him in childhood . This isn 't about the documentary , this is about Flemming 's insecurities , and has nothing to do with the supposed topic of the documentary . Flemming shows what he 's really doing here , and that is the real downfall of this so-called documentary . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life , a lot , but this is without a doubt the worst one ever ! I usually like dumb movies , if they are somewhat entertaining , but I can 't even think of one good thing about this movie . I like " " Teen Witch " " for Heaven 's sake . But S.I.C.K. has horrible acting , lame porn music throughout the whole thing , and even the sex scenes sucked ! I would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of " " Twin Dragons " , " " " Puppet Master vs the Demonic Toys " " or even " " a Very Brady Sequel " .

" Absolutely one of the worst movies I 've seen in a long time ! It starts off badly and just deteriorates . Katherine Heigl is woefully miscast in a Lolita role and Leo Grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character . The only cast-member with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore , who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role . The script is dire , the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus through ! It is also the most sexist movie I have ever seen ! Katherine Heigl 's character is completely unsympathetic . She 's seen as an evil , wanton seductress who lures the poor , innocent married man to cheat on his wife . It is implied throughout the movie that she 's underage , and the message that accompanies that plot-strand just beggars belief ! At the end , she isn 't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who 's obviously ( ha ! ) become demented with rage and guilt , but the script allows him to kill himself , thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere .

" Dorothy Provine does the opposite here : She keeps growing and growing . I didn 't detect any subtext , though . " " The Incredible Shrinking Man " " and other movies of its ilk during the period were parables about radiation , nuclear war , and other horrors . Provine 's growth is the result of an inept computer / robot.And who operates this computer but Lou Costello ! I like some of his movies with Bud Abbott . But , though this is a pretty bad movie , he does fine without him . And Gale Green is an excellent foil.Green plays the pompous town big shot . He is Provine 's father . He is intent on being elected Mayor . So when his beloved daughter starts having issues , he dumps her . He doesn 't exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer Costello.This is pretty implausible : Costello is the local garbage collector.The special effects are minimal .

" This movie was not very good in my opinion . While not a complete waste of an hour and a half ( luckily I didn 't have to pay $ for it ) , it just wasn 't very scary . There were parts where I jumped and a few minimally violent / gory scenes , but overall only someone easily frightened would consider this movie scary.The overall writing and acting were very weak . The characters never evolved or grew as people . Even at the end , the lead guy , whatever his name was , didn 't man up and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute . The plot also had inconsistencies . The police officer who was killed was NOT murdered in the same way he died in the game . The girl October mentioned that in order to kill the evil demon lady you had to read something from the correct text . Funny how they never bothered to do that and still managed to escape . The Malcolm-in-the-Middle kid died in the game but didn 't die " " in real life . " " Also , making the game play by itself was very weak writing . It would have been okay for the brother 's death , just to get them playing again . But you are supposed to play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play again ... why do you even need the game ? If you like movies like the Ring and thing its scary and fun , watch this movie . If you know someone like that you can watch it with at laugh at , do it . If you like " " horror " " movies that make you laugh out loud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free , do it . Otherwise , stay far far away . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I kind of feel like a genius ; I feel like I 'm the only one who saw through this fake film . I watched it three times , once with commentary , and I found myself getting annoyed at all the close-ups , all the times the screen just blacks out , and worst of all , I feel the film never really resolves anything . Yes , the priest dies , but he didn 't really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much grief , or with himself . That and he was an idiot . If it weren 't for the commentary by Peter Cowie which explained not only the movie but the book it came from , I wouldn 't have been able to stomach it at all . I enjoy French movies , but this is one that was completely absurd.Diary of a Country Priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but , that alone cannot save this deadly dull tripe . Scene after scene of extreme close-ups where characters don 't say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do NOT make an interesting or relevant story . How this film ever became a classic is mind boggling : it reminds me more of The Emperor 's New Clothes.Yes , Claude Laydu 's performance is heartfelt and thought provoking , if you are a sadist , but this film left me feeling empty because overall it is a weak impression of the Catholic priesthood , which is an ignoble and inglorious institution of corruption . The young priest 's triumph over the countess 's pride is a weak scene but 90 % of the film will drag you down with its dreary introspection and window into the young priest 's melancholy thoughts . This priest doesn 't come across so much as being humble as he does just plain pitiful.Being that I don 't speak or understand French I was looking forward to doing the English SUBTITLE thing to help understand the film . Well , the English SUBTITLE is at times impossible to view / read and the text rolls by so quickly that there was much I could not read ( and I am not a particularly slow reader - I just finished Dostoyevsky in 3 days ) . I really wanted to like this film . I try out everything " " chosen " " by the Criterion Collection , and yet can not see why in many ways this one merits some sort of critical nod . However , I sat through this entire two hour film yearning to feel some sort of empathy for the main character , and it never materialized . He just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter .

" Peeew this stinks ! As everyone knows it 's based upon some Geico insurance commercials ; what no one knows is WHY ? ! Those commercials were amusing on first viewing at best ; hardly fodder for a series . ( The talking Geico gecko -- that 's another story . Now that would make for an intriguing series ! ) And why on earth did ABC -- as reported in the press -- actually agree to buy the cavemen character rights from Geico for this ? After all , the idea of cavemen struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to TV ; Phil Hartman had a recurring Saturday Night Live role as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer over a decade ago . And that 's how a concept like this works best -- as an occasional installment . But a regular series ? Fuhgeddaboudit . ( A 1960s series called " " It 's About Time " " also used the cavemen in the modern world concept . It lasted one season . ) One of the show 's directors , who was also responsible for the Geico commercials , was recently quoted as saying : " " We were so excited when we were shooting our commercials because we felt like we had something that was very unique and we had bigger stories to tell . " " Wrong.In the annals of bad TV , this is destined to take its place alongside 1972 's " " Me and the Chimp " " as one of the all-time worst . The lead actor in the embarrassing Chimp fiasco actually went into shame-by-association hiding after it was abruptly canceled .

" ALERT : This review contains major SPOILERS . Do not read on if you plan to see this film.Judging from the amount of votes this got ( my vote was the fifth one ) very few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is . Well , back in the late 1980s , professional wrestling was pretty decent . An all-woman 's federation called the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association opened . It was a great league , and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the roster . I always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of ring skill and acting ability . Unfortunately , the LPWA closed down in the early 90s , so it only seemed natural for someone with as much talent as Mimi to start an acting career , right ? But surely there was an alternative to stuff like this ? This movie is really bad . As it was going along , I kept comparing it to an underrated movie called ' Survivor Quest , ' only this film lacks everything that made ' Survivor Quest ' enjoyable.As I started the tape , I went to fast forward through the preview to get to the meat of the tape . At first , I wasn 't paying much attention , but then I realized that the preview was for a movie starring Mimi Lesseos . ' Oh , ' I thought , ' here 's another movie featuring Mimi to look for . ' But as the preview dragged on , I became aware that is was a preview for혚 . ' Beyond Fear ! ' You know you 're in trouble when the only preview at the beginning features the movie you are about to watch ! The plot of this thing is pretty standard . Lesseos plays an ex-kickboxer that is living with the guilt of injuring an opponent / friend , so she focuses herself on her second career which she shares with her friend Sammy : being a wilderness guide . On this particular occasion , she gets a troop of three couples . Two of the couples are just there to take up space . You think that one couple , a Caucasian husband and a Korean wife , will be explored , as an issue appears between them halfway through the film , but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the woods , which consistently scares the Korean wife . The joke is funny the first time you hear it , but it certainly isn 't by the ninth time they do it . The third couple is just painful to watch : it consists of Mr. and Mrs. Page . They trade insults back and forth , and Mr. Page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he 's not busy playing cruel jokes on his portly wife혚.just like your typical American couple ! Before the hike , Mr. Page is spying on two stupid guys and their prostitute . One of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out Mr. Page taped it . So begins the peril , as the two guys track the group on their trip , and we wait혚.and wait혚.and wait혚.and wait for them to finally do something . When they do , it 's a fiasco.You can 't blame the cast . They try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with . The main culprit is director Robert F. Lyons , who needs to go back to playing bit parts and stay out of the director 's chair . Lyons starts and stops scenes in such a sloppy , sudden matter that you start to think he was suffering from dyspepsia throughout the entire shoot . There 's even one incompetent moment when a broad daylight scene with the thugs is slipped between some nighttime scenes . Then there is the sound department . The music and background noise completely overpower the dialogue so that you have to move your ear right next to your television 's speaker . Don 't bump your head on the screen ! It isn 't worth it to hear the poorly written lines . Speaking of poor writing , Lesseos gets some of the credit there as co-writer . The few interesting developments between characters are often abandoned for shots of the thugs or bad practical jokes . Early on , Lesseos knocks out a thug with a switchblade knife , so not once do you think they are in any danger from the two stupid thugs . When the crooks finally get their rear ends kicked by Lesseos in a well done and long fight , our cast all have a huge laugh together , despite the fact that one of them has been shot and is bleeding everywhere . Yes , everyone is happy in the end . Everyone except the poor souls witnessing the film , wishing for the good old glory days when Mimi performed in the wrestling ring .

" After seeing Forever Hollywood , it would be natural to want to see a John Waters film . At least , one get to say that they have joined the legions of cinema cognoscenti who have experienced the unique cinematic stylings of perhaps the best known non-mainstream director .

" When I ordered this from Blockbuster 's website I had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was . Who knows ? Maybe I 'd forgotten to take my ADD meds that day . I do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon , donned in their late 70 's-style wide collars , bell-bottoms and feathered hair , I knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster.The first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning , trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe , forcing polyester and porno-quality music on the would-be viewer . From the opening scene with the poorly-done effects to the " " monsters " " from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of ' The Vagina Monologues ' .Throughout the film , the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear . The " " ship " " was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old VCR and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path . Of course if moved slower than Bob Barker 's impacted bowels , but it had menacing pencil-thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two ( with some assistance ) .Moving on ... As the weirdness and bell bottoms continue ... We found out that they 're caught in a " " Space Time Warp " . " How do we garner this little nugget of scientific information ? Because the oldest male lead tells his son that , in a more or less off-the-cuff fashion , like reminiscing about ' how you won the big game ' over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing Coca-Cola . Was pops a scientist ? Nope , but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and Einstein 's theories.The recording I watched on DVD was almost bootleg quality . The sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone , other than that , it was really , really , really bad . ( There 's not enough ' really 's ' to describe it , really ) .I know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics . I never saw this film on its original release , but even back then I think I would 've come to the same conclusion : bury this one quick . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow , how bad can it get . This was seriously bad . Not in terms of the gore - which was mainly laughable CGI - but in acting , atmosphere and direction.The story was dreadful - the character arc of the main lead was a total joke . Within a few nights of stalking Vinnie Jones , he starts to become ' haunted ' to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend . Um ... are all New York photographers this childish , suggestible and weak ? His character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever - and by the very end you 'll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable , and totally absurd twist his character takes.The gory moments were clearly just a weak , low-self-esteemed effort to jump onto the modern MTV style gore wagon - all cgi , blood yet no real emotion whatsoever . These parts were unintentionally funny - and distracting by their self-consciousness - wacky camera angles etc.Overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea . What could have had atmosphere ( until the stupid monsters at the end ) is ruined in favour of ' look at me 'style self-conscious directing . This film wasn 't made for and audience - it was made for a CV - a deeply selfish motive . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" So I 'm looking to rent a DVD and I come across this movie called ' End Game ' . It stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller . Well worth a look then . Or so I thought.Boy , was I wrong.End Game has just about the most ridiculous plot I have ever had the displeasure of enduring . Now being something of a whodunnit , I can 't really tear into it as I would like without ' ruining ' it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity . But questions such as ' Why has he / she / they done this ? ' , and ' Where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off ? ' are all too abundant following the film 's unintentionally hilarious conclusion.As for the acting - you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor 's realised that they 've made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie , and this then shows in their performance ? This is one of those . Accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed , irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison.Of course , this didn 't make it to the cinema , and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room ; it is appalling . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" We saw this in a bargain basket at the local Asda : 짙1.50 for the DVD. reading all the hype plastered all over the cover saying how " " hillarious " " it is , and it also had a really good , established cast , we thought this must a great film.So we bought , took it home , shoved it in the DVD player , sat back and waited for the funnies to begin ....... and waited ....... and waited ..... and waited a bit more.Some 90 minutes later , although it felt more like 3 hours , the credits rolled , and that was the end of that.What a letdown - even paying 짙1.50 seemed a con . God knows what Caine , Richardson and Gambon were thinking when they said ' yes ' to this tosh . And as for Moran : well much as I enjoyed Black Books , Shaun of the dead , and his comedy tours , I felt he was out of his depth in this film . He tried too hard playing for laughs , probably thinking that if retaining the characteristics from his Black Books character , would work here.Sadly it back-fired . The gags fell flat after awhile , and then he became just an irritation . Which is a shame because I believe given the right part he could be a very good film / character actor.Anyway , to sum up : the actors in The Actors , failed to Act ! ! ! * * / * * * * * , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This episode sucks.Over the past few years I have watched all episodes of " " Next Generation " " and " " Voyager " " and am now watching " " Enterprise " . " I am thoroughly enjoying this series . Until this episode . I stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment . It is more like an attempt at slapstick.It does not build the characters but throws them out on a limb - and leaves the audience gasping . It does little to build the series.Why this was ever allowed to go to air amazes me . Was it the writing ? Was it the directing ? Was it the producer ? We 'll probably never know.But one bad apple isn 't bad I suppose . I say that hoping it is only one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was a little to old for this show I was 6 when it first came out . First off when I was a young child there were a few children 's shows that were on sesame street which I did watch and learned from , but other than that there wasn 't much else . My Cousins were all born a few years after me 7 years was the first one more came latter . Barney was a very big part of what they watched . When I first saw this show I told my grandmother how it doesn 't teach anything just uses magic to fix everything . I was 9 at the time , how many 9 years old have any idea what is really going on with a TV show . More and more that I saw or heard what the teachings of Barney were the more and more I told people how bad the show was . The funny thing is my parents who had a young child in the mid to late 80 's which was me by the way . They agreed and said the same thing as I did . The sad thing about this is my cousins who are older now 13 and such still agree with what they saw . Its not cheating its creative , its not right to think differently than what someone tells you to . Its o.k to steal if the person wont find out or mind that it is gone . Lets be honest with ourselves , Barney is out to make money not teach children anything . The more flashy the program the more inclined children will be to watching it . Children are stupid not because they are not educated they just do not know any better , second Barney put on a show and parents bought it . I never believed that TV could affect people the way Barney does . If you have a young child read to them watch a show that teaches them numbers , do not let them get involved in this show . Barney is like smoking once is to much , smoke a few and your hooked let your kid watch this show they are hooked and one day their kids will watch the same crap and buy the same crap you bought , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER , GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE- Guess what ? It worked , I 'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this . Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true . Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us ! It was by far the worst movie I 've seen since Hollow Man . I generally avoid the crappy ones , but got sucked into this one . We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it , and his movie picking privileges have been revoked . There is nothing remotely funny about this movie ... even the " " adventures of dickman " " scene was sophomoric at best .. Color me p * * * ed . Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason ... no .. it just sucked . NEVER WATCH THIS ! for any reason whatsoever . Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny . That 's saying ALOT . Please for the love of all that is holy , if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie . It 's many things- stupid , pointless , and worthless to name a few . But the main thing it was aiming for : offensively funny- it failed miserably . Crash and burn .... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" H.G. Wells ' War of the Worlds by director David Michael Latt is a slightly less-than-average flick which isn 't too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with - only $ 1 million . For this budget , the production value wasn 't too bad - the best part of it is the visual effects ( I was thoroughly impressed with the CGI considering the budget ) and sound design . The less-then-stellar parts of this film are the story which is VERY prolonged at best ( but again I think this is because of the budget they had - they had to prolong certain scenes to create the feature length 97 minutes ) , the acting ( again it 's because the actors had no story to work with ) , very few exceptional camera shots , and the music . However , again , I can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a meager budget and still had good production value . Still you should , d see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of War of the Worlds CAN be made even with flaws . 4 out of 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This kind of storytelling is unacceptable The only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it 's got George Lucas behind it , and it has the words " " Star " " and " " Wars " " in its title . That is an insult to aspiring filmmakers , and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story , writing and acting , but did not get the credit . This is a travesty.First things first . The story . Anakin 's evolution ? There is none . Apart from a little make-up around the eyes , and a little yelling , there is none . He becomes young , stupid , cocky Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in a single blow . The only thing consistent about Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence , how good he was at almost everything he did , planning , fighting , you name it . The only consistent thing about Anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity . He even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness.What part of the Emperor Palpatine telling him legends of the Sith does not point to the Emperor being a Sith ? Unacceptable ! The fight scenes used too many digital doubles . Everyone 's flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make-believe doll house . Count Dooku , Emperor Palpatine , Anakin , Obi-Wan , almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around.In one specific fight scene , Obi-Wan and Anakin in the climactic battle , they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes , to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart . I realize the fights are choreographed , but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust.The writing was awful . All the dialogue was of tremendously low quality . The good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their lines , but that just wasn 't enough . I can 't say enough bad things about this film . Too much special effects , plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe , and absolutely no insights into any of the characters . This is the biggest mistake of this film : nothing new is offered . We know the rough picture of everything , all Lucas did was colour it in.We knew Anakin lost his limbs . We knew Luke and Leia are brother and sister , we knew Luke is Anakin 's son , we knew Obi-Wan and Yoda go to exile , we knew everything . Nothing new is offered in this film . If that 's all the fans wanted , then that 's fine , Lucas couldn 't have gone wrong.But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader , and he asks after Padme , and hears she is dead , he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams " " Nooooooooooooooooooooo . " " That scene screamed B-movie all the way , and I was half expecting Darth Vader to go " " DANGER WILL ROBINSON , DANGER " " at any time . That is what this is . A B-movie , disguised by a huge budget and a ultra-loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the Earth . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The movie is being televised as I write.I simply forgot how horrible an experience I had watching it in the cinema.The whole idea of the movie is flawed . The fact that intelligent Europeans and Americans stranded in the desert forget all concept of morals and civilization within a couple of days is laughable . The madness of Lord of the flies was longer in the making.Details that annoy are plenty . One is the single African god-like character that mysteriously survives the horrible climate and have done so for ages without losing his mind and he seems to have no supply-problems either . Ridiculous . So too is the rescue attempt from the tour guide , an Indiana Jones look-alike , whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death a 5 minute walk from the hut . Then there 's the choice of Lear , imposed onto the group by a guru-like joke of an artist . He reminded me of my hippie high school art teacher.The worst thing though is Levrings choice of Lear . Obviously is an intellectual brain-fart . How that ever was going to be an pass-time is never clear to me.Positives are few and far between . It 's a beautiful movie , but that 's never important.High school intellectualism . Weird for the sake of weird . It 's a complete waste of time unless you like thrashing useless art movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw " " Mirrormask " " last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.It is a film that is visually rich but with slow direction , poor plot line and 2-dimensional characterisation.I did , however , know this when I went in . I was willing to trust the two gentleman that I went with ( knowledgable comic buffs ) that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so they were . Unfortunately , inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict . Though , this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to screen and who are given charge of direction . The pace of the story is lost as the camera lovingly dwells on the pretty pictures.I would not have gone at all without that reassurance that the style of the film would be worth seeing . I have tried with Neil Gaiman 's work but am always left with the " " emperor 's new clothes " " feeling . I live in hope but last night was no exception.I do not think I can continue with an analysis of Gaiman 's work without losing the will to live . Read the rest of the comments and all his faults are eloquently described . I cannot comprehend , however , how he imagined that he had any understanding of the mind of a fifteen year old girl , Nor that what he had to say added anything to the sum total of human knowledge on growing up and assuming adult responsibility , or the changing relationship that a girl might have with her mother . These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly , stereotypically and with no depth of imagination . All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies . When I want a sermon , I 'll go to church , but I don 't want one from a movie . I don 't mind some supernatural themes , ( after all , religion is about as supernatural as you can get ! ) but this movie had so much preaching in it that I was really annoyed . The landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies . The bad guy even looked like he had horns . And what a silly ending : the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men , and that broke the spell . If only life were that simple .

" I thought there might be some level of worth to this movie , and sat through the whole thing . I can summarize by saying it left a bad taste in my mouth.The movie started out OK , I think the initial characterization of Herc was true to the myths . Both as a child and a young adult he started out pretty strong but not the brightest bulb . But later on he somehow transforms into a charismatic speaker beloved by all . Huh ? Other problem : terrible CGI . The satyr looked OK , but the rest of the critters just looked terrible , especially the hart , the phoniest looking beast in the movie . And how come Leelee Sobieski 's skin was sometimes golden , sometimes normal ? The worst part for me--and everyone should cringe at this--was the twelve labors of Hercules . Because the producers obviously didn 't want to cover all of them ; maybe they thought us primitive screw-heads watching this garbage couldn 't count that high . Instead of the TWELVE labors of Hercules , we got the FIVE labors of Hercules . Yes , the five labors ! WTF ? ! ? He did 't even finish the last one , so it was really the 4 1 / 2 labors ! Just terrible . I 'll take Hercules : The Legendary Journeys over this piece of crap any day of the week . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

My mother keeps a cassette of this film as a general threat to any film loving person who annoys her . Everything about it stinks.As such it is a true classic.Who gave it 10 / 10 ? Were you inadvertently watching a good film and accidentally voted for this one ? Everyone involved in the movie making process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film .

" I 've got to say , I 'm a big fan of these ' Last House on the Left ' rip-offs , even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high esteem by me ; but one of these sorts of films that I didn 't like much was Aldo Lado 's ' Night Train Murders ' , and unfortunately it would seem that trains and The Last House on the Left don 't mix , as Terror Express is another lacklustre rip-off . Something that this sort of film really needs is a resoundingly nasty lead character ; and while Terror Express offers up three potential candidates , not one of them steps up and becomes this villain , leaving the lacking in the most important area . It actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board . This leads the audience to believe that there is more in store , but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set . From there , the trio end up ' taking over ' the train and use their new found power to terrorise the guests and rape the women.It has to be said that there 's a fair amount of sleaze in this film , which will be pleasing to many viewers ; but there 's hardly any blood . Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes , and he may have gotten away with it too ; if he could film a brutal sex scene . The idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex , as the people that you would expect to be powerful and forceful seem all too keen to show their women a good time , and despite one very tame ' sandwich ' sequence , none of the sex is particularly interesting . Since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes , this becomes a massive problem . Films like this are often lacking in style , suspense and credibility ; but you know you 're watching a bad one when it 's boring you . As you might expect , none of the acting is up to anything ; and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish . The direction is lacking in style , and there 's very little tension or suspense ; making it difficult to care what is going to happen . Overall , this is a pretty crappy example of an exploitation film , and I can 't recommend it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a lotta things about women , the universe , the better life , the terrible solitude of the brilliant architect from Manhattan who severs all links with everyone , including his three years old child -which may seem irresponsible to some-Actually the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old school pal , which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the oasis in a desert movie.The scene with-the-father-who-left-home-when -I-was-a child has been told and told and TOLD.Of course it did not prevent the offspring from making his way of life.And when you see the hero 's wife 's attitude , you may think she must never have heard about woman 's lib.The best is the soundtrack which includes superb songs by Willie Nelson , Tom Waits or Bonnie Raitt ...

" I absolutely despise this film . I wanted to love it - I really wanted to . But man , oh man - they were SO off with Sara . And the father living was pretty cheesy . That 's straight out of the Shirley Temple film.I highly recommend THE BOOK . It is amazing . In the book , Sara is honorable and decent and she does the right thing ... BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT . She doesn 't have a spiteful bone in her body.In the film , she is mean-spirited and spiteful . She does little things to get back at Miss Minchin . In the book , Sara is above such things . She DOES stand up to Miss Minchin . She tells the truth and is not cowed by her . But she does not do the stupid , spiteful things that the Sara in the film does.It 's really rather unsettling to me that so many here say they loved the book and they love the movie . I can 't help but wonder ... did we read the same book ? The whole point of the book was personal responsibility , behaving with honor and integrity , ALWAYS telling the truth and facing adversity with calm and integrity.Sara has a happy ending in the book - not the ridiculous survival of her father , but the joining with his partner who has been searching for her . In the book , she is taken in by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and Becky . And Miss Minchin is NOT a chimney sweep - that part of the film really was stupid.To see all this praise for this wretched film is disturbing to me . We are praising a film that glorifies petty , spiteful behavior with a few tips of the hat to kindness ? Sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity . I don 't even recognize her in the film ... she 's not in it.Good thing Mrs. Burnett isn 't alive to see this horrid thing .

" I was unlucky enough to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival . Sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin . Being a devout fan of Lewis Carroll 's ' Alice ' books I was very excited about this movie 's premier , which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch . Normally I 'm enthusiastic about modern re-tellings if they are treated well . Usually it 's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story . Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion . The adaptation of the original 's characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying . It probably didn 't help that the actors weren 't very good either . Most performances were ridiculously over the top , which I assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script . I did not laugh once through out the duration of the film . All of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by . Really , the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet Alice , but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman 's work . Also , I 'd have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance-off was awful . It was with out a doubt the low point of the film.What a joke . Don 't see this movie .

This movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book . I can 't believe Disney could even get away with making such a cheap , basic rendition .

" In & Out made me want to vomit . I have never seen such a shameless film ! It seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyous , but has no idea how to say it . To me this was not a comedy , unless cruel , sick jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls for it . From what I saw , this film had four ( 4 ) major flaws starting with ( A ) Matt Dillion 's character as he announces to the world that is former teacher , Howard Brackett ( Kevin Kline ) is gay . Never mind how unbelievable it is that Matt Dillion character won an Oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack-up . But why would he say such a thing ? After all , this was never an issue with Howard 's students , his friends , family , nor his finace . Nobody . So why would he say something like it when it wasn 't true ? More to the point , why doesn 't the movie supply us with an answer as to why he said it ? The reason is because there is NO answer , and for the convenience of the plot none is provided . The second ( B ) flaw is with the fact the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is--the attraction and sexual relation to members of the same sex . In this movie , being gay is based on liking Barbara Streisand musicals and being passionate about literature . It 's all based on stereotypes ! Both of these flaws are met up again at that must-be-seen-to-be-believed graduation ceremony . Matt Dillion finds out about the commotion going on in that small town and the film looks poised to let us know what made him say such a thing . When he arrives to the ceremony , he says nothing , and I wondered why in the world he then came there at all . He didn 't solve anything . Then when all of the audience stood to announce they were gay , I was so moved I wanted to throw up ! Those folks were standing up in defense of Howard being gay by mocking all of those stereotypes . What the film forgot is that it was using those stereotypes to show why Howard was gay . They filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot ! But wait there 's more ! During the ceremony , ( C ) Howard appeared to be on trial to lose is job as a teacher , because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay . What the film was trying to say is that homosexuals NEVER recruit , and that he wouldn 't influence his students . But did we not see Tom Selleck 's character endlessly pressure Howard over and over again , even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly , to come out of the closet when , in my mind , there was no closet to come out of ? From that , the film clearly show that homosexual are capable of recruiting . The film , again , then shoots itself in the foot.And ( D ) when Howard came out of the closet , did anyone not notice how the screenplay shut him up for the rest of the film ? I counted only three lines he had afterwards : " " Yup ! " " to his parents , " " Hi there ! " " to a student , and " " Are you ready ? " " to Tom Selleck before the last vomitous scene . I might be low by one , but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay . I wanted to know what was in his head , because I never for once believed he was gay.As bonuses , the movie also includes several truly offensive scenes . One in which Howard is asking a priest in confession for advice about what to do for a friend ( him ) , who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiance . " " Does that make him gay ? " " he asks . The priest responsed " " Oh yes , he 's definitely gay " . " Uh-huh . Or what about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered around telling Howard 's mother that she doesn 't need to be sad about her son 's deep , dark secret because , well ... everyone has them . Then one the ladies confessed that she 's never seen " " The Bridges of Madison County " . " Funny ? No ! Becuase the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how devestating it can be to family to have one of its members announced that he / she is gay . I know . I have several friends that are gay , and none of their families took it well at all . That was a poor way to diffuse the whole situation.The last straw for me was the last scene that gave they appearence that Tom and Kevin were getting married . The camera panned down very slowly to the front of the church when ... It wasn 't what you thought ! I had been thoroughly disgusted by that point , and I never could forgive that sick joke . I have nothing against films about being gay or homosexuality . " " Philadelphia " " and " " Longtime Companion " " were very honest and true in what they had to say . " " In & Out " " is just screaming for political correctness , but has no idea of the corruption at its core. what I gathered from the film is that if you are 99 % straight and 1 % gay , meaning if you have the slightless doubt , YOU ARE DEFINITELY GAY . It 's like gayness is becoming a dominant trait in genetics . In reality if everyone told you over and over that you were worthless and stupid , you would eventually believe it too , wouldn 't you ? This is what happened to Howard Brackett about being gay . I left the theater sad and angry . Angry the whole weekend , in fact . This was a seriously sick and cruel film , the WORST of 1997 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look , so when I saw it on the shelves in DVD I thought " " time to watch it " . " Big mistake ! A long list of stars cannot save this turkey , surely one of the worst movies ever . An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented . Perhaps it would have made more sense if I 'd read Robbins ' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel , and with Robbins assisting in the screenplay I doubt it , the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well.I hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately DVD blanks , take for example Pat Morita . Even Thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times.Save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile , like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer . Even when you see it in the " " under $ 5 " " throw-away bin at your local store , resist the urge ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This had all the makings of a very good film -- good actors ( Robert Loggia , Ellen Parker ) , a good plot ( mysterious missile from space threatens to burn up the planet ) and lots of stock footage ( if the Air Force had film of jets firing rockets , it was used ) . Unfortunately , it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible time-line.The movie concerns a missile from space that is attacked by the Soviets and inadvertently diverted into a low atmospheric orbit . At under five miles and at a speed in excess of 4,000 miles , it emits an exhaust of a million degrees , burning up everything on the ground , including glaciers , Distant Early Warning ( DEW ) line bases and Eskimos.Every attempt at destroying the missile fails.The first flaws in this film appear early on . While we don 't expect much from low-budget films , some things can 't be forgotten -- like a little research . For instance , both the Soviets and the US fire anti-ballistic missiles that home in on the missile with unerring accuracy . However , the first successful ABM tests weren 't done until March of 1961 by the Russians.There is too much melodrama . Dr. Loring ( Loggia ) and his assistant Joan Woods ( Ellen Parker ) play their romance with about as much wood as a log cabin . Parker 's character cries and boo-hoos at Loggia 's sacrifice like she was at a screen test . Loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman . A scientist ( Phillip Pine ) hams it up so much he makes William Shatner look like a thespian . A bus driver continually spits out end-of-the-world crap in scene after scene . The only good actor is the film narrator , played by veteran character actor Lawrence Dobkins ( " " Naked City " " ) .All of this could be overlooked if it wasn 't for the time-line . After the missile 's info is sent to DC , the Pentagon brings in a group of scientists . A general ( Larry Kerr ) announces that the missile will hit New York City in 63 minutes . After this , there are discussions by scientists and there is a deadly lull as word is sought from ambassadors to see if the missile is an attack from the Russians and if a response is necessary.The film shows the military being fully scrambled . Civil Defense people leave work and go to their stations . Eight million people scramble to fallout shelters while school buses pick up millions of kids ( and we get to see the whitest New York City I 've ever seen , though watching 50 's sci-fi films made it seems like this was the standard ) . The press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes . Then , incredibly , a man at the Pentagon announces that the missile will hit Ottawa , Canada in 51 minutes ! All of the aforementioned action happened in 12 minutes ! Then , to add fuel to the fire , Loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile . He slowly produces a caseload of plutonium , loads it in a jeep and takes it from DC to a distant missile base to put it atop a missile . Along the way , he is knocked off the road by a wild driver , breaks down and then is carjacked . He finally gets the plutonium back and drives to the base to arm the missile . Again , all this in the same 63-minute time frame.The movie also irks the viewer by making it seem as if Ottawa might be saved , only to show men , women and children get roasted . The missile is then said to have five minutes to reach New York . Loggia is still driving to the base ( 4 more miles to go ) . He gets to the base and arms the missile , a two-minute countdown is then announced . All within five minutes . The boroughs of New York should have been at least scorched.By the way , the missile is destroyed if you haven 't guessed . The ABM warhead destroys it with a massive plutonium-based nuclear blast . Five seconds later , the blast dissipates and all is clear . Yeah , they caused a nuclear blast equivalent to 100 Hiroshimas on the outskirts of New York City and nothing happens.The film had all the elements necessary to be a good B film , but wasted them . Loggia played his character so lamely you didn 't care that he sacrificed himself in the end . You didn 't care about the other characters , not even the smarmy scientist played by Pine . The tension that should have moved the film along just wasn 't physically possible in the time-line allowed ( it still wouldn 't be today , not even with Jack Bauer ) .This film is very difficult to find . As far as I know , it hasn 't been re-issued on any medium and for good reason . I don 't know if the film meant to be or if it was standard practice , but there 's a scene where the government sends all of the best scientists , military men and businessmen into deep shelters , saying they 're too valuable to lose . There isn 't a single woman or minority in the bunch . Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and he gets a brief bit playing a piano . It was worse than " " 27 Days " " where an alien gives five Earthlings the chance to either save or destroy the planet and he doesn 't include any blacks or Hispanics.I saw this on a special Sci-fi night on Turner Classic Movies and I don 't expect it to show up again . If you do find a copy of this somewhere , you might want to put it up on Amazon.com. , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is a lot like the movie Hostel , except with * BAD * acting and not much suspense . The gore elements are there , but you don 't really feel anything for the characters , making the violence not very effective . Some parts are just strange ... like forcing a snake down someones throat . What 's up with that ? Is that supposed to be scary or gory ? It 's just kind of stupid . As for torture , there really isn 't any ( except for the guy getting blow-torched in the beginning , which they don 't show anyway ) . The main bad guy keeps saying " " make them die slowly " , " yet the butcher kills them all very fast . The deaths are all relatively quick . Yes , I did watch the " " unrated " " version . So , overall , not the worst gore movie I 've seen , but not at all good either . You won 't miss anything if you skip this one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is horrible ! It rivals " " Ishtar " " in the number of embarrassingly bad moments .

" To summarize this movie : Without a real plot , this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes . The music is just awful , the humor isn 't funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks . It seems to me , that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy , who thinks that drinking is cool , women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks . Also , the movie has nothing to do with the original American Pie movies , other than a few names and Mr. Levenstein who is a minor character in this one . The only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls . Don 't watch this movie and don 't be fooled by the 5.4 rating , because it obviously overrated and doesn 't deserve anything above 2 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Mr. Bean is just a bunch of unfunny slapstick humour . It is the most shallow humour TV series ever made in history . The scenes are often disgusting and the horrible canned laughter sends chills through the spine . Mr. bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only sympathies how pathetic he is . It is incredible that such a TV series of low quality can be sustained for 5 years . It is a complete waste of time to watch even 1 episode and one can 't help but to express disgust and pity why Rowen had portrayed himself as such a 2-dimensional , unfunny and ridiculous character .

To say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement . Frankly I am lost for words to describe this utter tripe . Not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality ( this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of ' serial killer flicks ' ) but the acting was dire . For those who pay to see this , I hope you get your money back , for those who were paid to do this , I hope you GIVE your money back .

" Jean-Marc Barr ( Being Light , The big blue , Dogville ) has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy . I might be wrong but I don 't think this movie 's part of the Dogma ' 95 manifesto , though it really looks like it . I 'm not really sure of what I think about this film . All actors are good . They deliver pretty good performances , especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr . The story is somehow interesting . But I don 't know , there 's something about the movie that I don 't like . The sex scenes are way too long . It goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap I don 't know exactly where it stands . Sure it 's not a bad movie , but I won 't suggest people to see it neither I 'll tell them not to watch . Just do as you want . If you feel curious and you 're open-minded , give it a try , you might like it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
There was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack who directed this needs to learn his craft . All his characters in this movie were so unlikable and I could care less . The best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long shower after this cause I felt so damn dirty that I wasted money on this stinking load . Hey genius .... triads and yakuza are from two different places learn something about Asian culture . The dog scene in this felt so tacked on and useless . This DVD does prove useful I do love my new coaster.So kids don 't waste your cash on this crap buy Hostel instead . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996 . I remember I was already familiar with Elijah Wood 's work ( that 's right , he made stuff before " " Lord of the Rings " " ! ) and the merchandising tie-ins to the film were pretty abundant ( " " Flipper " " water guns were even circulating ) .Adults were reminded of the old movies and TV show and for nostalgia 's sake took their kids to see it , who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy.Unfortunately it wasn 't what anyone expected and flopped severely . You know a movie 's in trouble when a boy swims away from a Hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean , and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away , and the kid -- instead of getting out of the water into a boat -- floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he hasn 't taken into mind that the shark is still out there , perhaps even below him.Another problem is Paul Hogan . He looks old , crusty and tired of recycling his Croc Dundee shtick . By now , no one even remembered " " Crocodile Dundee " " much less Hogan , and I half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn 't know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fish-out-of-water / social-satire laughs.All in all this is a really poor " " family " " movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times . I hated it when I saw it in theaters back in ' 96 and I hate it more now . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I think its time for Seagal to go quietly into the night . What I have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90 's smash hits in comparison.A secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human 's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something . Somehow Seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world ... or something . Seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans , every time I look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well I know Steven 's athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him ? Usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close . Like I said , it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting . The problem was it wasn 't really scary and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old 280 lb Seagal killed them all singlehandedly ? I guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits ask Seagal to come to the strip club with them.2 out of 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads . After all , Feierstein 's Flex Crush will have you know that Real Men don 't watch anything by Truffaut . It might have been interesting if Truffaut had anything to -say- here . The camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new . Have we all forgotten De Sica 's " " Bicycle Thief " " ? Or anything by Hitchcock ? So all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as Truffaut , who spends all his free time ' screwing up his eyes ' at the movies , who wrecks schoolroom discipline , gets accused of plagiarism ( the many petty thefts ) , and ultimately escapes societal confines to make ' his own movie ' .

" A man is pulled off a London Street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect . Dull , banal film bored the hell out of me . More an idea then a film . I was half way into this 77 minute film when I realized I had no idea who anyone on screen was . It was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character . Certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center , there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough . Its not . And while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it , especially if one has seen the other , better films of a similar ilk ( rendition with Reese Witherspoon for example ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on Babbage 's difference engine whilst my schoolmates were playing football etc .. So , if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film , then I guess I 'd probably be included in that.Maybe I just need to watch it again . A previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired . Maybe that was my mistake.I tried my best to enjoy this film , and there are aspects of it that I do like , but overall I found it amateurish and quite plodding.Being somewhat of a self confessed computer nerd , I just can 't help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made , and how the employed graphics reflect that time ( i.e. 1997 ) . Having played games of the era c.f. " " Mind Grind " " to cite one example , this film cannot escape that 16-bit colour low res multimedia explosion of that time . Now thankfully this has somewhat lessened in more recent years in the gaming world at least , in favour of actual game play.Having to resort to watching this movie via a German FTA satellite channel ( as I don 't think it 's ever been aired on UK FTA TV , well not recently anyway ) , I was mildly amused to see the end credits note Gottdog ( God dog ) had 4 people working on it 's design . Maybe it 's mean spirited of me to be amused by this , given that ten years have elapsed since the movie was made , nevertheless the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparison.But , as for the main story , I agree that the format isn 't the best idea . Like others I agree that Ada deserves a film without the sci-fi angle , and a more straightforward biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable lady.There are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie . First of all the underlying idea that somehow lost real-world information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some sort of extrapolation via software based intelligent agents , seems somehow ludicrous.Also , the theme running through the movie that a computing device can indeed predict the mechanics of all things through the course of time ( e.g. the winds ) is now known not to be the case.OK , so the Victorians may have held this view , but the 20th century works of G철del proving that no mathematical system can be complete , Turing 's works on the limits of computability , not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics , have all completely undermined these ideas , which seem central to how the modern day researcher 's software is supposed to work.Finally , the clicking of the mouse in the air to mean " " programming " " is also just plain wrong , as previously mentioned.This film maybe could have been OK , but at least some technical and scientific consultation would have given the film some much needed credit in the believability stakes.I won 't forget the film though , as like " " Pi " , " it is clearly a unique work , but with too many fatal mistakes for me to truly enjoy it , 3 / 10 from me . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" You would think that a film that starred three of the biggest male film stars of the post World War II era would have become a classic . These three who also happen to be three favorites of mine , walk around in a daze , looking like they 'd rather be any place , but there.The sad thing is that The Way West definitely had some potential to be a classic . In these days of political correctness , a film about American pioneers and the travails of their westward migration is something not done now . It should have been better done back then.Kirk Douglas is a former United States Senator who 's heading a wagon train west to build a settlement in Oregon 's Willamette Valley . Being he 's an ex-politician , he rates above the hoi ploi he 's leading . The script calls for him to have not only a covered wagon , but a carriage to lead the train.You think that 's ludicrous , you ought to see the whipping scene where Douglas orders his black servant , played by Roy Glenn to whip him . I won 't spoil it by saying what causes Douglas to demand this of Glenn , but trust me , it 's bad.Robert Mitchum is the trail guide and of the three stars he looks the most bored . There was supposed to be considerable friction on the set between Widmark and Douglas , but Mitchum just saunters through the film above it all.Maybe the friction helped somewhat because the movie calls for Douglas , a widower , to have an eye on Mrs. Widmark , played by Lola Albright . Now she 's the best looking thing in the movie.The film billing says introducing Sally Field . This was made in between her Gidget and her Flying Nun days . She plays a piece of white southern trash with the musical comedy name of Mercy McBee . We first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents wagon , legs akimbo and inviting . Of course she gets taken up on her invitation.Her character is something like what 's found in every trailer park in America and then again what was a wagon train , but one large trailer park on the move . Despite this film , Sally Field went on to a two Oscar career . What that woman had to overcome.Victor McLaglen 's son Andrew directed this item and together with a lousy script turned this into a turgid mess .

" " " Jefferson in Paris " " is a truly confounding film . It presents Thomas Jefferson ( Nick Nolte ) in the most unflattering light possible , painting him as a liar , racist and pedophile , yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins . This is the way he was , the film seems to say . End of sentence , end of movie , the door 's behind you.After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy ( Gwenyth Paltrow ) , Jefferson proceeds to win the heart of Maria Cosway ( Greta Scacchi ) , the wife of a homosexual English painter ( the criminally underused Simon Callow ) . A turn of events sends Maria to England , however , and Jefferson proceeds to forget her with astonishing speed for a man who , mere minutes of screen time before , was asking her to live with him in America.He 's been bewitched , you see , by Sally Hemmings ( Thandie Newton ) , one of his slaves just arrived from America . Just why he 's bewitched is hard to tell--although Sally is undeniably beautiful , she acts like a simple-minded child in front of Jefferson . When she isn 't telling ghost stories in exaggerated " " darky " " speech patterns , she 's slinking around his bedroom , practically oozing lust for her distinguished massa.If her behavior is an attempt to excuse Jefferson 's , it doesn 't work . Jefferson damns himself further when Maria , tired of waiting for his letters , travels from England to see him . I 've not changed toward you , he insists , offering weak excuses for not writing . To her credit , Maria sees through his brazen lies immediately . When Sally appears , and she and Jefferson flirt openly ( and cruelly , to my mind ) in Maria 's very presence , the illusion falls apart completely.No one today believes that Jefferson , Washington and the rest were utter paragons of virtue and morality . Yet , are we supposed to believe that the learned , distinguished Jefferson would be attracted to Sally , a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how " " massa 's Frenchie friends don ' unnastan ' aw corn " " and who rubs herself against his front as she passes , right before Maria 's eyes ? Even if we let that slide , it 's followed by the horrifying revelation that Sally was only 15 when this affair took place ( Jefferson was 41 ) . Strangely , this fact comes out only toward the very end , when Sally 's brother James is understandbly furious at her blase announcement that she is carrying Jefferson 's child.Jefferson is equally blase when told that Sally is carrying his child , and patronizingly tells her that she 'd be far better off under his protection than free and living in France with her brother . But , he promises , I 'll free her when I die and our children ( including any more that come , Jefferson says , in a chilling declaration of Sally as * his * ) when they reach 21 . Oh thank you , massa , you feel like telling the screen . Big deal.The worst scene is still to come , however , involving Jefferson 's daughter Patsy . She is already angry at him , first for breaking his vow , made to her mother on her deathbed , not to marry again . ( Obviously the woman wasn 't just talking about matrimony . ) Jefferson has also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun as she wishes , despite earlier moralizing about freedom of religion ( that seems to mean freedom to agree with him ) .Having promised Sally and her brother their freedom , Jefferson calls in Patsy to witness the bargain and promise to fulfill it should anything happen to him . Sally 's brother blurts out the impending birth of the child , and Jefferson asks , " " do you swear ? " " Paltrow 's performance in this scene is brilliant , although she has almost nothing to say . Her face nearly contorts in agonizing pain at this revelation , yet she controls her grief and whispers yes.If anything , and the filmmakers could have had something if they 'd emphasized this point more , " " Jefferson in Paris " " is an indication of the status of woman in the late 18th century , viewed even by men like Jefferson as attractive property , pleasing but without true intellect or souls . We see Jefferson shed a few tears over a letter from Maria , obviously telling him where to get off , but he 's soon laughing away at a wild dance from Sally , complete with tossed hair and heaving bosom.I don 't know whether this is an accurate portrait of Jefferson or not . I don 't care to watch it , however , just for the sake of watching it . This Jefferson is no hero or even an anti-hero . He 's a selfish , lying child-molestor--and one who gets away with it--not the kind of man I want to see a movie about . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

BAD actors , and a really bad story . There 's no normal reactions to any event in this film , and even though it 's Halloween , normal people would have bigger reactions when they 're witnessing their father being killed , not to mention gutted , people with tape covering their airways , not being able to breathe ( in a room with at least 50 people I might add ) and some person dressed up as Satan dragging dead people out of his house , even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person . Not to mention the fact that no one could possibly be that naive and dumb to believe the reality of Satan and Jesus ' appearances on the same day , like this kid does . When i was 8 , I sure had more brains than that . But , the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling for this mute Satan look-alike as well , no questions asked . The question throughout the film is , is it really Satan , or is it some crazy person killing people off whenever he feels like it ? Well , he 's got human hands , arms , built and whatever , so I guess he 's supposed to be in the movie as well , otherwise they did a lousy job concealing it . Then , with this person being human and all , he was able to kill an old lady , a man and his mistress , 5 ( ! ! ? ? ? ) cops ( all with guns and training i presume ) , and a few other people ..... and obviously everyone was just standing there waiting for him , or what ?

" From the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible HERCULES ( 1983 ) , comes its even more preposterous ( read goofier ) sequel : right off the bat , we get another unwieldy " " beginning of time " " prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film ! ; a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a SUPERMAN-like scrolling credits sequence . Narrative-wise , here we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus ' seven all-important ( but poorly animated ) thunderbolts 혯 a crime which , for one thing , sets the moon careening on a collision course with Planet Earth ! Faster than you can say " " nepotism " , " Zeus ( once again played as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli ) sends his champion 혯 who has now rightfully taken his place among the elite thanks to , one presumes , the almighty tasks performed in the first film 혯 to find his blooming thunderbolts and avert the calamities in store.No sooner has Hercules ( Lou Ferrigno 혯 as if you didn 't know ) touched the earthly surface that he comes in contact with two attractive damsels ( Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani ) in need of his getting them out of distress ! ; the former ( who would go on to become an Italian TV personality ) seemingly has the ability to talk with the Little People ( ! ) 혯 which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from GODZILLA VS . MOTHRA ( 1964 ) ! ! Just so they can swindle as much unutilzed footage from the first film as is humanly possible , the divine quartet of villains resurrect good ol ' King Minos ( William Berger again ) from his skeletal slumber and pit him once more against his eternal enemy . Typically , Hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly foes including a Gorgon 혯 an awfully underproduced sequence which ought to have led to a surefire plagiarism suit had the film-makers behind the much superior CLASH OF THE TITANS ( 1981 ) bothered to watch this flick ( complete with the same " " reflection in a shield " " come-uppance and preceded by the muscleman letting the audience in on his tactics before executing them as if to show us how clever he is ) ! ! And just to make it crystal clear that he wears his influences on his sleeve , Cozzi has Hercules and Minos turn into a cosmic version of " " King Kong vs. Godzilla " " for one of their battles and later still , King Kong gets to grips with a large snake , an encounter lifted straight out of the classic 1933 original . I swear it : this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth ! As had been the case with the first film , the cast is full of old reliables like the afore-mentioned Berger , Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini ( as a sorcerer with a truly bad hair day ) and up-and-coming starlets 혯 not just Carlucci but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio ( as a younger Hera ! ) , Serena Grandi , Pamela Prati and , once again , Eva Robbins ( whose costume here easily outcamps her appearance in the first film ) ; for what it 's worth , Pino Donaggio 's score for this one is recycled from musical cues featured in his soundtrack for the previous film . If you have stuck with this review so far , you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take : either dismiss it in one unflattering sentence or spend an undeserving amount of time dissecting its flaws . I 'm sure I 've left out some of its ineptitudes but I wouldn 't forgive myself if I failed to mention the single greatest laugh-out loud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair ( yes , it even surpassed the afore-mentioned animated titanic duel for me ) , namely the d챕cor of the rebellious gods ' lair which is in the shape of a giant marble혚kettle ! ! At this stage , one might well wonder why I gave this film ( and its predecessor ) a rating instead of a ( not entirely unjustified ) BOMB ; in the past , I 've had various protracted online discussions on whether one 's star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality or its sheer entertainment value혚 but these are two instances where I deemed it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in settling on my final rating . I don 't know : maybe it 's because I 'm in a " " sword-and-sandal " " state-of-mind at the moment ( with some 10 more respectable examples scheduled for the coming days ! ) but , after all , uncharacteristically for me , I decided to add these two films to my DVD collection simply based on the fun I had with them in this recent revisit 혯 and that alone must count for something , no ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here . This is simply a " " run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc " " slasher , but without the passion that graced the original.There 's nothing new in the story , in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether . Here , the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and , naturally , kill most of the residents in grisly fashion . The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around . Although the actors weren 't exactly brilliant in Demons , in Demons 2 they 're actually a lot worse . You don 't care about these characters , AT ALL . The plot is nonexistent , the music poor ( apart from one Simon Boswell song ) , it 's not scary in the least ; it 's just not that good.Easily the worst film Dario Argento has been involved with and Lamberto Bava 's also ( Bava has a cameo in this film , not a very funny one ) .Maybe 3 is too high a rating , but at least I could watch it all and didn 't think of stopping midway . My advice ; Stick to the original . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Genghis Cohn is a ( very ) mildly entertaining British movie about a German police commissioner in the late 1950 's who is haunted by the ghost of a Jewish comedian that he killed 15 years earlier while serving under Hitler in the SS . The ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a Jew to atone for the murders he committed.Otto , the German policeman actually knows this ghost 's name because , the last thing he did before he died was said , in Yiddish , ' Kiss my ass ' . The policeman didn 't speak Yiddish , so he asked around until he found the meaning . The ' kiss my ass ' left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the comedian 's name , Genghis Cohn.There are a bunch of men who are murdered in the jurisdiction of the police commissioner , and there are no helpful clues . The men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher . The butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich , so the commissioner is a suspect . The first man is killed while making love to the butcher 's wife , so the butcher is a suspect . But the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife . All the men are killed immediately after the climax of lovemaking.I think I might be a bit angrier than the ghost of Genghis Cohn if I was killed like he was . He seems to be very good-natured about it , as if he was just in a mild car accident . I can only guess that it is because it is a British movie and they are known for being a very polite people . He uses some of his material from his stand-up routing , and I just didn 't find it very funny.I gave this movie a 4 because it was just kind of goofy . I thought it should have been a little more serious than it was . The movie turns out to be a murder mystery ( where did this come from ? ) , and it seemed that Genghis should have been more helpful than he was . The movie gave me a tiny look into Jewish culture , but was only skin-deep . Do all Jews love liver and onion sandwiches ? Do they all say ' shtoop ' and ' meshuganah ' in their daily vocabulary ? Isn 't there more important stuff that we should know about the culture ? I saw this movie at a Jewish community center in Berkeley , CA , and I was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white . ( I have no gray or white hair . ) There were 18 of us , and after the movie they stayed for about 20 minutes to discuss the movie . There were 2 main concerns expressed there : 1 . The movie was way too light-hearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and 2 . As the Holocaust survivors are dying off , future generations will not know what really happened .

" Here again is yet another Diane Lane movie where she cheats on her husband . Is this the only role she knows how to play ? This time it 's set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man . I am so not surprised because that is so very predictable . Then her husband gets mad and throws the milk . I wouldn 't be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well . I wouldn 't be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie . Then after some milk throwing , she says sorry and sees the blouse man again . Duh . Then while she is making it with him , her son gets stung by wasps . My mom always told me not to throw rocks at a wasps nest . This kids mom didn 't have time to tell him that , she was too busy with the blouse man . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Oh yes , I admit I have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash . I can 't say I was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head , tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on . No I did it with free will . I deliberately tortured myself . Let 's go through the fact here folks . - The acting is an insult to humanity . - The plot ( if it exists ) is ridiculous . - The character development is horrendous - The characters that appear in the movie are so clich챕d you would recognize them in your average comic book . - The editing is sloppy and unimaginative . - The camera-work is low key . - The dialogue is simply the worst in cinematic history . - The directing : well let 's say , I bet it wasn 't Hitchcock.Then to add to these facts , there was absolutely no talent involved wath so ever . The director must be smoking crack now to forgive himself for inflicting this poison to the world . Bottom line : Passport to Paris is one of the worst movies ever made .

" I had high expectations going into this film , but alas , I feel let down . I bought it for 5 bucks at a used VHS place , and the version I bought was the English dubbed version . The dubbing is awful , so beware . " " Lola " " just wasn 't as good in this film as in " " Run Lola Run " , " and the bad guy just kinda came out of nowhere . And " " Lola " " starts to catch on to what 's going on the second she gets to the university . Seems unrealistic to me .

Come on ! Who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly , no no , completely retarded ! Secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns.Thirdly whats with the Asian chick speaking perfect English ? If the setting is western , Asia isn 't where your going . Finally , the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning.Now don 't get me wrong I 'm not racist or white either so don 't get ticked after reading this but this movie , this movie is the worst presentation of black people I have ever seen ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great . Nothing is good Bloodline ... a lot of gore but without meaning and the majority of time without originality. the movie is about the past , the present ( 1996 ) and the future of the puzzle box . The creator of the box and his offspring fight against some demon but nothing link up seriously the 3 stories . Pinhead is in the movie ... but it isn 't Pinhead , he is just a boring bad guy who kidnap kids and kill bird , and the worse ... he talk too much . A thing that I really didn 't understand is why the dog from hell ? ? ? ? ? He can 't be a cenobites because he had nothing human . Why the dog can be killed by the pressure if the other creature from hell can receive bullets without problems ? ? ? ? ? Bloodline is incoherent with the movie series in many ways . For example Pinhead and Angelique are old friend in this movie but it 's impossible that Pinhead met Angelique because Pinhead is just a soldier from the First World War and Angelique is an old demon and she live in Paris since sometimes like 200 years . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Unfortunately I think this is one of those films that if you or I took it to the studio and said , ' can I make this great movie with my friends Mary , Mungo and Midge from school ? ' the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot . However , if a bunch of massive Hollywood names say , ' look , I fancy a jaunt to Italy with my mates , how about it ? ' the studio writes a cheque.We kick off with the casino boss from Ocean 's 11 tracking down the robbers who made off with his cash , and then Brad Pitt is shagging Catherine Zeta Jones , and then there 's some monkeying about in Amsterdam and Italy and such and such and then it all ends somehow.The film does , however , include the most shameful moment of both Julia Roberts ' and Bruce Willis ' careers , which is a cinematic gem . I nearly vomited in my lap and tore my eyes out when Julia Roberts , playing Tess in the movie , pretends to be ( you guessed it ) Julia Roberts ! Bruce Willis stands about clearly wondering when he can leave , and how much the cheque will be.Ah well , to be fair , I 'd have done it for the cash , so I suppose I can 't really criticize the poor loves , but I 'm a penniless slob not a Hollywood legend . I guess what really annoys me about this film is not that it is boring and pointless and has a terrible story , but that I think the actors probably all had good fun doing it ! I think the actor 's entire job is to project emotion outwards ... I feel like I paid to go to the party , but had to stand outside in the rain . Booo !

" I am a big-time horror / sci-fi fan regardless of budget , but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video , this has to be the worst of all movies . With bloody special effects ( what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again ) and people running around screaming from left , then to right , then back again . It should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes . Instead , it is dragged out very long . It is very , very x5 low budget . Many scenes were way , way too long . Narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking . This is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than Manos , Red Zone Cuba , Benji , and Godzilla vs. megalon despite their higher budgets . 10 snoozes , try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet , avoid it like you would an undead brain-eating mob .

" " " MirrorMask " " was a terribly disappointing film for me . I had expected much from a Jim Henson production and had found favourable reviews comparing it to " " The Labyrinth " " and " " Alice In Wonderland " . " Unfortunately , the film ended up in one of those " " style over substance " " pile of movies.Whereas most kids dream about running away from home to join a circus , Helena is a kid who has grown up in a circus ( child labour , anyone ? ) who wishes to run away to join Real Life . Helena wishes that her mother drop dead , which is a bad move for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a kid 's fantasy movie . Next thing you know , Helena 's mother flops over , and for some reason , she is suddenly transported to another world.Meanwhile , I felt as if I was transported to the Museum of Contemporary Art with a pair of foggy sepia-tinted glasses.The showcase of CGI-generated creatures and backdrop was interesting at first , and I liked the Orbiting Giants . It got a little too tiresome after a few minutes though , and I felt my mind wandering ... With no sense of narrative and MTV-style clips and soundtrack ( the sphinxes reminded me of Basement Jaxx 's " " Where 's Your Head At " " ) , I did not feel involved in the plight of the protagonist and also frustrated , as we waited for the film to lead us wherever it wanted , hopefully towards the " " Exit " " signs of the theatre ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Excerpt from TV GUIDE : This week on THE LOVE BOAT , Captain Stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected cargo ! Join the Captain , Isaac , Gopher and Julie in a fun-filled Halloween Special . Guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard suit as the Chupacabra.This is typical , lame Sci-Fi Channel cut-rate fare . The Captain of a cruise ship , played by the once respectable John Rhys-Davies , is in charge of a Carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico . His daughter is along for the ride , and she 's earning her keep by being the ship 's kickboxing instructor . Pay attention , everyone , that kickboxing will come in handy later ! It should be noted that the Captain 's daughter is pretty uncoordinated and painful to watch . It would have been good if she might have taken a couple of kickboxing classes before trying to play an instructor in a movie.Captain Stupid and his daughter join Mrs. Thurston Howell from Gilligan 's Island , a kooky cryptozoologist and a dark , mysterious stranger on this 90- minute ride into boredom.That 's right , I said cryptozoologist . He keeps mentioning that he brought some precious cargo on board that he needs to check out . Needless to say , the box contains a Chupacabra that somebody decides to let out . From this point on , a man in the rubber Chupacabra suit runs around the ship , killing people . Captain Stupid is powerless to stop it . He decides to call in the Marines but telling them that there are a bunch of terrorists on his ship.The Marines respond . They say all that Marine-speak stuff like " " Hooya " " and " " Get Some " . " But those silly Marines are no match for a Chupacabra . They don 't really tell anyone where they 're going either , so there 's no help in sight . I guess no one will really miss some lame battalion of lost Marines . But don 't forget ... Captain Stupid 's daughter is , thankfully , a Kickboxing instructor . Yay for Little Stupid ! She comes in right in the nick of time , she beats up the bloodthirsty Goat Sucker and saves the day . Chupacabra means Goat Sucker . Therefore , Chupacabras suck . But there 's no way that Chupacabras suck anywhere near as much as this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
alright this movie might have been good if there was a plot behind it. the title didn 't even fit the it after the first ten minutes. the wind didn 't have a whole lot to do with the rest of the movie. the acting was sub-par and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children 's book of scary stories. as far as horror movies go this shouldn 't even be classified as one. this was a disgrace to horror and thriller fans everywhere . I hate to be so harsh but I felt I want the time I spent watching this movie back. hopefully there will not be a follow up to this. this movie should be locked in a vault and never released to the public for viewing . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The plot in this movie is very thin , and there is not much acting . Val Kilmer--I don 't know why he agreed to do this movie--plays a minor role as a gang leader . In short , the movie is tedious to watch.One guy , who sort of resembles an archeology / religion professor , is exploring a subterranean area of Moscow , that has some history connected to railway construction and the Bolshevik revolution . A church tragedy in that history makes the exploration " " spiritual " " and spirits of a malevolent intent haunt the underground ruins . A friend of the professor decides to find his friend in the underground and hires a couple of Russian guides . The entire movie is based on this plot and contains much repeated footage of the underground , and some camera effects ; much like those seen in " " Day Watch " , " " " Night Watch " , " etc . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " People I Know " " is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about -- despite the game efforts of a talented cast.Pacino delivers his usual tour de force as Eli Wurman , a past-his-prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption . But unlike Michael Corleone , it 's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character , his dilemma , or his fate.The film traces Eli 's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause , while distracted by a client 's ( Ryan O 'Neal , good in an underwritten part ) latest " " dirty laundry " " -- in this case , a TV actress companion who 's gotten involved with the wrong people . Tea Leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role , although again , the script doesn 't give her much to work with . As Eli 's sister-in-law , Kim Basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics.This movie is strictly for those who like watching Pacino strut his stuff , and enjoy the other principals . Unfortunately , between the script and direction , " " People I Know " " is strictly amateurish . Hence its limited theatrical release , and speedy journey to DVD .

" What can you expect from a direct to DVD film ? You know what you are getting yourself into when you rent this . The quality of the cinematography reminds me of reality TV shows . Why are they shots always up so close to the actors ! ? And why are they always centered ? There isn 't anything to look at . ( And the actors are that great looking , so that blows . ) The writing and dialogue is just plain awful . That intro scene , with the British Guy is hilarious . Just try and listen this words , they hardly make any sense , just goes around in circles . The lines in the rest of the movie sounds like they were pull out of romance and sci-fi novels , as if the writers had no idea what they were doing .

" Am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on Showtime . The film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography , but the screenplay was stilted and wooden . The acting was fairly bad- thought the two female leads were serviceable . You never really believed anything the supporting actors said though . There were the stereotypes- bible-thumping Reverend without a hint of nuance , authoritative Captain , hot-headed soldier , etc . I am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies I clocked it straight away as Canadian without knowing it to be such-the Telefilm Canada end credits gave it away . I know I 'm a horrible person.Maybe I missed something in the beginning but the hostility towards the girls is never explained . Here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason . FOCUS people . There 's a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians-that 's just my inference for the hostility directed towards them . If they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them . The question of their " " immortal soul " " can be resolved later.Also , I guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy , these girls are supposed to be the protagonists ? One of them murdered the Indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives . I guess one is just a victim of her condition who can 't be necessarily blamed for her actions , but the other is just a murderer who doesn 't deserve her happy ending . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" You get a good portion of Steven Seagal environmental anxieties , and some breathless mountain views along with cow-boy scenes ( or alternatively use parts of any remains of the HORSE WHISPERER ) .

You add one teaspoon of martial arts , and a zip of explosions and gunfire for the taste . Add the classic red Indian herbs for the extra taste . Serve immediately.What is the name of the film you get ? : The Patriot . Perhaps the worst film of Steven Seagal .

" for the most part , On Demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies , and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen , and already have an opinion on . It was either this , or Invinicible ( I like Mark Wahlberg movies ) , which I haven 't seen , and I was actually in a movie watching mood , which doesn 't happen often anymore because I 've already watched all the movies i own a million times , and that 's a lot of movies , and I don 't have much interest in new movies , and boy , this movie made me regret it . I 'm not going to put in any spoilers , I 'm just going to tell you that only a FEW of the very FEW actors in this movie , are half way decent . I think the main girl , the dead one who kills everyone , is very annoying looking , but convincing ; I 'd take her for psycho bitch anyday , so she fits her roll well , though it is lame . The blood isn 't that great , only a few of the kills , or may I say " " woundings " " are alright , but you don 't see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing .

Most of the rest are pure caricatures with only Helen McCrory putting in real quality and providing something of the novel 's wit .

" I first heard of this movie at the " " Flashback Weekend " " in Chicago 2007 for the " " Nightmare on Elm Street " . " Robert Englund was really talking the movie up and he was great in his part of " " Hatchet " . " The same can be said for Tony Todd . Knowing this is a low budget first time director / writer it delivers every bit as much as the big budget and also cameo laden " " Holloween " " ( 2007 ) remake / re-imagining.Technically it falls short in a couple of places . The alligator attack seen was shoot too dark . When it happened the dark head of the alligator against the swamp clamping on to the black pants became almost invisible . The mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and canned , like a bad sitcom . And just like " " Holloween " " ( 2007 ) someone is smart enough to have a gun , but of course shooting the killer is only a pause button for the killer . The ending , well , as soon as I saw where it was going I knew what was going to happen , not very original.The highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions . Unlike " " Holloween " " ( 2007 ) we got to meet the people and care what happened to them . Ben ( Joel Moore , who is also the lead of " " Spiral " " ) the sulking lead and Marcus ( " " Not Another Teen Movie " " ) as the best friend and funny man to root for during the movie . Shapiro ( Joel Murry " " Dharma & Greg " " ) , Jenna ( Joleigh Fioreavanti ) and Misty ( Mercedes McNab of " " Buffy the Vampire Slayer : The Series " , " " " Angel : The Series " " and " " The Addams Family " " movies ) give a convoluted reason for topless women . Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo played by television regulars ( Richard Riehle " " Grounded for Life " , " Patrika Darbo " " Step by Step " " ) as the older couple that you know don 't stand a chance , even the tour guide Shawn ( Parry Shen ) is a fleshed out character .

" Because they all just watch there MST3K with their artificial friends who make ( mostly ) not that funny and obvious comments about movies . And that 's the only way these people watch them and then they comment and down-vote them on the IMDb based just on that , they don 't even try to watch the film on it 's own.I watched this film on it 's own , I didn 't read the reviews first , I didn 't have some people telling what to laugh at , I just got the DVD ( bought for the flip side Morons From Outer Space , an old fave ) and watched it.Of cause I knew kind of what I was in for when it 's a Golan Globus , Albert Pyun film , but usually they can be quite entertaining.The film is a non too stressing on the brain Alice down the Rabbit-hole story done so many times , and kind of similar in basic structure ( but completely different in content ) to Warlords of Atlantis , another entertaining B-Movie.The voice , was annoying , but then that 's the idea , which they even poke at with a few lines in the movie.The hero character had one of the worst over-the top voices / accents in English language film history , but you grow to accept it and enjoy it.It 's not a good film , but it 's not a really bad film , it 's just a bit of an average B-Movie DTV kind of film , nothing too new nothing too outstanding , and probably would be enjoyed more by a younger age bracket ( say 7-14 year olds ) than I. It 's a bit of light-hearted Fantasy.Will I see it again , probably not maybe about 10 years ago I would have.Don 't be so harsh on a movie because a couple of puppets told you too , this film isn 't taking itself seriously and it 's certainly no Troll 2 or Space Mutiny . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Florence Chadwick was actually the far more accomplished swimmer , of course . She swam the English Channel both directions . She swam from Catalina Island to the California coast . Marilyn Bell 's is a sweet story , but the usual glorification of us Canadians in the face of a superior world . Another sample of our inferiority complex . Our political system works pretty well and the health system allows people not to die in hospital lobbies . That 's pretty good . Better than Lebanon . What should we do about hockey though ... ? And curling . The notion of calling this a sport , of its inclusion in the Olympics ... ! ah , but we digress ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There are really two sections of this film . Firstly there 's the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the ' The Simpsons ' Troy McClure should be doing the narration.Then the rest of the film begins ( starting off with a title song which really doesn 't fit in with the rest of the film ) which , while technically OK , is killed by a vague , inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters , but characters that make no sense.This is especially so with Mickey Rooney 's Spiventa , who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the ' organisation ' the whole time yet what would have happened had Hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out ? In that case he would 've been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character , which in the end he still is.The overall problem of the film is that it 's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy . It 's as if the filmmakers didn 't have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions.Put simply , the film fails on all levels . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A friend warned me that this was the worst movie he had ever seen . I was curious , because it had developed a bit of a cult status . I like a lot of odd indie cult movies so I gave it a shot . I have to agree with my friend . It is a steaming pile of dung . I am sorry to the people who love this movie , but I can recommend much better stuff if you want to watch a twisted indie cult film .

" " " The Rainmaker " " released in 1956 - has some of the finest actors of its time . Katharine Hepburn , Lloyd Bridges , and Burt Lancaster being the principle players . Not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama . First of all , Hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress , not even she can pull this off . She is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton , and was just too old for the part . Lancaster over acts to the extreme , and Earl Holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like Jethro Clampett . Only Bridges and the ever reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much . It seems like the 1950 's was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress , and that is fine . She just made a bad choice here . Fortunately for her fans ( me being among them ) she didn 't make too many of them . Despite an A-list cast and good production values , it doesn 't work . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Was this movie stupid ? Yup . Did this movie depth ? Nope . Character development ? Nope . Plot twists ? Nope . This was simply a movie about a highly-fictionalized Springer show . It shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on TV . Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly 's mom . Jaime is .... well ... GORGEOUS ! This flick wasn 't so much made to be a " " breakthrough " " movie , rather , it was intended to life in a trailer park ( I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie ) where everyone sleeps with everyone else , all the girls get pregnant by different guys , and all the guys drive rusted-out ' 66 Ford pickups ( exaggeration , of course , but that 's the picture everyone sees when you mention " " trailer park " " ) . Some people over-analyze movies ( case-in-point : Star Trek freaks ) .

It doesn 't change the fact , that this is a very boring movie to watch . Earned itself a score of 1 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am a huge fan of Ted V Mikels and the original " " Corpse Grinders " " is the main reason why but this is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen . Even the brilliant casting of the legendary Liz Renay ( " " Desperate Living " " ) could not save this worthless piece of garbage . This film should serve as a lesson to all past , present and future film makers ... when you have a film as successful as the original " " Corpse Grinders " " was you should probably leave sleeping dogs lie and you should definitely not try to revitalize it over twenty years later ( unless you have the financial backing to pull of a superior sequel such as Herschel Gordon Lewis did with " " Blood Feast 2 : All U can Eat " " ) Even if you do decide to do this you should probably spend a little bit more money than you did on the original and for god 's sake ... NEVER film a movie onto video ... why do film makers even attempt to do this when everyone knows the quality is going to turn out hideous ... I personally have yet to see one film made in this fashion that 's even worth the powder to blow it to hell ... if you can 't afford to make a sequel that is better than your original film then sell the rights of the film to someone who can ... and what was Ted V Mikels thinking about ( or smoking ) when he wrote this god-awful script ? I mean come on , dog and cat " " aliens " " from another planet ? A cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of grinding up human bodies ... bones and clothes and all ? If any of these actors , aside from Liz Renay , were paid more than five dollars for their hideous performances than they are grossly overpaid !

" STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning Ray ( Ray Winstone ) has a criminal past , has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife Valerie ( Kathy Burke ) who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat . Meanwhile , her mother Janet ( Laila Morse ) is aware of Ray 's son , Billy ( Charlie Creed-Miles ) and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails . The film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives.It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable , and that would include watching films that entertain them this way . Films like Nil by Mouth highlight this . It 's a tale of a broken family , torn apart by crime , poverty , booze and drugs , the kind Jeremy Kyle would lap up like a three course meal . It is also essentially a tale of self destructive men , three generations apart and each copying the other , tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together , despite not being strong enough . If you pick up a little of what it 's about from the off-set , you can see it doesn 't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn 't disappoint in this.It 's true what everyone said about the performances , and the lead stars , Winstone and Burke , do deliver some great acting . We see Winstone lose it with his wife , beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia , breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid . Likewise , in a private moment , we see Burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase , the full impact of the night before kicking in.This is another of those films where there 's no ' plot ' to follow , as such , just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next . It 's been acclaimed by many ( including the Baftas ! ) but it really was just too grim and bleak for me . I have no right to criticize it for this , knowing what I knew about it from the off-set , but sadly this is how I found it . * * , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " Giant " " is one of the most boring , overly-long Hollywood contraptions ever . Many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy . Rock Hudson , Elizabeth Taylor , and James Dean are wasted in this big Hollywood production . A central notion to this movie , that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land , is absurd , and I know this because I 'm from Houston . A couple of scenes , especially Dean serving Taylor coffee , redeem this otherwise boring film . For a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how modernism changed the ranches in Texas , see " " Hud " " ( one of Paul Newman 's great performances ) or " " The Last Picture Show .

" Other than the great cinematography by the marvelous James Wong Howe in the battle scenes , this film is a true stinker.This is the second film that I 've seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda . The first was Charles Laughton 's " " Rembrandt . " " It was so lousy that I shut it off . This one I 'm afraid is not very much better.Flora Robson is as ugly as ever as Queen Elizabeth . Perhaps , her performance as the virgin Queen was good for 1937 standards but when you compare it to that of a Helen Mirren , it is absolutely no match . In robotic fashion , Robson states her lines . Her battle message to the English troops is so lackluster in spirit.Even a dashing Laurence Olivier can 't save this utter piece of boredom.Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn 't really convey anything here .

" I read about this film on-line and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received , and viewing the trailer , I decided to check it out for myself . What a disappointment ! It starts out well enough. the opening scene was actually pretty tense , but from there it 's all downhill . I can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie , but by doing so , they took all the enjoyment out of watching it . Those choices combined with the " " C.S.I " " editing , use of music and montage , lack of suspense , scares , or humor really drag this film down . There 's too much foreshadowing and to many " " subtle " " clues , so when the first twist arrives early on , you already know how the movie is going to end . I gave the movie three stars because I think the cast did a good job , other than that I can 't recommend this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Along with his turn in the super-sleazy ' classic ' THE TOOLBOX MURDERS ( 1978 ) , this is considered the ultimate bad Cameron Mitchell horror effort . It 's a little too slow-moving for my tastes , has zero likable characters in it and not much action until the very end , but Mitchell 's dedicated central psycho performance as vengeance-minded whack-job Vincent Rinard is fun . Not Anthony Perkins good , mind you , but definitely fun enough . As a spoof of the shallow conceit that is Hollywood , it 's only so-so ; as a horror movie it 's also only fair . And even as just a simple vintage exploitation picture , it 's just OK . I 'm a big fan of the unnecessary gratuitous dance sequence , so I was also thankful for the appearance of the Gazzarri Dancers , who just rule . Five of them do a crazy hair-thrashin ' , floor-slidin ' , hip-shaking ' go-go dance routine to " " Don 't Cry , Look For the Rainbow " " by the T-Bones . Watching these ladies bounce around with huge smiles on their faces in their fringe-covered bikini top and parachute pants ensemble is a defining reason why I give this a slightly higher rating that usual.Former movie make-up man Vincent Rinard ( " " The best since Lon Chaney ! " " ) goes after people at Paragon Studios . A flashback shows how Max Black ( Berry Kroeger ) , a jealous and drunk studio executive , flung wine in Vinnie 's face right when he was about to light a smoke . He 's engulfed in flames and dives into a pool , but not before scarring up one side of his face and losing an eyeball ( not to mention his sanity ) . Now employed by the " " world-famous " " Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park , California , Vincent uses a special serum ( described as a mixture of truth serum , nerve medicine and special " " vitamins and minerals " ... " Watch out Centrum ! ) to paralyze victims . They disappear and the dense detectives on the case ( headed by Scott Brady ) act baffled as new ' statues ' are put on display in the museum . Vince talks to himself ( " " I 'm a terribly nice man ! " " ) , chain-smokes , mumbles , hisses and describes how he gets " " excited " " by the sound of a woman 's scream.He also has to deal with a bunch of back-stabbing scumbags and self-absorbed witches , most of whom will deserve what 's coming to them . There is also Nick ( Hollis Morrison ) , a boozy , inept museum tour guide who sees a ' statue ' blink , but doesn 't go to the cops . Aside from Max ( a real Grade-A jerk ... who doesn 't even die ! ) and the stupid cops , the other two lead roles are women and both are pretty atrocious . Marie Morgan ( Anne Helm ) is not your typical innocent heroine ; this tramp has been engaged to no less that five different characters in this movie ( ! ) , including Vince , Max and two of the wax dummies / missing male stars ( I guess she never had time to make a go at the one missing girl ) . For some reason , she also begs and pleads in her irritating baby-voice for Vince to give her a ' replica ' of the head he 's designing of the newest missing actor ( and fianc챕 Number 5 ) Tony Deen ( Phillip Baird ) . She doesn 't know that Vince has already jabbed a syringe in the back of his neck , but I love it when Mitchell dryly agrees with her demands " " so you can completely retreat for reality . " " He also wants her to ' pose ' for him , which means she 's eventually held prisoner in a box . Unfortunately , the box has a hole where her head sticks through so we have to continue getting aurally assaulted by her high-pitched whines.The other " " woman " " is Theresa ( Victoria Carroll ) , one of the aforementioned go-go girls . She 's first seen proving she is thoroughly rhythm-deficient by jiggling on stage in a lime-green fringe bikini . Theresa is tolerable before she talks , but when you realize her grating presence combines the abrasiveness of Lorraine Bracco with the airhead mentality of the Landers sisters , you wish Vincent would inject her with the serum as soon as possible . Unfortunately , we 're first subjected to a scene of her making endless demands to the studio head honcho and running around in the museum trying to avoid Mitchell . She and the rest of the characters are completely unsympathetic , but function as a way to poke fun at the Hollywood system in general , I guess . And I 'm probably giving this movie more credit than it actually deserves . The pluses are few and far between , but include ( other than Mitchell and the dance routine ) , colorful , slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that Rinard will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell ... Married to Marie ! ... Yikes , now that is scary.Also in the cast are director John " " Bud " " Cardos ( also the production manager ) as a police sergeant , James Forrest as a film director , Virgil Frye as a statue , Rini Martin and Kent Osborne as a bartender . Many of the people who worked on this one ( including executive producer and script-writer Rex Carlton ) also worked on the Al Adamson movie BLOOD OF DRACULA 'S CASTLE and other atrocities.My Score : 4 out of 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it . The acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot . As a French " " Noir " " film , its language is certainly a lot earthier than its American counterparts , but to me this just added to the realism . Additionally , I liked how non-glamorous everyone was--particularly the husband and the lieutenant . About the only negative , and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10 , is because there was a glaring plot hole . Like another famous French film , Dr척le de Drame , the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning , but the characters made rather stupid decisions . For this , you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching--the payoff is well worth the wait.This is simply one of the finest French films I have seen . Period . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I will give it this : it tried . It did try to make it good and even got Luke Wilson involved . Luke Wilson is good , but he can only do so much . He can 't make up for the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdeveloped.The running " " gag " " with the bully was asinine . He was never funny and I got tired of the gag really fast . And the barefooted kid bit was kind of weak too . He hitchhiked to Florida ? Yeah OK.The movie felt like an average kiddie film at times with this underlining mantra : adults stupid , kids smart . And that bit gets tiresome.But the only moments that were funny was the police cart Wilson drove around when he lost his squad car . I loved that little cart , especially when Wilson turned on the sirens . But , other than that , nothing else was worth my time . " " D- " " , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of the commenter 's is wrong . This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he didn 't die two years after this was made . He shot a film called the " " Electric Chair " " in Pineville , NC . He shot this a few years after Doctor Gore . Patterson died in the late 70 's . I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there ! ! It sucked also . This was a big deal when the movie came out . No independent horror films were being made in NC . This movie didn 't help matters . Patterson used to do gore effects for H. G. Lewis . He was also good at magic . His gore scenes in Body shop were actually well done . The film was shot in a building that also housed a 7 / 11 . You can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes . The budget was less that $ 20,000 and the script looked like a child wrote it . Only Patterson could understand it .

" There are people out there who will greenlight anything ! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists . And that 's only scary part to the whole movie . It 's so bad you 'll go off movies forever . I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing . I don 't know why I do these bad things to myself.As if it matters , here 's the basic jist of the ' story ' . A group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest ( Canada actually , because it 's cheap ) for the ' Rave of the Century ' ( which consists of about 8 people and un-raving music ) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $ 1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry . That 's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough ! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead ( hang on-I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead ? ) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.First faults here . Why would a tiny little rave ( of the Century my foot ! ) be held on some remote island ? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it ? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others ? Once they arrive they discover that the rave ( which consists of about 2 tents , a small stage and a port-a-john ) has been smashed , there 's blood everywhere and no one is around . What would any rationally thinking person do ? Run for their lives of course . But no , these clueless , obviously blind people decide to go look for them . Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that 's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside . Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows , as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters , and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again . The characters , like the movie , go nowhere.Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue , heinous acting , mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name . Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I 'll never know . The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further , if that is at all possible.It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap , throwaway line at the end . It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory . Hell , even the Double Dragon movie seems multi-Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk . The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow . He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character . The rest of the cast suck I 'm afraid . The characters are idiots and deserve to die.Plus , if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity , I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV . It 's not frightening in the slightest . Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film . And where did all those bad guys come from anyway ? There were only a few people on the island to begin with . I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over . I kid you not , you 'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.Who 's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid ? None other than director Uwe Boll . His control over the movie is non-existent . You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren 't really taking it all seriously . The actors seem like they 're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card . It all feels very unnatural.Plus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series . I have indeed seen better TV productions . And don 't get me started on the editing . The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans . No real skill or talent was put into making this at all . It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero can 't even get anyone to take his calls . House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be ' post-modern ' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.For what it 's worth , the 1.85 : 1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used ADR even more . The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself . Isn 't this review warning enough ? Stay away ! You are all doomed I tell you ! Doomed ! Doomed ! ! ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was telling a friend of mine about the time my grandfather actually picked this horrible piece of crap for us to see one night at the theater . He never picked another one again !

She had never actually seen it , and she said that it put a quick halt to her father 's writing career . I told her not to waste her time . But , if she did actually break down and watch it , she would see within the fist minute why this ended her father 's days as a writer .

And the movie poster ? A ghost with his tongue hanging out ? What is that about ? Nothing about this makes any sense . Well , I told my friend that this crap not only ended her father 's writing career , it ended the careers of everybody involved .

" Cowardly and cynical , ' The Hospital ' represents the nadir of Paddy Chayefsky 's special brand of celebration of the status quo disguised as satire.Thanks to ham-handed director Arthur Hiller , this ludicrous script gets the visually ugly , poorly paced presentation it deserves.Only a great performance by George C. Scott , in the sort of mean-spirited role he was born to play , keeps ' The Hospital ' from being a complete disaster.Ironically , though , Scott 's performance does viewers a disservice . His magnetism keeps them watching when they might more profitably turn off the VCR and clean out the closets , stare at the clouds , or watch re-runs of ' Baywatch . ' Certainly , anyone who emotionally invests in the set-up _ modern medicine apparently gone amok _ will feel cheated by the dismal payoff , where Chayefsky reveals that The System Works Just Fine , So Quit Your Carping.While the first half of this film provides some entertaining black comedy , it all turns out to be a red herring . Before that becomes clear , though , Chayefsky gives some good lines to Scott as his middle-aged , middle-class , white male stand-in.Bitter , alcoholic , impotent , Scott 's Dr. Herbert Bock has alienated those who know him best , and he has the bile to keep alienating them . In Chayefsky 's worldview , all that of course makes Bock a magnet for a hippie chick half his age.Playing a collection of adjectives , the long-haired , long-legged , braless and almost bust-less Diana Rigg struggles in the part of ' the girl . ' The British Rigg is miscast as a southwestern free spirit , but any other actress would struggle as well . Like the rest of a good cast gone to waste , Rigg can 't overcome a script that isn 't interested in any character except Bock , or any philosophy beyond banality.For fans of George C. Scott , this is another star turn and worth watching . For fans of black comedy , turn it off after the first 45 minutes . For anyone else , don 't bother . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is basically just a dumb chase story , nearly identical to zillions of other chase stories in terms of acting , suspense , plot , dialogue , characterization ( or lack thereof ) , and pacing.The one area in which ' The Net ' diverges from traditional chase movies is in its subject material : Computers . Unfortunately , the scriptwriters clearly didn 't understand the differences between a pocket calculator and a Cray ! Computer-newbies shouldn 't watch this movie , because it will make them paranoid about computers . No matter what Hollywood tries to tell us , it 's just not that easy to erase someone 's identity by hacking . There 's still too much paper documentation in the world , and there was even more of it in 1995.Computer-pros shouldn 't watch this movie , either . I mean , a magical virus that can melt your entire PC when you press " " Escape " " ? Please .

" This extremely bargain-basement Blaxploitation / Kung-Fu hybrid was in my country released by a questionable DVD label that usually speaking just occupies with the transfer of pure crap onto disc , so that wasn 't exactly a favorable herald . Several other titles were released in the same series , like " " The Black Six " , " " " The Black Gestapo " " and " " The Black Godfather " " and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews none of these belong to the elite of the 70 's Blaxploitation hype , neither . " " TNT Jackson " " is a pretty lousy film , completely lacking a significant plot but featuring far too many laughable fighting scenes and horrible acting to compensate . Apparently Roger Corman 혯 never too embarrassed to make some easy money 혯 assigned two of his most loyal acolytes to rapidly invent a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of both oriental Kung-Fu movies and contemporary trendy Blaxploitation flicks . The result Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller came up with was " " TNT Jackson " " ; the tale of an arse-whooping black babe traveling to Hong Kong in search of her missing brother . She quickly discovers he was killed by a criminal network of drug-smugglers and swears to avenge him . Mrs. Jackson smoothly infiltrates into the underground and encounters macho pimps , helpful undercover agents , loads of vicious Kung-Fu fighters . Only one thing 's for sure ; they all want a piece of TNT 's ravishing body in one way or another . I sincerely doubt movie concepts get any more elementary than this , but 혯 unfortunately - all the other aspects suck too . The battle scenes are overlong and moreover pathetically staged . Jeannie Bell and the other poor suckers try really hard to stare menacingly and assume a tough position , but eventually all they ever do is kick in the air and stupidly leap across rooms . The cinematography is horrid , the soundtrack is vastly disappointing ( whatever happened to soul music ? ) , the few dialogs are poorly written and the acting performances are inferior . Speaking of which , Jeannie Bell is undeniably a beautiful woman , but still she can 't hold a candle to Tamara Dobson or Pam Grier . There 's only one really good and memorable scene in " " TNT Jackson " , " namely the famous hotel room battle where Bell , entirely naked except for panties , repeatedly switches the light on and off whilst kicking the hell out of some goons . Amusing scene ... I just haven 't figured out yet whether it 's thanks to the light switch ingenuity or Bell 's perfectly shaped breasts . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay I 've ever seen . Aside from the acting , which is wooden , no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows , up the middle of roads , and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready . The constant suicidal behavior set off my " " tilt switch " " so often I found it impossible to enjoy the movie . Apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had . This movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in Saving Private Ryan . Unless you are under 7 years old , I recommend watching something else.GB , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Donald Sutherland , an American paleontologist visiting England , picks up a hitch hiker one evening . Two years later , having discovered the man 's address book in his car , he returns the book to the man 's opulent home , only to find that the man 's been hanged for murder . Nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder ( of his own stepmother ) because he was in Sutherland 's car at the time of the crime.Sutherland is the man 's alibi but he 's turned up too late . Out of a sense of guilt , he tracks down the real murderer.Agatha Christie 's mysteries usually involve a number of diverse people , all of them with one or another motive for the crime , all of them suspect , and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict time line . There is often , not always , a sidekick with whom the investigator can talk things over.Because of the anfractuosity of the situation , due care must be taken to explain each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer . Redundancy is perfectly okay . We have to keep the characters and the time lines straight . Christie 's movies are of the rare kind in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is actually useful . ( Jacqueline de Bellefort ? Oh , yes , that 's Mia Farrow . ) But this version of " " Ordeal by Innocence " " is a Golan-Globus production , with all that implies in the way of production values , a thoughtfully prepared script , and skill behind the camera.The first few minutes , in which Sutherland discovers that an innocent man has been hanged , are fine . After that , everything is flung at the viewer in disjointed scraps , often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing voiceovers that tell us nothing . The script has a slapdash quality , as if thrown together by two hacks overnight . Few of the faces are familiar and that doesn 't help at all . Everyone drops remarks about everyone else and the names become a hopeless jumble . The musical score consists of four instruments doing irritating atonal jazz riffs . Some nudity is thrown in to wake up the dozers in the audience . If Dame Agatha were alive , she 'd be among the viewers who needed to be shaken awake.Dullsville. , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film is sometimes called ' The Story of O-Pt.2 ' , which tries to pass itself off as a sequel ( of sorts ) to the French erotic S & M thriller ' The Story Of O ' . Although I 've never seen the original version , I did , however get to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual & social politics . I guess the ' O ' angle comes from the occasional S & M overtones ( which were never as explicit ( and unpleasant to watch ) as the ones in ' Mistress ' . Klaus Kinski is the only recognizable face in this French / Japanese production ( but speaks his lines in English--at least in the version I saw ) . The unnecessary use of surrealism only manages to make this some what boring example in pseudo porn even more pretentious ( what are they trying to prove with depicting a piano floating in water ? ) . It 's obvious that after the whole " " porno chic " " trend in cinema petered out ( ouch-sorry , bad pun ! ) about 1975 , producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the mavens of adult cinema , not to mention Foreign / Art Cinema , so film goers had to contend with dreck like ' The Last Woman ' , and others like it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This Drummond entry is lacking in continuity . Most of them have their elements of silliness , the postponed wedding , and so on . However , this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another . The house seems more like a city . There 's also Leo G. Carrol who is such an obvious suspect who no-one seems to even look at . He is a stranger and acts rather suspicious , but Drummond and the folks don 't seem to pick up on anything . Still , it as reasonably good action and a pretty good ending.I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic figure , but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes flicks , he is so buffoonish that it 's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him .

" This is another film I missed out on Italian TV as a kid : notable for its quintet of ageing stars , most of whom had never made a horror film in their life ( Fred Astaire , Melvyn Douglas , Douglas Fairbanks Jr . , John Houseman and Patricia Neal ) , it deals with the men ? 셲 long-concealed past crime coming back to haunt them . It takes the form of a ghostly dead-ringer for the girl they all loved ( Alice Krige ) but whom they were forced to dispose of after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated their egos ! Fairbanks , who was the one responsible for the deed , has twin sons ( Craig Wasson ) and so Krige directs her revenge upon them as well . Soon one of the latter , Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman all wind up dead . Therefore , the remaining Wasson and Astaire decide to confront the ghost at the scene of the crime where they also have to contend with a couple of sinister tramps who somehow do Krige ? 셲 bidding ! I was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs ( Douglas died before the film had even premiered though , by that time , he had already completed another role , while it proved Astaire ? 셲 own inauspicious swan-song ) but GHOST STORY went through too many changes of mood ? ? while maintaining a sluggish pace throughout and emerging overlong into the bargain ? ? to be anything but a failed curio . Having dollops of sex ( including full-frontal nudity from Wasson ! ) and gruesome make-up effects muddled the waters all the more and marred the old-fashioned elegance inherent in Jack Cardiff ? 셲 ( another notable of long-standing ) cinematography . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There are some nice shots in this film , it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light , in fact the cinematography is probably it 's best asset.But it 's basically more of a made for TV movie , and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot , which keeps it quite interesting viewing , there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish , so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost.I had it as a Xmas gift , as it 's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented , and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in " " A Time to kill " " , and the " " The Newton Boys " " so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work.However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy , he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film , he is basically an extra and he doesn 't exactly light up the screen while he is on , so die hard fans , really not worth it from that point of view.The films star though , Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye , and his character is just so nice and kind and caring , a true saint of a guy , he 'd be well written into a ROM com.So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I 've seen , I 'd recommend , " " A Time to kill " " , " " The Newton Boys " " " " Frailty " , " " " How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days " , " " " Edtv " " and " " Amistad " " and avoid too " " Larger Than Life " " and " " Angels in the Outfield " " unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent , but are quite amusing films for children , again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.As for Scorpion Springit 's not a bad film but it also isn 't screen stealing either . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was dreadful . Biblically very inaccurate . Moses was 80 years old when he led the people out of Egypt , the movie has him about forty . Moses was about forty when he fled Egypt , was gone for forty years , and was with them wandering for forty years . Moses was 120 years old when he died , and was denied the privilege of crossing over to the promised land . I realize movies use a lot of " " poetic license " " as the biblical account isn 't that long , but , if making a biblical movie they still need to reflect the facts known , and keep the general flavor of the main biblical character , this movie fails in this aspect , and in many others.Even though the 1956 version has its problems as well , theatrically it was much better . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Blame Guy Ritchie . The late 90s success of Ritchie 's clich챕-ridden Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels triggered a series of pitiful gangster movies from which the genre never really recovered . Sadly Rise of The Footsoldier - the true story of Essex hardnut Carlton Leach - isn 't likely to reverse that trend . Despite a decent lead performance from Hartnett , the film falls victim to all-too familiar East End stereotypes . They 're either busy blowing someone 's brains out or shagging a scantily-clad blonde.From fearsome football hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld during the nineties , Footsoldier charts Leach 's rise through the ranks of thuggery . Leaving the terraces for nightclubs , Leach becomes a bouncer where he 's given carte blanche to kick the crap out of anyone . Here he gets in with notorious gangland leaders Pat Tate ( Fairbrass ) and Tony Tucker ( Stone ) , and begins to realise gang-warfare ain 't what it 's cracked up to be.There is fun to be had deconstructing writer-director Julian Gilbey 's laughable join-the-dots yob patois , as every sentence seems to start with an , ' I 'm gonna fackin '혚 ' or ' You fackin '혚 ' or , on occasion , ' So then I only went an ' fackin '혚 ' , typically concluded with a mandatory ' caaaant ! ' The direction , too , smacks of sadism , especially the obvious glee Gilbey gets from filming violent scenes in close-up and , in the case of the bloody shotgun-to-the-face denouement , in triplicate.Director Gilbey 's use of the classic rise-and-fall gangster narrative isn 't what will condemn Footsoldier to big screen obscurity . Nor is it the fact that half way through , the film annoyingly sidelines Leach in favour of the events culminating in the infamous shooting of Tate and Tucker . It 's Gilbey 's sickening appetite for scatter-shot violence that ruins the film ; whether it 's a brick in the face or axe in the head during a vicious attack on a train , it 's all unnecessarily prolonged . Footsoldier doesn 't so much pack a punch as leave you feeling violated and more importantly , robs you of two hours of your life you won 't get back ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hey , remember when Hal Hartley was brilliant ? What a time that was . I 'd say the Book of Life was when things really started going downhill , but I will say that at least he went uphill from this one . A movie that looks like it was filmed on someone 's cell phone wouldn 't have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog , but alas , those are missing , along with Hartley 's spare , quirky dialog . In their place is tedious exposition on themes of Christian end of times and a trite story of a modern Jesus in a quandary , packaged in a trying-to-be-hip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a Hal Hartley movie . While it picks up a little in its second half , it 's never enjoyable , or especially sensible . What the hell happened to you , Hartley ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Jennifer decides to sell it as she 's in dire need of the money much to Granny 's chagrin . She also begins to have troublesome recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven . There was really no one to relate to in this film . Jennifer seemed cold , distant , unsentimental , and narcissistic , whereas the grandmother seemed spiteful , sad , and also narcissistic .

" Mario Racocevic from Europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film.Yet again another difficult film to purchase in the UK.I had to go through " " Midnight Video " " who have a Swedish branch.I went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only SKR30 a title.This film goes under many " " a.k.a 's " " depending on when and where it is marketed.I had previously purchased " " The Bloodsucker leads the Dance " " ( which you will find if you search on Imdb under " " people " " and input " " Krista Nell " " ) .The actor who plays the Count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from Italian into English by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voice.I smiled when I heard this same voice dubbing on the English soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the copse in the subject film.My choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious Krista Nell.There are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmail / extortion , sleazy affairs with girlfriends ' mothers , a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit , a gangrape by a " " client 's " " motorcycle friends , sleazy photography , cross dressing by transvestites etc. which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word - SLEAZE , ( but artistic sleaze ) .The aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other Imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their " " wheres and whyfores " . " Personally I thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters.Also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long , having made their point , so that the film appeared to drag in places ; e.g. the scene of the dancing transvestite.Krista Nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and I was left wanting more from her , the director and the screenplay.I love the political incorrectness shown in older films ( this is 30 years from its making ) e.g. smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office ! I would suggest 4 / 10 as a more realistic rating and I have awarded it as such . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" While I can 't deny that his movies are often entertaining , I have always personally felt that Martin Scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities . His use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream " " Look at me , aren 't I an imaginative director ? " . " His best film that I have seen is the one with the least added flourishes , the superlative " " Raging Bull " . " For this remake it appears it was business as usual , though . The dull film stock to convey a 1950 's setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself . The melodramatic close-ups combined with the sub-par imitation of the classic " " Psycho " " score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror . The score for " " Psycho " " was brilliantly unnerving , this ' homage ' just sounds shrill and annoying . Even the cast , who can be decent at times , deliver histrionic performances that just scream ' caricature ' ; the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by Lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family.The worst acting offender here is surprisingly De Niro . Sure , he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away . Now I 'm no expert on American accents , me originally coming from near Manchester in England an ' all , but surely he could 've come up with a more convincing Southern drawl than that ? Being the gifted physical actor he is , he almost overcomes this fatal flaw , but not quite . It was disconcerting for me , as a De Niro fan , to be wishing he was off screen , rather than rapt at his performance . ( POSSIBLE SPOILERS . ) The over-the-top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale . When will Scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment ? I also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the ' killer-not-dead-yet ' cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ.All in all , a thoroughly ridiculous ' thriller ' . Scorsese and De Niro have done MUCH better work together . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Favela Rising is a documentary about the slums of Rio , the favelas , specifically the most violent one , Vig찼rio Geral . According to this film , a lot more kids have died violently in Rio 's favelas over the last decade or so than in Israel / Palestine during the same period -- a fact astonishing if true , which shows how under-recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world . This is an important topic , especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to marshal the neediest and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program . This is a compelling documentary , if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personality-based version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examined.Drug lords rule in the favelas and gun-toting teenage boys are the main drug dealers , like in parts of Colombia . Fernando Meirelles ' movie City of God / Cidade de Deus has been accused of celebrating violence ( Cidade de Deus is another of Rio 's many favelas ) . But the early section of Favela Rising shows that in fact favela boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are . It 's cool to carry a gun there , cool to work as a drug trafficker : it 's fifty times more profitable than the earnings available by other means.Mochary first discovered the AfroReggae movement and its leaders Anderson S찼 and Jos챕 Junior while visiting Rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor Zimbalist to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to fund it . S찼 's eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator , but like the favelas themselves the film teems with other people . No doubt about the fact that S찼 is a remarkable leader , organizer , and artist.Vig찼rio Geral is compared to Bosnia : shooting there was very dangerous . Anderson S찼 's friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting enabled the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while ( mostly : there were close calls ) avoiding any serious confrontations with drug lords or drug-dealing cops . They also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home . That resulted in 10 % of the footage , including rare shots of violent incidents including police beatings . It 's hard for an outsider to keep track of police massacres in Rio . There was one in the early 1990 's that looms over the story and inspired S찼 , who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement . The cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody doesn 't like that the ill trained police paramilitaries come in ( often wearing black ski masks ) and shoot up a neighborhood , killing a lot of innocents.This is pretty much the picture we get in Meirelles ' City of God , except that this time S찼 , Junior , and the other guys come in , starting in Vig찼rio Geral but spreading out eventually to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth -- girls as well as boys . Their AfroReggae ( Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR ) program , formed in 1993 , is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the Rio ghettos . It leads them to leave behind smoking , alcohol , and drugs ( that 's the rule ) to explode into rap , song , percussion , and gymnastics in expressive , galvanic performances . Eventually the best of the performers led by S찼 wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers , and their Banda AfroReggae has an international recording contract.Other centers and groups have been created by or through the GCAR over the years in Vig찼rio Geral and other favelas to seek the betterment of youth by providing training and staging performances of music , capoeira , theater , hiphop and dance at GCAR centers.The performance arts aren 't everything , just the focal point . GCAR is also a movement for broader social change Gathering public awareness through such performances , the centers also provide training in information ( newspaper , radio , Internet , e-mail links ) , hygiene and sex education , to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor , black and white , and to offer workshops in audio-visual work , including production of documentaries . The program is currently active in four other favelas.There are many scenes of favela street and home life in Favela Rising and they look very much like the images in City of God with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very , very much more positive . Not that it isn 't an uphill battle . And the corruption of the police , the inequities of the social system , and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not directly addressed by any of this . But there 's a scene where S찼 talks to some young kids in another favela , cynical boys not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and determined to work in the drug trade as S찼 himself did as a boy . S찼 doesn 't seem to be convincing any of them despite pointing out that traffickers don 't make it to the age of fifty . But we learn that the most negative boy in this group , Richard Morales , joined the movement five months later . There 's also the account of a freak accident that disabled S찼 , but with a positive outcome.It would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story were edited down a little , but this is vibrant , inspiring material and represents committed , risk-taking documentary film-making and it 's nice that Favela Rising has been included in seven film festivals and won a number of awards , including Best New Documentary Filmmaker at the Tribeca Film Festival . It 's currently being shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts ( ICA ) in London . However , a wide art house audience in the US seems somewhat unlikely.Included in the SFIFF 2006 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Soon Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of obnoxiously hammy college kids headed by the grating Richard Wiley who ran over Hagen with his RV on a camping trip gone awry . Soon the cyborg will be blasting away with her arm laser burning one innocent alcoholic Doctor ( Robert Quarry of Count Yorga-Vampire fame ) proving that no one will stand in it 's way of retrieving the hide of the convict , whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body . Law finds an ally in Leo Gordon , an old Vietnam war vet with way too weapons stashed in his cabin.Perhaps intentionally made awful , this features what fans of " " rancid cinema " " yearn for .. dreadful special effects , acting , and premise . At least , the film has PJ Soles for some eye candy .. even in ' 89 , she was quite smokin ' . That laser gun sure is funny .. it can incinerate some houses yet when the Cyborg shoots at Law it barely leaves a mark on the location fired . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Movies about U.F.O. ' s are always a nice way to kill some time , so on a rainy Sunday evening I picked up this flick , expecting what can be expected from a direct-to-DVD U.F.O. mystery.Boy , was I wrong ! At about halfway in the movie it becomes very apparent that the U.F.O. theme is just a deceptive way of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this Christian propaganda . And this is not just a Christan movie from an average Christian . No , this is Christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind . The scary kind.In the end of this movie , the non-believing lead is tricked by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the Rapture has started ( which is believed by Christians to be the happening in the end of time where true believers are going to heaven and non-believers are left behind ) .When the joke is explained , it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer , ' just in case we Christians are right ' . Now that 's a lamest excuse ever to become a Christian if you ask me ! This movie still tries to convert non-believers using scare tactics . " " Believe in God or you will go to Hell ! " " is the message here . Simple , but quite offensive , really . Especially because this movie is being sold as something completely different.Now let 's assume you 're a Christian fundamentalist yourself and you 're not likely to be offended by the themes in this movie , is this a good movie ? I 'm afraid it isn 't . No actually I 'm lying : I 'm GLAD it isn 't ! The acting is horrible , the pacing is horrible , the plot is horrible , especially the ending is laughably bad . As soon as the movie starts , you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected , and you will be right.In the first half hour , it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable U.F.O. mystery , but then suddenly they bring in this Count Dracula look-alike that starts babbling about the devil . At first you just think this dude is just a crazy maniac , but as it turns out , he actually represents the real views of the makers of this movie . As soon as you start realizing this , you know how this is going to end up . But actually it ends up worse.Avoid. , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well its ten year 's on since this film was released and the sands of time have not improved it one bit , again like the other comments made the Aussie film makers should have a little more drama rather than middle class aussies riding around beautiful places on there bikes with not much in the was of dialog. middle class is not funny nor is rich. there is also a mish mash of cast. why is a young woman going to marry a man old enough to be her father , it escapes me .

" It is a movie which sheds the light on the begging of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of Palestine but it does not show the real feelings of the people back then and how they were tricked into believing that they could return to their home soon , it does not mention the massacres committed by the Jews like Der Yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any Palestinian freedom fighter it lacks the credibility about the real Palestinian struggle and about anything Palestinian , however it has something about the suffering of Palestinian citizens ending up as refugees in the nearby Arab countries , the movie focuses on the story of the man in coma he is now in the present time and through his story we see the film .

" Plankton , or Creatures from the Abyss as I 'm positive it 's more commonly known as & filmed under as the title Creatures from the Abyss appears over a moving image & in the same font type as the rest of the credits , starts with five 20 something kids , Mike ( Clay Rogers ) his girlfriend Margaret ( Sharon Twomey ) , sisters Julie ( Ann Wolf ) & Dorothy ( Loren DePalm ) & an annoying idiot named Bobby ( Michael Bon ) whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat & head out to sea , don 't ask why as I don 't know . Oh & the complete idiot Bobby left the petrol behind & never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any petrol for the motor & to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm & discover a dead body floating in the water . Shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht & potential safety , in a flash everyone boards the yacht & begin to explore . First of all they find a scientific lab with various fish specimens & computer equipment , then down below they find fully furnished & luxurious cabins . They find a chemist ( Deran Sarafian ) who appears mad & can 't talk . They eat fish from the fridge which makes Dorothy puke up green vomit , beetles & slugs . They learn that these fish are living fossil 's 1000 's of years old & have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea & that they fly , mutate , bite & are generally unpleasant to be around . I really can 't be bothered to go on with this plot outline so I won 't , here 's what I think ... This Italian production was produced & directed by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri ( I 'd hide under a different name if I made a film this bad too ) & I think Plankton is quite simply one of the worst films ever , there are so many things wrong with this film it 's difficult to know where to start . First the script by Richard Baumann is total crap , it makes no sense whatsoever & is so slow & dull it was torture for me to sit through . Why would five people just simply set sail for the middle of the ocean on a rubber dinghy barely big enough to fit them all in ? What were they planning on doing exactly ? Why do we often get point-of-view shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character , & how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in ? People 's actions & reactions to things are all wrong , they constantly split up , they make bizarre decisions that simply don 't make any sense in the situation they find themselves in & some of the dialogue is as awful as anything I 've heard . I could go on all day about all the plot holes & ridiculous goings on but I 'll run out of space if I do . The fish creatures themselves look awful , a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets & some really bad stop motion animation at the end , the scenes where they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad super imposition . I have heard a lot of comments saying that Plankton is gory , don 't make me laugh ! Forget it there is virtually no blood or gore in Plankton whatsoever , there are a couple of slimy scenes when Bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with Julie but it 's pretty brief & he doesn 't kill her , he just sort of drips slime on her , grows a couple of tentacles & a fish head comes out of his mouth . Later on Julie 's vagina starts to drip some dark slime but that 's it , we never get to actually see what happens to her or what the slime is . Dorothy has a fish creature come out of her back , off screen , & control her but again we never get to see what happens to her while Margaret commits suicide , a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead . Easily the grossest scene is when Dorothy pukes up that green stuff with what looks like beetles & slugs in it . That 's it , only one person actually dies on screen & for the most part Plankton is quite tame & as exciting as watching paint dry & I nearly fell asleep it 's so boring . I can 't see how anybody can like this total crap , I just can 't . The acting is awful , the dubbing is awful , the characters are awful & I hated all of them . Tecnically Plankton is predictably crap as well , with an estimated budget of only $ 250,000 all I can say is where did the money go ? The sets are monotonous & dull with one lab & a few cabins , the special effect 's are bottom of the barrel stuff including the most fake looking exploding boat ever , the cinematography is bland , the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension & as a whole Plankton , like it 's name sake , is as low in the food chain as it could possibly be . I hate Plankton , it 's awful in every single aspect of it 's overlong 86 minute duration . Do yourself a favour & avoid this one at all costs unless your either a masochist or insomniac . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I gave this movie a four-star rating for a few reasons . First , I felt that this movie was definitely preaching and I hate that . Still , it 's my own fault for watching a Christian movie in the first place.My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting . The back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle , someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like . Something I am very interested in , indeed . This movie almost hit the target . It was more like on the edge of the target , more on the tree than the target itself ... The basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments . However , because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms , the men of the couples are now able to feel , smell , hear , and see the demons of the spiritual world . In that order . Apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm.This movie is very clich챕d . They took the title seriously as the men , while chained to the beds , demand their women look behind them because there is something there.Although a good effort for what it was , I think the special effects could have been done so much better . The demon scratching at the woman was , in a word , hilarious . The wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died . We were all hoping she 'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair , though.The message is one that I don 't care to comment on , other than I think the Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it.And so I give it four stars because it is not the movie 's fault I am not a Christian and don 't like this type of message , and I got a kick out of making comments throughout . My friend and I watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of MST3K . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Redundant , everlasting shots , useless shots , useless scenes are what you will find in this film . In other words , it seemed technically poor to me . The musical bits are amateurishly directed ( no synchronization in the would-be dancing , badly post-synchronized , bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time , etc ) . The film is long and boring . Eventually , it makes few point and even less sense . There are some good ideas though . Some of the comic elements are actually efficient , especially the opening scene . However , the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end . The trailer I saw was very dynamic , that is not true for the film . That is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " The Apartment Complex " " is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story which tells a young psych student ( Lowe ) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery ... um , if you can call it that .

" Basically , a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity . The premise is interesting , the acting is good , and the music , although sometimes abrupt and without direction , is pretty cool.The problem is the plot . The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show ( she has a minor role ) and then walks back in to give her something , but sees her with another man . The rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode , his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego ( Denis Leary , a former patient of his ) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to " " do something about it . " " I won 't tell you the ending , but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper . The motivations of the characters are missing : Why is she cheating on him ? He 's a dentist , decent looking , good father . The film doesn 't say . Who 's she doing it with ? Don 't expect any answers on that either . Why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this ? Who knows . What purpose does all the kids vomiting serve ? Where is this film going ? Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis ( and Denis Leary as comic relief ) are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which doesn 't know if it wants to be American Beauty or a family film .

" I didn 't really know what to expect from " " Future-Kill " , " but I certainly hoped it would be a little better than what I got . I knew the rating was bad and the reviews were unfavorable , but the Subversive DVD-cover illustration looks beyond cool and I can 't resist that . For a very long ( too long , in fact ) time , this film raised the impression of being an unofficial sequel to Porky 's with lame , vulgar and offensive fraternity pranks . Five mega-dorks , one of them resembling an exact young clone of Jim Carrey , desperately want to become members of a frat house but their ultimate initiation might just be a tad bit far-fetched and dangerous . They are dropped in the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces , simultaneously with the outbreak of a violent gang war . It doesn 't take too long before they are confronted with Splatter , a seemingly half-man and half-machine warrior , who leads a gang of which I never really figured out who or what they were . Were they a government experiment ? Cyborgs ? Terminator imitations from a distant future ? Does anyone care ? " " Future-Kill " " is a bizarre amateur flick with a scenario that leaps from one subject onto the other without any form of logical connection or narrative . The plot borrows vital elements from great cinematic cult classics like " " The Warriors " , " " " Escape from New York " " and " " The Terminator " , " but the end result is one gigantic Sci-Fi monstrosity . The costumes and special effects are quite pitiable and there 's a truckload of cheap and gratuitous nudity . The acting is terrible , but I 'm willing to blame the retarded dialogs instead of the cast members . One to avoid at all costs , in spite of really cool DVD-cover art .

" This was quite possibly the worst film I 've ever seen . The plot didn 't make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful . I 'm a big fan of Amber Benson , I think she 's usually a wonderful actress , I can 't imagine why she decided to do this film . Her character , Piper , is drunk for almost the whole film , with the exception of the opening scene . On the plus side , there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad , I actually laughed out loud . But despite that , I would not recommend this film to anyone .

" I saw this movie during a Tolkien-themed Interim class during my sophomore year of college . I was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy- everyone else was laughing , but they weren 't within constant eyesight.Let 's get it out of the way : the Peter Jackson ' Lord of the Rings ' films do owe something to the Bakshi film . In Jackson 's version of The Fellowship of the Ring , for instance , the scene in which the Black Riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in Bakshi 's film , shot by shot . You could call this plagiarism or homage , depending on your agenda . I 'm sure the similarities don 't stop there . I 'm not going to do any research to find out what they are , because that would imply I have some mote of respect for this film . I 'm sure others have outlined the similarities- look around.This movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor , and many , many people died in the accident . I 've decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological fashion- If I 've left out anything else that offended me it 's because I 'm completely overwhelmed , confronted with a wealth of failure ( and , at high points , mediocrity ) . * Due to heavy use of rotoscoping , Gandalf is no longer a gentle , wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom ( whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film ) . * Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as ' Aruman ' during the film , without explanation . He wears purple and red for some mysterious reason . * Sam is flat out hideous . The portrayal of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying . Yes , hobbits are small like children , but they are NOT children . * Merry and Pippin are never introduced--they simply appear during a scene change with a one-sentence explanation . The film is filled with sloppy editing like this . * Frodo , Sam , Pippin and Merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road . One of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back--which was not visible before--and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into " " la-la-la " " s . AWFUL . * Aragorn , apparently , is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic ( no pants ) , complete with huge , square pilgrim belt buckle . He is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie--oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass . * The Black Riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil . They limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace . This is disturbing to be sure , but not frightening . * The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen ( in which they stare at Frodo , who is on the other side on horseback ) goes on forever , during which time the Riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and ... do nothing else . The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo 's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound . It turns out to be more plodding than anything else . * Gimli the Dwarf is just as tall as Legolas the Elf . He 's a DWARF . There is simply no excuse for that . He also looks like a bastardized David the Gnome . It 's a crude but accurate description . * Boromir appears to have pilfered Elmer Fudd 's golden Viking armor from that Bugs Bunny opera episode . He looks ridiculous . * Despite the similarity to Tolkien 's illustration , the Balrog is howl inducing and the least-threatening villain in the entire film . It looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers , and it 's barely taller than Gandalf . " " Purists " " may prefer this Balrog , but I 'll take Jackson 's version any day . * The battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing . Almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments . I 'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson 's film , but they ARE supposed to be fighting . * Treebeard makes a very short appearance , and I was sorry he bothered to show up at all . Watch the film , you 'll see what I mean.Alright , now for the GOOD parts of the film . * Some of the voice acting is pretty good . It isn 't that Aragorn SOUNDS bad , he just looks kind of like the Jolly Green Giant . * Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal ; like Tom Bombadil , she seems immune to the Ring 's powers of temptation , and her voice actress isn 't horrible either . * Boromir 's death isn 't as heart wrenching as in Jackson 's portrayal of the same scene , but it 's still appropriately dramatic ( and more true to his death in the book , though I don 't believe Jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did ) . * As my professor pointed out ( between whispered threats ) , the orcs ( mainly at Helm 's Deep , if I 'm correct ) resemble the war-ravaged corpses of soldiers , a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what 's being attempted . * While this isn 't really a positive point about the film , Bakshi can 't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie , or so I 've been told--the project was on a tight budget , and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher-ups ( who I 'm sure hadn 't read the books ) .Let me be clear : I respect Bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude . I simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product . Overall , I cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien 's classic trilogy even for laughs , unless you 've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters , places and events . I 'm sure somebody , somewhere , will pick a copy of this up in confusion ; if you do , keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" If there were an EPA for film , then this movie would get their most sincere approval .

" Simply , I found the TV show " " Mash " " trite , preachy , oh ever so " " politically correct " , " repetitious , pretentious and biggest sin of all , and that is , ? that it is ( was ) incredibly dull . You have Alan Alda as the main lead , " " ( star ) " , " who is so in love with himself and his cleverness , that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode . The original series had both McLean Stevson , and Wayne Rogers , whom I 'll happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation . However , Harry ( Henry ) Morgan , and Mike Farrell , both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread . Loretta Swit , which I also found dull , also to no fault of her own wasn 't a wonder to look at , and Gary Burghoff , who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on . Seeing one show a year showed that to me . Jamie Farr was just low brow " " comedy " " and is not even worth really mentioning here at all . The reason I did not give it a ( one ) rating , which anyone reading this by now would be wondering , is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call , but a relative one . Television , except for relatively few exceptions , is such crud .

According to my wife ( who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room ) , it sounded like zombie porn .... which if you think about , sounds kinda gross ..... but it wasn 't even that good.The only suggestion I can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess.It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off .

A not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early Steven Seagal films because there is not a very good set piece . Steven Seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since Above the Law . In my opinion the performance of Keenen Ivory Wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film . Bob Gunton is okay as the main heavy . The best acting in the entire film belongs to Brian Cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer . My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian mafia . One of the film reasons to see The Glimmer Man ( 1996 ) is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and voluptupus Nikki Cox .

" This is a typical " " perfect crime " " thriller . A perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer , ignoring all the clues , immediately knows who guilty is .

" The director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of Matlock !

" The one reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after Nigel Kneale 's brilliant QUATERMASS serial was broadcast . The trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm which had me hoping he 'd be like Victor Caroon from THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT stalking the streets of London .No such luck because THE RACING GAME is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing . I suppose if you 're a fan of Dick Francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late 70s when THE SWEENEY had just finished and THE PROFESSIONALS was still being produced , there 's something lacking about THE RACING GAME . One trailer featured a car over taking another on a motor way , if it 'd been a trailer for THE SWEENEY you 'd see Jack Regan over taking a car and beating a confession out of the slags who 'd done a blag while THE PROFESSIONALS would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside .

" You know , I 'm getting really tired of all the generic music being used in these type of movies ( see Jawbreaker , Disturbing Behavior , etc ) . Every scene of genuine tension here ( and there is some ) is immediately undercut with some cheesy pop tune , completely diluting the suspense . Why do they do that ? To sell some soundtracks , of course , but in this case , mission unaccomplished - did anyone buy the CD ? And yeah , Ms. Mirren attacks her role with zest and relish ( with some cheez-wiz to add kick ) . But what are Molly , Leslie and Vivica doing here ? Their roles ( they 're so underused that I cannot use " " characters " " here ) have no purpose in the storyline , so I can 't figure out why three well-known actresses had been cast.Oh , and the ending is so unbelievably hackneyed and irresponsible . The kids get off scot-free and act as if nothing happened - all smiles at graduation . They 're criminals , people ! No consequences for their actions ( kidnapping , assault , grade tampering ) - nothing.Little things too - was Tingle 's tale about her husband true ? What 's with the crossbow ? Would the virginal Katie character loose her cherry on a whim like that ? ( Great message , guys . ) Why did McKean go to her home ? How did Kate 's academic nemesis walk through the door at that exact moment ? How do students even obtain teachers ' home addresses ? WHAT 'S WITH JEFFREY TAMBOR ? ? On what basis did McKean fire Tingle ? She 's bloodied , battered and held hostage by students , fer cripe 's sake !

" Possible Spoilers As Peter Jackson has so brilliantly shown in his ' Lord of the Rings ' trilogy , it is quite possible to make good films , even great ones , within the heroic fantasy genre . The genre has distinguished literary antecedents , dating back to the mediaeval chivalric romances , particularly the Arthurian legends , upon which Tolkien and other authors have drawn . ' Lord of the Rings ' apart , however , it is difficult to think of any other sword-and-sorcery films which are any good . I would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad bunch was Ron Howard 's ' Willow ' , and even that achieved little distinction other than that of being a merely mediocre film as opposed to a positively bad one . ' Red Sonja ' , however , cannot achieve the even more modest distinction of being simply a bad film as opposed to an appalling one.As with ' Willow ' , many of the plot-elements in ' Red Sonja ' are derived from ' The Lord of the Rings ' . An evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artefact with supernatural powers in order to achieve an ambition of world domination , but is thwarted by an assorted group of heroes . The film , set in the Hyborian Age , a barbaric era in the earth 's remote past , starts with the villain of the piece , the wicked Queen Gedren , making unwelcome sexual advances to the heroine Sonja . When these are rebuffed , Gedren ( not a woman to take no for an answer ) reacts by murdering Sonja 's parents and brother . ( In 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the chief villain a woman but also to make one of the main motives for her villainy frustrated lesbian lust ) .Gedren 's next move is to capture the Talisman , a sort of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers , by slaughtering the whole of the scantily-dressed female priesthood charged with protecting it , just as they are about to destroy it because they feel its powers have become too dangerous . Among the dead is Sonja 's sister , her sole surviving relative . Sonja herself , however , has not been idle , but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduates summa cum laude , and sets out to avenge herself . Along the way she teams up with Kalidor , a heroic wandering swordsman-king resembling Tolkien 's Aragorn , Prince Tarn , the spoilt child-ruler of a kingdom that has fallen to Gedren 's powers , and Falkon , Tarn 's loyal servant . The rest of the film is fairly predictable , as Sonja and her allies try to overthrow Gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out-of-control Talisman.Just what is it that makes this film so bad ? Well , the acting , for a start . Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kalidor gives the sort of typical wooden , poker-faced performance that became his trademark , at least in the early part of his career , complete with heavy foreign accent . Compared with Brigitte Nielsen as the heroine , however , he looks like Laurence Olivier . Miss Nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties , delivering every line in the mechanical , toneless voice of someone who has just completed lesson three of a ' teach-yourself-English-by-correspondence ' course . One wonders if she was hired for the role just to make Arnie look good by comparison . The other characters , while not conducting their own private struggles against the English language , are simply cartoonish caricatures , especially Prince Tarn who must be one of the most obnoxious screen youngsters ever.An even worse fault than the bad acting , however , is the film 's almost complete lack of imagination . This is a particularly glaring fault in a fantasy film , as films of this genre need to rely on their imaginative power in order to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be provoked by a fantastic plot . When we watch Peter Jackson 's masterpiece we can persuade ourselves , at least for the next three hours , that we are in Middle-Earth , that elves , wizards and hobbits do exist , and that the fate of the world really does depend upon the destruction of a magic ring . When we watch ' Red Sonja ' we are persuaded of nothing except that we are watching a bunch of actors with bad accents fighting one another on a hillside for possession of a lime-green football.This lack of imagination even starts with the film 's title . The British science-fiction author Brian Aldiss , when challenged about the exotic names given to his characters , replied that there was little point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were going to spoil the effect by calling the hero Joe . ( Admittedly , Tolkien was ableto get away with giving the name Sam to one of his main characters , but that was because Hobbits were supposed to be reassuringly familiar , the Middle-Earth equivalent of tweedy , pipe-smoking Englishmen ) . Similarly , giving the heroine of a tale ostensibly set in a long-gone barbaric age a common girls ' name like ' Sonia ' ( which is how the name ' Sonja ' is pronounced ) is about as appropriate as calling her ' Betty ' or ' Mary-Jane ' .The film seems to have been made on a very small budget , which makes me wonder why they bothered at all . Fantasy needs to be done convincingly , or not at all . It was obviously shot in a remote mountain area , with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture . The few buildings we see , such as the temple of the Talisman or Gedren 's palace , are obviously cheap sets . We learn that Tarn 's capital city has been destroyed by Gedren using the power of the Talisman , but we do not actually see this event ; all we see is what might be a thunderstorm taking place on the other side of a hill . At first you wonder how Sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies , but when you see how small an army Gedren has at her disposal it becomes more understandable . When an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace , you wonder if this is the Talisman at work or merely a crew member inadvertently leaning against the set . If we can enjoy this film for nothing else , we can at least enjoy it for its inadvertent humour ; a fine example of the so-bad-it 's-funny school of filmmaking . Ed Wood would have been proud of this one . If it had been shown on Californian television the night before the recall election , Gray Davis would still be governor . 2 / 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Why is this show so popular ? It 's beyond me why people like it . I think it 's one of the worst sitcoms out there . Because it 's so popular , I 've tried more than once to watch it and I can 't make it through an entire episode.For one thing , the acting is horrible . Everybody is overacting to the point where it 's annoying to watch . They talk in unnatural voices , use unnatural tones , and have unnatural body language . I 've seen better acting in a kindergarten school play.For another thing , it 's NOT FUNNY . The plots are dull . They 're not creative , intelligent , or FUNNY . Shouldn 't a sitcom be funny ? ? Why am I not laughing ? Lastly , what is seventies about this ? It 's about as authentic to the seventies as " " Happy Days " " was to the fifties.OH and what is up with Ashton Kutcher ?

" A college professor is working on creating zombies and , wouldn 't you know it , things go horribly wrong . Next thing you know , the whole campus is overrun . Thank goodness there 's a pair of uber-commandos trained for just such a situation . Too bad they must be accompanied by a group of moron-commandos , lead by a rapper ( he doesn 't even bother trying to play a military guy , he just responds to his superiors as if he were rappin ' wit ' da homies in da hood ) . The high point of this part of the movie is the locker room scene . The male and female moron-commandos share the same locker room , and apparently military regulations require all females to wear black bras and panties . Hey , if you can 't make a good movie , at least you can have women in their underwear . My hat 's off to the film makers.So , after much discussion of how well prepared these moron-commandos are for the job ( Bosnia , Afghanistan , Iraq ) , they all get killed off in fairly short order . Their biggest downfall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn any lights on . A typical encounter has them walking into a room and seeing someone at the far end . Human or zombie ? Can 't tell . Flip on the lights ? No , moron-commando protocol requires them to walk up to the person , making sure to hold their gun in such a way that it can be easily knocked out of their hand , and well , you know the drill . The demise of Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz is especially fun - my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie I 've ever seen . Luckily ( and again , hats off to the filmmakers ) , the hottest babe among the moron-commandos manages to survive . Her and the female uber-commando both wind up in tight T-shirts for the remainder of the movie . Now this is how a military operation should be performed ! There 's a bunch of running around , punctuated my humorous stuff like the uber-commandos being unable to get through a simple ventilator grating ( it obviously is a thin piece of aluminum that you could easily put your fist through ) . This necessitates a plan to rub zombie guts all over themselves , and even though we 've seen nothing in the movie to indicate that zombies locate their prey by smell , they 're good enough to immediately begin sniffing the zombie guts and let our heroes go.A few other funny bits - the Paris Hilton gag , the " " Can you hear me now ? " " gag , and the fact that although the zombies immediately bite secondary characters , main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being nibbled on . Another chuckle is provided by Mr. Fingaz , who can 't seem to pronounce the word ' tourniquet ' ( toe-no-kit ? ) .Overall , it 's somewhat amusing . Could have used some more interesting characters , but for a Sci-Fi Channel original , I was mildly impressed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a ' sneak preview ' at some of the old movies that are re-released on DVD , before you purchase them . That way you could save yourself some time , money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let down . " " The Buddy Holly Story " " is such a movie.I do not wish to go into the characterizations , or the holes in the plot , or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses , for I had already come to terms with them twenty years ago , when I first began watching it.I had recorded it on the old ( Monaural ) Beta machine back in the early 1980s , and liked it so much , that it became a regularly-played favourite . The best part , to my mind , was Gary Busey 's performance as the young Buddy , and his near-perfect vocals and guitar playing.I looked forward to the day when I could have it in ... STEREO ... , and that is where the disappointment comes in.This DVD version is ( supposedly ) re-mastered in both audio and video , according to the shell information , but I 'm afraid it left me sadly let-down and glancing at my watch , wishing for it to end.The sound is murky , bordering on the unintelligible , and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal-clarity vocals of my old Beta tape ! Despite what you think of the images , or the plot , or the characters , the real draw card here is the MUSIC ...... and if you can 't hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the cymbals , or the backing harmonies , or other ambients , then there 's not much left , is there ?

" I doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read Mansfield Park ... or if they have it was not very well . None of the characters are what they should be : Fanny is lively and conscious of her mistreatment , while Sir Thomas , who treated her very well , seems to have accidentally fallen into Aunt Norris ' personality . Additionally , a first person narrative by Fanny is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character . Fanny is not an entertaining heroine , and I would contend that she is not meant to be . Additionally , in the movie version , Fanny flirts shamelessly with Edmund from the very beginning , when they have been raised as brother and sister ! Austen 's Fanny would have shrank from flirtation of any sort , and the novel paints the Fanny / Edmund pairing as highly uncomfortable ... as it should be . Unlike some other Jane Austen novels ( P & P , Emma ) , Mansfield Park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist . It is a very different sort of novel than the others ; it is not meant to be a love story . I watched this movie because I have just now finished reading Mansfield Park , and I am absolutely horrified by what I see ; Miss Austen is rolling in her grave . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Okay , I guess I 'm pretty much a fan of spindled , mutilated , and destroyed Stephen King stories ( when they reach the ' Screen ' ) as any of us sad Masochists out here .

SOMETHING ! ! ! ? ? ? Okay , I admit that the actors in and of themselves were not too bad ( except Stephen King , of course : ) I liked the Shop guy , I thought both of the ' older ' people were fine .

" I saw this film over the weekend and while I was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of Church-produced films , I left disappointed that this one fell so short , failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questions.The film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of Joseph Smith . It 's not a true biopic because there 's no real coherent narrative . Most of the episodes concern Joseph doing good deeds , playing baseball , running races and laughing with children , often in sloooow motion . What a great , just folks kind of guy that Joseph was , huh ? Look at him out there beating rugs for his wife Emma . Well , howzbout the rugs of his 33 plural wives ? ? No mention whatsoever is made of polygamy . A glaring omission.And it is in such omissions where the film falters . It supplies too little information and leaves critical thinking audience members wondering WHY is Joseph getting tarred and feathered , WHY is he getting thrown in jail and WHY does that mob want to kill him ? The film 's climax is of course Joseph and Hyrum 's trek to Carthage jail ( riding past a veritable United Nations of faces looking out from Nauvoo 's doorways ) . But no mention is ever made about WHY . Nothing about Smith suppressing the Nauvoo Expositor newspaper and ordering its press destroyed for its revealing the secret teaching of polygamy . The audience is left to wonder or to assume it 's just more baseless persecution of the Church . No mention of Joseph being charged with treason for declaring martial law and calling out the Nauvoo militia.Of course I certainly did not expect this Church-produced film to present the Joseph of Richard Bushman 's recent biography Rough Stone Rolling , but I was surprised and taken aback at just how little of substance was actually presented.And worse , what substance that was presented was often inaccurate . Two examples jumped out at me . First , the translation of the Book of Mormon . The film shows Joseph reading right off the golden plates in their two-ring binder , which plates in reality were hidden far from the site . It 's well known that Joseph did his translating by burying his face in his hat , peering at the seer stone in there . The second inaccuracy occurs at Carthage jail , where the mob storms the cell . The History of the Church reports that Joseph had a six-shooter and even fired off a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the Masonic signal of distress ( as reported in Times & Seasons ) .Maybe showing the reality of the gunfight would have shattered the heart-tugging mood the filmmakers had created , but by omitting it they were unfaithful to history and failed to show Joseph as he really was : handy with a gun and able to defend himself . In fact , the impression the film gives is that Joseph was a nice guy , but also something of a milquetoast that everybody beat up , tossed in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood . He was far from that ; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardship and struggle to bring to fruition that in which he believed.See the film , but know going in that 's it 's cotton candy . Then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of Bushman 's biography of Smith , Rough Stone Rolling PS : Church-produced films have no credits , but seasoned eyes can pick out a couple familiar faces .

" William Shatner in small doses is tolerable .

I no longer watch the show , which is a shame , because the rest of the cast were good . It is pity that Shatner 's overdone role also , affects James Spader 's performance .

" P ' ( or Club-P ) should really be called ' L ' for lame . Every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much-hyped logline : " " Thai lesbians fighting monsters .

" " Well , guess what folks , the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a ' bar-girl ' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the ' foreign johns ' who pay for her services.While this film can 't even be released in Thailand due to it 's controversial subject matter most American audiences will find this ho-hum horror pic a cross between " " Showgirls " " and " " Interview with the Vampire " " as directed by Walt Disney.If not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the MPAA could probably rate this for pre-teens only . There is literally broadcast TV adult fare , although you 'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life.As for the ' lesbian ' angle , there 's one brief smooch and a couple of " " I love you 's " " to prove that the two main stars really are a couple ( on brother ) . And the P-bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts ( there 's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl 's mouth ... ooh , phallic imagery ) .NO nudity , NO real monster ( unless you count a five foot high Thai spirit with yellow eyes ) , and no way any ADULT should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD .

In Dead Man 's Walk the boys are believable as the younger versions of the experienced Texas rangers . In Comanche Moon they are just a couple of chubby rednecks . I had to stop watching.I suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinking pile . It 's a sorry end to an otherwise great franchise . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My Score for this crap : 1 / 10 1 for the technical only . Everything else is very bad . Another film that makes no sense . Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission . While it 's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth , they are among the biggest liars on the planet , it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic . We must believe that taking people for morons . Perhaps it was reason to believe , since 99 % of the films are crap . Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios . When you look at the price we give Oscars , we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others . And oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense . But it was not for education and health . If you still want to listen to this s * * t , press super Fast Forward button ( at least 20X ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
... " a good script or director couldn 't fix.The original ' Poseidon Adventure ' was a story of human courage triumphing against terrific odds and personal tragedy . The survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength who would take anything God threw at him.The follow-up tries to recreate the mix but fails through a formulaic script and pedestrian direction . Irwin Allen may have been a great producer of disaster flicks , and done a fine job directing the action scenes in ' Towering Inferno ' , but he just can 't bring any human depth to his characters . If the characters aren 't credible any danger they face also falls flat.The script also tries to copy the original too obviously . So we have Peter Boyle doing the Ernest Borgnine thing by being tough and obnoxious ( but he has a tender heart ) ; Karl Malden is the Red Buttons moderating influence ( and is terminally ill for good measure ) ; Slim Pickens does the comic relief for Shelley Winters , and so on.To make the story more contemporary we have a rogue arms dealer ready to flog weapons-grade plutonium to the highest bidder . A really nasty piece of work who ruthlessly abandons wounded men ( the actors playing his henchmen were presumably paid as extras because they don 't seem to have any lines ) and has a woman shot in the back - what a cad ! Thank goodness the French rescue services made the hole in the Poseidon 's hull twice as large as in 1972 ( and on the other side of the propeller shaft ) so he could he get his goods out . And while we 're on the subject , how did they get the crates * to * the ... oh , forget it.I actually paid good money to see this when it was released . Given the film 's current reputation this may seem odd , but it actually got quite mixed reviews at the time . Some said it was junk , some said it was as exciting as the original . Never mind , nobody can be right all the time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of Suttersville . Despite warnings by the local sheriff , Murphy ( John Phillip Law ) , Old Man Prichard ( Richard Lynch ) a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible Wanted posters , and kooky superstitious Aunt Nelly ( Karen Black ) to stay out of the mine due to it 's notorious legend ( .. that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest 's ( Jeff Conaway ) daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft ) , these people only see the green , not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies . Finding the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact , they line their pockets and carrying cases , prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead . But , when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons , the obvious result will be gruesome death . Jeremiah Stone , as we see , is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up , the pickax underneath awaiting it 's master , with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition , his eyes aglow with wrath . This hapless group , hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead , will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax . Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle , directing it 's path straight into her neck . Another failed attempt to retreat has Stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree , his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm . Another , a local girl searching for her new friends , worried about their well being , receives the pickax buried into her stomach . Aunt Nelly informs those still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash .. and pays the price for relating such information . Will anybody survive ? Or , is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner ? Make-up effects artist and monster creator , John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story-telling , opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path . He provides just enough back story , and this is feeble at best , for the killer allowing special guest star , Karen Black ( .. oh how her career has sunken into the abyss ) to explain to the viewer about him . The story given to us has the miner holding a priest 's daughter hostage , threatening to execute her as the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action . Startling enough , Stone plants that pickax right into her back , with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan . Retreating to his domain , the mine shaft , Stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what 's his , the loot . Typical of most slashers in general , this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims , with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them . They are the usual group , from the city , trespassing unto unfamiliar territory , resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant . Like many of the later 80 's slashers , a good deal of the violence is off-screen . What is on screen , the minimal gore , is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly . The ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally ; he 's mostly shrouded in darkness , the victims ' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction . One thing 's for certain , stunt men were set on fire many times . At least three times , a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle . Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black 's former husband , Caleb , now living with a much younger , and dense , honey . Vernon Wells ( .. of The Road Warrior and Commando fame ) has the back story role of Jeremiah Stone as a human , still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in . John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff , welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods . Buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses , all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts , showing off their sleek and athletic figures , especially Elina Madison as easy-lay Roxann , always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk , Hayden ( Rick Majeske ) . Stephen Wastell ( The Ghosts of Edendale ) is Axl , a rather clumsy foil , used as a butt of many jokes including his " " dump in the woods " " scene and current unemployment status . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Very disappointing 7th chapter of this slowly dying series . Very evident that the budget was extremely low . This movie was made for one reason and one reason alone . To sell Puppet Master Toys ! Fans , such as myself of the series have decided , from what I have read and heard that the only one in the series worse than this is Curse of the Puppetmaster . In turn , turning us away from the series . Opting to make this a PG-13 film , for whatever reason , did not work in the films favor . The plot seemed almost to be there , but was easily lost in the steady stream of nonsense . The only film in the series worth watching , also directed by Decoteau is part 3 - Toulon 's Revenge.Granted , I do favor the scenery in the film . Yuck ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters , and I saw it in Japan . The film 's plot wasn 't my cup of tea as a high school sophomore , but I went to see it for the 3-D process . It had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it , though it never screened at the Post theater.The film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience , which was taken to absurd levels with later 3-D films.I don 't know whether this qualifies as a spoiler , but you 've been warned if it is . In many films of the time , actors would often work in front of a " " rear projection screen , " " where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment , such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage . This works well on regular films , but when seen in 3-D , they look like a flat scene behind the actors . There were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used , and it didn 't work well in the theaters . If seen in 3-D , it will constitute another disappointment.The film 's only importance is historical , since it was the first of its kind . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" True fans of film will love this authentic movie.I disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one-star and calling it unrealistic . While I don 't have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists , I 've spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave . I don 't know what the basis is for others ' comments that the film is " " unrealistic " . " The dialog is great.The low budget production value didn 't bother me a bit . I felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film . The focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy Hollywood propping or melodrama.I completely bought into the character 's motivations and reactions . The acting was believable and impressive for new and non-actors.If your idea of good film is Transformers or Fast & Furious , then skip it . If you enjoy good character driven dramas , then see it .

" Despite pretty bad reviews , I just had to give this film a go 혯 it does , after all , star HK super-babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars . Surely that 's worth checking out ? Well , as babe-fests go , Martial Angels is hard to beat . The eye candy is top quality . Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always , and of the rest of the girls , Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular.Unfortunately , if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits , it is an absolute stinker ! The story is weak , the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic . Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else.If Shu Qi is the only reason you 're contemplating seeing this one , you would be better off watching Sex and Zen 2 again ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Dirt on the " " mystery machine " " window make you see light from the lighting on the windows ... annoying . What else ... it 's so badly framed all the time it 's just make you want to scream at that lady directing there . I only directed short films , but I 'm pretty sure I 'd be way better than that directing a feature film .... the story is unbelievable , just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it 's gonna be pretty awful .

" This movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film . Dolph Friggin ' Lundren with a Japanese accent is funny enough , but add really corny buddy-buddy action to the mix , an eccentric and over-the-top villain , a clich챕d love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time , and you 've got yourself quite the little suicide-inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and , up till watching " " Showdown , " " had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch.I don 't know if it 's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle . There are constant references to male genitalia , and not by females , either . Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other 's manly parts , and in fact before going on a suicide spree , Brandon says to Dolphy , " " In case we don 't make it , I want to tell you , you have the biggest d--- I 've ever seen . " " Now , is this what a normal man would say to another man ? In an ACTION film no less ? And would you want those to be your _ dying words _ ? ? Later , there 's this gem : Dolph ( regarding the villain ) : " " I would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy . " " Brandon : " " Man , you 've got a fixation . " " As the guy at RuthlessReviews.com pointed out , " " Unfortunately , Dolph doesn 't respond with , ' I 've got a fixation ? I 've got a fixation ? !

" Underwoods goofy story about a young man ( Arquette ) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr . ( Nicholas ) . The film is written ridiculously , direction is odd , dialogues are out of place and scrambled , the actors didn 't do it much justice either , Arquette is annoying throughout , Ian Nicholas was nonexistent , Macy was decent , but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance , he was at least tolerable .

" Where do I begin , its one of the most frustrating movies I 've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid . A movie about a ghost inhabited bed ? ? The first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a Fabienne from Pulp Fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie . This is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story . Still though , if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early , having a strangulation is the way to do it . Fast forward to the present day , a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things , so far everything 's normal . Then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress , they realize they need a bed frame . This is where things get fishy , why didn 't they bring or buy a g * d damn bed frame before they got there ? We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesn 't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame , the door magically opens . They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved ... or so they thought . The rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe . The female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they 're bring tortured or tied up . ( one of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old , yuck ) The female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie . They find the friendly landlord murdered ( which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill ) and decide to get the hell out of dodge . While packing up , the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her.Well if you 've read this far you have to be thinking one thing ....... WHY THE HELL DIDN 'T THEY JUST THROW THE BEDFRAME OUT THE WINDOW ? ? ? ? Seriously , they never said anything about the actual house being haunted , just the bed .... so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on ? That 's why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than Sonny Corleone at a toll booth . The couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol " " oh lets give this place a chance honey " " scheme going , so props to that . Still though , me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minutes .... why didn 't they just throw the bed out ? Especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something.All in all its a near-watchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot ( to an extent ) but the solution is so simple you 're scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be ? The highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can 't shoot her like that.4 out of 10 ( a low budget porno The Man Show would love ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I was loaned this DVD by the director of a film I am working with , in which I play an actor who is playing Prospero . Knowing his own style , I did not expect anything resembling a " " classical " " interpretation of the text.What I have found is sometimes striking , sometimes evocative , but often meandering and tedious . Like most experimental music , I find that in films such as this , the building blocks of powerful film-making are crafted , even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format.Thus we have a Caliban who is more a clown than a threat , and who not even Miranda seems terribly afraid of ( which is odd , since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once ) . A Stefano and Trinculo who are more annoying than funny . An oddly young Prospero who looks like Amadeus . And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing.Interestingly enough , I do not have an issue with the way in which Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed . His stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate.I do not say that this is a bad film , but an experimental one . One that takes huge risks , but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the Tempest for its own sake . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Jack Frost 2 was a horrible , terrible , sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie . The original , was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste . And the snowman went around murdering people , and avoiding blow dryers like the plague . This , however , was a far cry from the quality of the original . It seems like this even had a lower-budget because for some reason , after an hour into this film , I still hadn 't seen the snowman . Some revenge he 's getting if he 's always in the form of Ice cubes with a cheesy voice-over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character .

" I got the DVD from the library in the expectation of getting a good idea of how things go on in the background at a major opera production . I have to say , I was very disappointed . The subject had so much potential . The sets in a Wagnerian production must , of necessity , be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience . Instead , what we get it a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around big items of scenery , vaguely help together with a commentary which failed to hold my attention . I found myself listening primarily to the background clips of music from operas . I was impressed by the sheer enormity of the effort required to put on such a production - that did come across fairly well and next time I am at the opera I am sure I will remember that part if this video - but was left feeling somewhat cheated by the lack of detailed commentary and explanation . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of the very worst films Clark Gable made . Only PARNELL was obviously worse . It is just so painfully clich챕d and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither Gable nor Jean Harlow should have been proud of making.Gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going ' to the slammer ( like the gangster talk ? ) . She holds out hope that he 'll do the right thing but he just leaves her there--unknown to either of them , gosh , that she 's " " in the family way " . " Eventually , the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending ! They seemed to have forgotten about Gable 's needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow . Leonard Maltin says " " the stars are at their best here " . " By what standard ? Best at producing unintended chuckles ? Gimme a break ! PS--after saying this , my wife thinks Leonard Maltin is going to find me and kick my butt . Hmmm . However , despite my comment , I think Mr. Maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet ( I hope that appeased him ) .UPDATE--2 / 2 / 08 . Because I disliked this film so much the first time ( especially the ridiculous ending ) , I decided to watch it once again . After all , sometimes when I watch a film again I like it much more and realize that I was a bit too harsh . While that has been the case with several films in recent months , I still disliked this film--even the second time . Most of it was not because of the first half of the film . In the first half , Harlow 's character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable . But when she was sent to prison , it was all clich챕s until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred . The bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb--it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons . I stand by my original review ( despite all the " " NOT HELPFULS " " ) and think that aside from PARNELL and possibly POLLY AT THE CIRCUS , it might just be the worst Gable film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren 't stories , but the way he tried to show time passing by ( the couple of joggers , who first appear jogging together , than jogging with a stroller ( sic ! ) , than the man alone ... ) and to link the " " adventures " " of the characters ( the final scene , with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff , and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying " " Oh , a boat ! " " ) were awful . At the same time , I liked the way he portrayed the middle-high class , even in an excessive way . I think it is a lousy movie .

" This film is pure , distilled , unadulterated boredom . I knew nothing of it before I entered the dark room , took my seat . I was seduced by the " " mysterious and suspenseful " " blurb on the poster I suppose . Also , Lena Headey is nice and unconventionally sexy , and Richard Jenkins is always a reliable guy to have around , so the cast seemed reasonable . It may have been his name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on . I should 've gone to see Valkyrie for the second time instead.The thin plot revolves around Headley 's Gina McVey , her boyfriend , her father , her sister and her sister 's husband who for some reason are being stalked , in a very louche and unenthusiastic manner , by their evil doppelgangers who emerge from mirrors that mysteriously smash . There could be a great film behind this idea ( not exactly an original idea , mind you , but still ... ) and in fact , if the filmmakers had shorn away all the supporting cast and simply stuck to Headey 's character 's story , The Broken could 've made a reasonable 20-minute short . As it is , it is desperately unmotivated and boring , and terribly inconsistent.For instance , in one scene , a mirror smashes on its own in a room housing all the main characters ; they look puzzled but quickly forget about it . In another scene , a mirror smashes in an empty room , and a doppelganger is visible as she " " steps out " " of the shards left hanging on the wall . So why did the first mirror smash if no creepy crawly was to come crawling out ? Just for a little thrill ? There are far too many scenes of the characters in the dimly-lit London flats , peering around corners cos they thought they heard something , but seeing nothing there and moving on . We begin to wonder , why doesn 't this malevolent doppelgang actually ever want to try to scare them ? Scare the characters and you have a chance of scaring the audience . But we , the audience , will need to start threatening each other , in the darkness of the theater , if we want to have any thrills during The Broken . By the way , once we 've spent time with these evil doubles , we are totally bemused as to why anyone should be expected to be frightened of them - they just stand around , blank looks on their faces , perhaps totally harmless after killing their others.There are some nice moods and touches throughout , and I dare say director Sean Ellis could fashion a genuinely stylish and suspenseful mystery movie if he was to hire an imaginative screenwriter next time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * * HERE BE SPOILERS * * The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program , now called UniSol . The soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before . However the government is downsizing , the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened , so he takes steps to ensure his own safety . He activates and controls the UniSols and start to run mayhem . The only one who can stop them is Deveraux ( Van Damme ) . This movie is about one thing . Choreographed fighting . The story is bad , and is soon drowned in all fights . Whatever happens , and wherever they go , they fight . Unfortunately for this movie , it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible . Normally you 're pretty sure the hero will win , but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants . Not where one is indestructible and can 't lose . Then the fights just become a tool to stretch time . You wait until the final fight when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes . To further lower my opinion , a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are . Well , there aren 't really that lot of them , because the characters are most men ( there are at least one woman UniSol though ) , but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once . The female leads get by with this , but we also pass through a strip-club ( to use a computer no less ) with much more undressed women . These moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent-minded male audience.So , in conclusion , boring fights . No more , no less . Well , maybe less ... 2 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I look back on my college days at Ohio University , there will always be one event in which I will remember with fond memories . Channel 23 is OU 's local access channel and until the last few years , pretty much played anything they were sent . This included many DIY movies ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow Peeps and then scanning pictures of them online , to a version of Macbeth starring 8th graders who had apparently just learned how to make squibs.However , the king , in my opinion , of the channel 23 lineup was Midnight Skater . The first time I watched it was around 2AM . I should have been studying . Or sleeping . Or watching regular TV . But no , all that is for pussies . My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater , and when it was complete , I don 't think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened . But sure enough , it was on a few nights later , and we had to come to grips that this movie did , in fact , exist.I could go on and on about how awful it is , but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living . The plot is disjointed , the acting terrible , the everything soul scarring , but by god , if there are others watching with you , its impossible not to have a good time watching it . Its sort of like the first time you hear " " Guts " " by Chuck Pahalniuk . You hear it , you 're disgusted and shaken , but five minutes later , all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the abject horror you just endured.Long story short , Midnight Skater , for all of its epic flaws , makes for some very late night fun . Plus , I desperately want the Theme to Midnight Skater . Kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it . Sweet God I love that song . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A poorly-paced sf / horror venture that takes itself much too seriously , memorable only for ( a ) the beautiful Mathilda May wandering around naked through the chaos and ( b ) terrible miscasting .

" Joe Don Baker is ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo , a pudgy , sweaty murderous oaf in a stupid cowboy suit that Roy Rogers would have laughed at . Somehow he still has a badge , probably because he lives in Texas and they 'll let ANYTHING be law enforcement there.This greasy loser is a deputy sheriff near the Texas border . Not surprisingly , he was once a Texas Ranger but got kicked out because he seemed to think that the law was his own personal bouncing ball to be played with at his discretion . This includes shooting suspects who are over the international border into Mexico , beating up on suspects , cheating in gun fights , threatening women , starting gunfights that could have been avoided AND managing to get the life of a child threatened in the process , letting women he promised he would help and protect get killed just so that he could get out of jail , etc , etc . This guy makes L.A. cops look like saints in comparison.When his partner is killed by a pair of wandering Italian assassins , Joe Don 's character hunts them down and kills one of them . Then he takes the other to Italy at the behest of a Mr. Wilson , who rightly thinks that Joe Don will screw up big time . In record time , he loses the Italian and gets a Maltese cabby blown up in the process . This is just the first of the many deaths and major destruction that Joe Don leaves in a trail behind him as he rampages across Malta looking for Palermo ( the Italian assassin ) .Thus begins the mobius strip part of the movie , in which our hero gets arrested , lectured by the Maltese chief of police , goes out and causes more trouble , gets arrested , gets lectured by the chief of police ... and so on , and so on . Until you want to blow your brains out with Joe Don 's ivory handled pistol and be done with the horror.Joe Don proves his uselessness not just in the first time Palermo escapes , but in the subsequent boat chase in which he goes down in just one punch . Then he gets taken by Palermo after he threatens a woman with a coat hanger . You hope that Palermo will actually get to torture him in the basement cell he 's put in , but no-the stripper he threatened came and got him out , because he promised to protect her . Her throat promptly gets cut ( big surprise ) and Joe Don escapes into the night.And here you hope he might have been drowned in the ( yet another ) boat chase . But even the ocean doesn 't want him , and spits him up on a shore where he 's nursed by a poor Maltese family ( what did they ever do to deserve that ? ) he returns to the city , where he 's arrested by the police , lectured by the police chief ... arrrgghhh ! The female police officer who 's been escorting him around frees him so that they can go get Palermo . Why she would do anything so brain dead as to destroy her career for this great slob is beyond me . It 's just head scratchily puzzling.They go out to the villa where Palermo is hiding , and start a shoot out . Joe Don blithely cheats , and kills Palermo . He then utters the great and dazzling last line of the movie : " " The big one has my badge . Can you go get it for me ? " " Thank you for that immortal line , Mr. Baker . That will go down in the annals of movie history as the most literate , amazing , wondrous last line ever uttered by a character in a film . It certainly falls into line with everything else about the character . Bravo . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you see this film in the TV listings just ignore it . If you 're looking for something scary you 'll be better off watching reruns of the X-Files.Previous comments referencing the incredibly poor acting by the female lead are dead on . She is almost unwatchable . The sum total of her range includes ' whiny and scared ' and ' whiny and not scared ' .I am the kind of movie buff who enjoys a good ' bad ' movie . But this is ridiculous . There is no direction . The plot is as simplistic as the set of numbers they keep throwing at you and much like that set of numbers , it ends up having no meaning in the end.Your time will be better spent if you turn off the TV and give your dog a bath . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Willies starts late one night as brother 's Josh ( Joshua Miller ) & Kyle ( Jason Horst ) are camping outside with their cousin Michael ( Sean Astin ) , they decide to pass the time by telling scary stories ... First up is Michael with a story entitled ' Bad Apples ' in which a young boy named Danny Hollister ( Ian Fried ) is bullied at school , however the sinister new janitor Mr. Jenkins ( James Karen ) decides to help him out ... Next up is Kyle as he tells a strange story called ' Flyboy ' in which an overweight bully with a worrying fascination with dead flies gets what he deserves in a horrible twisted way ... Written & directed by Brian Peck The Willies didn 't do much for me & I doubt it 'll do much for you either . The script is strange as far as episodic anthologies go , instead of the usual three or four stories it only has two main tales & a few bizarre ' urban myth ' type mini scenes at the start , these consist of the person who orders food from a fast food restaurant only to find a dead rat in her chicken , a man who dies of a heart attack on a ride & someone who tries to dry her poodle off in the microwave only for it to explode . I have no idea what the purpose of these scenes are but they add nothing to the film , as for the two main stories they are both weak . For a start they are too long which is a huge mistake in these types of films , usually the stories in anthologies are short , sharp & quick with a nice twist at the end usually involving people getting what they deserved . However in The Willies the stories last for the best part of 40 minutes each which is longer than the average TV episode & I must admit I found both stories very boring , they have very little going for them & seem to be aimed at children . The first story is the better to watch as a whole but it has no twist ending as far as I could see while the second one has a nice ' just deserts ' ending but the build up to it is weak & drawn out for no good reason . I really like horror anthology films so The Willies comes as a disappointment , frankly it lets the genre down.Director Peck was obviously working on a low budget & as a whole The Willies is pretty tough to sit through , there 's plenty of continuity errors & it 's poorly made . There 's no atmosphere , there 's no scares , there 's no gore , the special effects are poor & it features unnecessary shots of a dirty toilet several times . Overall it 's a pretty unappealing film to sit through.Technically The Willies is rough around the edges to say the least , the effects are far from special & it has an extremely drab & grainy look to the picture . The acting is poor , no ones going to win any awards thats for sure.The Willies is a poor film , it 's not scary , it 's not fun , it 's not entertaining & it only features two overlong stories . Definitely not recommended . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick . Speakman 's considerable kempo skill ( nice spin kicks , decent with the sticks - poor couch ! ) is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting . The plot isn 't half bad ; just executed pretty poorly . But if you 're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts , you 're missing the boat entirely . And for a movie that is supposed to take place in Koreatown , way way too few Korean actors ( even extras ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be ' unredeemable ' I will state the following without repeating the obvious FLAWS plainly stated by some of the other commentators : The " " film " " is shot on video ( what type of camera I don 't know ) but the cameraman had it on AUTOFOCUS ( ! ) all the time , so that any slight movement makes it go In and Out of focus . In many of the scenes the actors themselves go OUT of focus for their scenes . This alone screams " " Amateur " . " I also noticed that out in the ' middle of the cornfield ' , you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is powering the lights ... loudly.Also what is with that single lighting source that follows ( and many times ' leads ' the actors ) when they walk around . It looks like a newscaster with that ' on camera light ' that follows the people around like a spotlight . There was no ' credit ' for lighting design / DP and I know why . The ' filmmakers ' saw no need to have someone who actually knew what they were doing lighting this picture ( note I didn 't say " " film " " ) . So be prepared for a SINGLE glaring spotlight as the sole source of ' cinematic lighting ' for most of the movie . UGhhh ! ! ! This is probably the most technically inept production I 've ever seen commercially released . I " " bought " " this title because I like bad cinema . Usually it 's so bad that you can laugh at it . This is just so bad that it 's unwatchable . Plan Nine from Outer Space is " " Citizen Kane " " in comparison to this title . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Steven Vasquez directed and co-wrote with James Townsend , the star , this strange little drama cum horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions : make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller . So why doesn 't it work ? For starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather aimlessly throughout the film , dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting sidetracked into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters . Not that that is a bad thing : it can certainly enhance some films that have been Hollywood successes . The film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women , relationships , disturbed parenting , the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events - and murder . It is all a bit much to cram into a 96-minute film.Devon ( James Townsend ) by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend Jenna ( Sarah Kelly ) but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets Brian ( Alex Wilson ) who has been down the same path and can offer Devon assistance on every level . They bond , Devon comes out , and the mysteries begin : boys are missing in the neighborhood , Devon 's stepfather psychologist Dr. Kirk Tyler ( Dan Swett ) is not at all what he appears to be and despite Devon 's consoling mother Donna ( Sonja Fisher ) Devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship . It seems Dr Tyler is in a dark business with hunky Detective Cunningham ( Earl McDougle ) who apparently is investigating the missing boys ... Devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend Jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of Dr. Tyler and his detective sidekick . And through it all Donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy , etc.Some of the actors are pleasing to the eye ( and there is very little the eye doesn 't examine frequently ! ) but the degree of acting is at an all time low . The only thing that makes us forgive that ( and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive ) is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved . Yes , this is a low budget movie and yes , the director needs time to learn his trade . But in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level . Maybe their next one will be more polished .

" Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending I get really angry about ... lets just say its not my cup of tea , just like the dime store romances are not my cup of tea.The plot has a doctor stopping at an inn and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with . He goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life.Well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line . This is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women swoon and the men shake their head in disbelief . I wouldn 't be so adverse to the film as a mindless romance , except that the film takes a turn in the final reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable . Why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this ? It really ruined it for me.If you like romance give it a shot , though wait for cable . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I like musicals but as a Dickens fan I HATE this one . * * MILD SPOILERS * * Starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse ? The poor of London coming out to sing ? Fagin and Dodger walking off into the sunset ? Not exactly faithful to the novel . As I recall , Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in prison . * * END OF SPOILERS * * Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes , doing little more than growling to indicate his evil . Worst however , is Mark Lester as Oliver , who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he 's really the main character . His portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl . Guess they didn 't realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in England.Self-respecting Dickens fans : stick to David Lean 's amazing 1948 film or the BBC 6-hour adaptation from the mid-80 's . Avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was amongst the worst films I have ever encountered . The cinematography was dull , with long tedious shots ( like a camera on a tripod filming a stage play ) interspersed with " " dramatic " " angles that made little sense to the content on screen . The editing was terrible , scenes matched together with the delicacy of a butcher . The plot hinged on the viewer being familiar with the historical night in which Mary Shelley wrote frankenstien .

" This is only the second time I stopped a video / DVD part way through.I was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first , even though it managed to be both shallow , clich챕d and stupid .. AND joyless , plodding and pretentious.It was like an After School Special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him ... creepy and sad , with voice-over narration that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry ... and some singing , and ... no , really , the poor child 's suffering ... Enough , already , especially when it morphed into a brazen , clumsy , and insulting Clockwork Orange ripoff . And did I mention the singing ?

" [ * * * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * * * ] This movie 's reputation precedes it , so it was with anticipation that I sat down to watch it in letterbox on TCM . What a major disappointment.The cast is superb and the production values are first-rate , but the characters are without depth , the plot is thin , and the whole thing goes on too long . For a movie that deals with alcoholism , family divisions , unfaithfulness , gambling , and sexual repression , the movie is curiously flat , prosaic , lifeless , and cliche-ridden . One example is the portrayal of Frank Hirsch 's unfaithfuness : his rather heavy-handed request to his wife to " " go upstairs and relax a bit " " followed by her predictable pleading of a headache , leads - even more predictably - to his evening liaison with his secretary ( " " hey Nancy , I 've got the blues tonight . Let 's go for a drive " " ) , all according to well-worn formula . We don 't feel these are real people , but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play . Also , the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained . Dave 's infatuation with the on-again / off-again Gwen is inexplicable in light of her fatuous inability to defecate or get off the pot . His subsequent marriage of desperation to the Shirley Maclaine / Ginny character is , from the moment of its being presented to this viewer , anyway , obviously doomed to fail , and it was clear - by the conventions of this type of soap opera - that it could only be resolved by someone being killed . The moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun I started a bet with myself as to who - Dave or Ginny - would get killed . The whole thing was phony with a capital ' P ' . Having said that , Maclaine 's performance and that of Dean Martin are the standouts here . But on the whole I find the movie 's interest to be purely that of a period piece of Hollywood history . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The sound is terrible , the picture is worse than worse , the acting is awful , the female leading actress is chubby , and the story is ... wait a minute ... There is no story ... ! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading . If you expect to to see Piranhas , you might be disappointed . This movie has nothing to do with the Piranha movies from 1978 and 1981 . Actually , I can only think of one scene involving Piranhas.The only thing that I liked about this movie , besides the fact that it runs for only about 85 minutes , is the song at the end . It 's written and sung by Jim Stein and it 's called " " Love all things that love the sun " . " I don 't recommend this movie . It is so bad it 's not even funny to watch .

" I suppose I should be fair and point out that I don 't believe in ghosts . That said , I 'm very interested in the subject and I enjoy a scary story as much as the next guy . I am a fan of Ghost Hunters because they at least try to give their investigations a scientific angle . Even early episodes of Most Haunted had a camp entertainment factor to them . Paranormal State has neither of these qualities . The cases themselves have the potential to be interesting , but as with so much " " reality TV " " these days , it suffers from overproduction , poor acting and silly scripts . The makers of the show freely admit that writers " " guide " " the stories . I hear they are even going to shoehorn in a romance subplot to appeal to the young female demographic . The show has many other flaws too . As others have stated , the narration quickly becomes like nails down a chalkboard . Over the top visual and audio effects quickly become just as irritating . I 'm willing to suspend some disbelief for the sake of entertainment , but this whole " " demon with a vendetta " " story arc is just ridiculous . Given that the producers of this show are also responsible for brain dead fodder like MTV 's Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor I suppose this is really no surprise . If you are a die hard fan of Ed & Lorraine Warren or a big " " reality " " show junkie I guess you 'll find much to like in Paranormal State . For the rest of us ....

" I just finished reading Forsyth 's novel ' Icon ' . I thought it was one of the most in depth , detailed , and page-turning books I ever read , definitely in my top 10 . I acquired a DVD version of the book starring Mr. Swayze . OK , let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel into 2.5 hours film time would of been impossible , so I understand the teams reason to sway from the book version and differ . However , when I say " " differ " " what I really should say is " " take the characters from the book , add a few , leave a few out , take away the book 's plot , add a modern new plot , add Frederick Forsyth 's name in there somewhere " . " Im not saying this was a bad picture , far from it , some of the effects were top notch and the acting wasn 't half bad . The story sucked and didn 't rely on logic or reality . Forsyth 's novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them .. This could of been so much more if it had taken its time and been made into say a 10 part series .

" This is just dreadful . I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this dreck . I think it 's supposed to be a comedy , but I don 't remember laughing much , except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors.An unattractive middle-aged man called Lester meets up with rich unattractive middle-aged women via lonely hearts ads , and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction . That 's the whole plot , and that 's really all that happens . Along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when Lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about knowing his secret , but its so badly implemented , you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening . The sequences in which Lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies . One sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then shoved into an oven . It 's very cruelly depicted , but it is played out against blaring big-band waltz music , with Lester pulling faces and adopting comedy poses throughout . Another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs ... you have to see this to believe it ! Actually - you don 't have to see it at all , in fact I strongly recommend you avoid this flop . Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there 's no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career . One sequence stood out to me as particularly wretched : the revelation when Lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow . Fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this phenomena on screen , so from this point on he just films the actor as normal , shadow and all ! ! And thus totally blows the whole angle . Either he had zero budget for effects , or he just didn 't care enough to think up any way of showing it . Whatever it was , that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is . I couldn 't even understand most of the film , and there certainly wasn 't anything on screen worth looking at half the time . Even the ending was as flat as a pancake .

" I watched Grendel the other night and am compelled to put together a Public Service Announcement.Grendel is another version of Beowulf , the thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic poem . The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of inoffensive and uninteresting movies , and the previews promised an inauthentic low-budget mini-epic , but this one refused to let me switch channels . It was staggeringly , overwhelmingly , bad . I watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you couldn 't tear your eyes away from . I reached for a notepad and managed to capture part of what I was seeing . The following may contain spoilers or might just save your sanity . You 've been warned.- Just to get it over with , Beowulf 's warriors wore horned helmets . Trivial issue compared to what came after . It also appears that the helmets were in a bin and handed to whichever actor wandered by next . Fit , appearance and function were apparently irrelevant.- Marina Sirtis had obviously been blackmailed into doing the movie by the Ringling Brothers , Barnum and Bailey circus . She managed to avoid a red rubber nose , but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup.- Ben Cross pretended not to be embarrassed as the king . His character , Hrothgar , must have become king of the Danes only minutes before the film opened and hadn 't had a chance to get the crown resized to fit him yet.- To facilitate the actors ' return to their day jobs waiting tables , none were required to change their hairstyles at all . The variety of hair included cornrows , sideburns , buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialog . To prove it was a multi-national cast , all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chose.- As is typical with this type of movie ( at least since Mad Max ) , leather armor was a requirement . In this case it was odd-shaped , ill-fitting and brand-new.- The female love interest , Ingrid , played by Alexis Peters , followed a long-standing tradition of hotties who should be watched with the volume turned completely down.- The unintended focus of the movie was a repeating , compound crossbow with exploding bolts . It never needed to be loaded and even had a recoil when fired . It managed to shred the laws of physics , the integrity of the original legend , historical fact and plot suspense all by itself.- Hrothgar 's palace , Heorot , rather than being a Norse long hall , apparently was designed and constructed by artisans who sank with Atlantis.- Beowulf arrived at the Danes ' homeland in a two-masted stern-castled ship that originally was part of a set , the other two being the Santa Maria and the Pinta.- Prince Unferth observed Beowulf 's ship 's approach using a telescope . Before you could recover from that astounding innovation , you got to see the ship from his point of view . Judging from the angle , the prince was in an aircraft of some sort.- Fun fact 1 : In Bulgaria , fire ( as from a fireplace ) creates light without heat . This explains why you could see the actors ' breath whether indoors or out.- Fun fact 2 : Dark Age dancing in Denmark looks like slow dances I went to in the 8th grade.- Fun fact 3 : You , too , can make a catapult with a timed-release air-burst explosive . But , don 't expect it to actually harm anything . Incidentally , Beowulf was apparently a veteran of World War II , yelling " " Incoming ! " " to shred any remaining suspension of disbelief.- Grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely CGI creation he couldn 't leave footprints . Even in snow.- Grendel 's mom ( " " Hag " " ) was in a foul mood because she was a single mother and junior hadn 't inherited her wings . Recessive gene , I suppose . By the way , we can now make an educated guess that Grendel 's pop was probably Swamp Thing.- Grendel and mom chose to randomly kill , fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few pages of the script.- Fun medical fact : Being slammed by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown fifty feet against stone causes slight facial scratches that don 't bleed much.- The sword of legend Beowulf used to dispatch the Hag was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge . Luckily the wobbling dispelled any concerns over its weight.- Best line of the movie : Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spit a quart of blood roughly six feet . Princess Ingrid cradled him gently and said , " " You 're going to be okay , my prince . " " So much for that job at the triage clinic.I feel better now . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OK , so it 's a silly movie , but I think they knew that when they made it . And there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired , overdone " " Godzilla " " -type genre .

" This show was rushed , and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials ( When it came back from commercial , the noise or " " surprise " " was something simple like a mouse ) This is a pure rip-off of Ghost Hunters and it attempts to go " " beyond " " them , and fails miserably . Also , what is with the Directors log thing ? Is this star trek ? It just ruins the novelty of this show , which wore off quick . The only reason it 's been watched is that people want to laugh at the pure anti-climatic nature of it . They never find anything , and most likely never will . Funnily enough , they always point out something that is the thing they are " " hunting " " and guess what ? ! It 's the local radio station 's tower light that is blinking red ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Silly , simplistic , and short , GUN CRAZY ( VOLUME 1 : A WOMAN FROM NOWHERE ) goes nowhere.This brief ( just over sixty minutes ) tale isn 't so much inspired by the classic spaghetti Westerns as it is a rip-off of Sam Raimi 's THE QUICK & THE DEAD ( his admitted homage to the spaghetti Westerns ) brought into a contemporary setting . In QUICK & DEAD , Sharon Stone 's character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff ( played by Gene Hackman ) who , when she was but an urchin , placed the fate of her father ( a brief cameo by Gary Sinise ) in her hands ; she accidentally shot him through the head . In GUN CRAZY , Saki ( played by the nimble Ryoko Yonekura ) seeks revenge against the dastardly Mr. Tojo ( played with minimalist appeal by Shingo Tsurumi ) , who , when she was but an urchin , placed the fate of her father in her hands ; she let her foot slip off the clutch , and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck . The only significant difference , despite the settings , is the fact that Tojo sadistically cripples Saki with 혚 well , I won 't spoil that for you in case you decide to watch it.In short , Saki 혯 a pale imitation of the Clint Eastwood 's ' Man With No Name ' 혯 rides into the town 혯 basically , there 's a auto shop and a tavern alongside an American military base , so I guess that suffices for a town 혯 corrupted by Tojo , the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored . Confessing her true self as a bounty hunter , Saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of Johnny To and John Woo . Of course , by the end of the film Saki has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys , but she rises to the occasion 혯 on her knees , in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending 혯 and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcher.Don 't ask where she gets the rocket launcher . Just watch it for yourself . Try not to laugh.The image quality is average for the DVD release . There is a grainy quality to several sequences , but , all in all , this isn 't a bad transfer . The sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times , but , again , it isn 't a bad transfer.Rather , it 's a bad film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A man wakes from a nightmare about bats . He and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon . He seems to hear a strange noise , and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket . He wants to go on a tour of a cave , which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing , but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon . She relents . They go on the tour , but leave the group to make out . She falls down a slope , where she is disturbed by insects . He follows her . He hears the strange noise again , and seems to know a bat is approaching ; one does , and gets in her hair . He fights it off her , and it attacks him , biting his forehead.They get out of the cave , but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort , he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people . He becomes angry when this happens . He 's unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out . His wife worries about rabies , and he starts a Pasteur treatment for that , but reacts violently to the injection.And then some people are killed . We see parts of the man 's transformation into a bat person . It seems it is not just in his mind . Whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear , since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite.While the title seems inappropriate , the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person . Not a very good movie , but I liked the variety of the desert , cave , and ski-slope locations , and some of the weirder scenes . I didn 't think this was as bad as other people do , and I didn 't think the 1999 movie Bats was as bad as others think either ( I rated that one a 5 / 10 ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was terrible . The first half hour is much like a ... well , apologies for the lack of articulation , but it was simply a bad version of A Clockwork Orange . The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork ! Supposedly it was a tribute , as per the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the protagonist 's wall , however " " ripoff " " is the more appropriate word . The movie felt as though it was torn right from the Kubrick classic , only filmed through a new director 's eyes . A blind director . Unfortunately when it stops its massacre of Kubrick 's work , the film gets even worse . As another commentator said , the deepness of this film is just shoved down your throat . Arrogant , self absorbed and ultimately meaningless drivel.Perhaps the protagonists ramblings would touch a nerve if there was any actual character development in this movie . I felt absolutely nothing for this guy . And I 'm an alcoholic , so I figure that if anyone might be able to feel anything for him , it would be me . Awful character development , dialogue and plot.The worst part about this movie is the title . For a film called " " 16 Years of Alcohol " , " the alcoholism is hardly a factor in the flick . See first paragraph - it was such a butchering of A Clockwork Orange I can 't get over it . A more suited title would have been " " 16 Years of Violence , " " or , even better , " " A Clockwork Banana " . " Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie . If you disregard my advice and take it out anyway , drink . Trust me . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I don 't know what Margaret Atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book . I 've always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works . I am aware that the translation of book to movie isn 't perfect but this movie was the worst ever . The names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it . I feel like I lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie . This really should have been a mini-series to tell the story the way it was written.The actors for Roz , Tony , Charis and Zenia were well-chosen even though I was skeptical at first about Mary-Louise Parker . I only wish they 'd had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ( Chances are , I 'm gonna spoil Valuable Plot Points while writing this and because I can 't determine and don 't really care what YOU think is a Valuable Plot Point , then if you are thinking of watching this film and have an issue with learning such things , then I suggest you hop right on to the next review . ) You know , I don 't mind the cult films being filed under the " " cult " " section . And people who believe it can go there and get their fill of the " " reality " . " I mean , is it too much to ask that the overtly pseudo-Christian propaganda films be filed with the other Special Interest movies ? I couldn 't have been more flabbergasted had Pat Robertson made a porn movie . ( or would that be " " flubbergasted " " ? ) It was bad enough that there was an egregiously insufficient count of kicking and punching in this . It was bad enough that the same story has been done repeatedly in much better ways . It was bad enough that it wasn 't filed under Special Interest , with other cult films . It was bad enough that it somehow is receiving nods for being " " realistic " " as if we live in the world where towns get possessed by the " " debbil " " and the really profound and nasty evil ISN 'T done by human beings -- usually in the NAME of religions based on the god of Abraham . It was bad enough having to simply shut the thing down because people were complaining so loudly that it was awful.No , the really BAD part was when one of our guests stood up after we finally had to just turn the damn thing off , and declared " " I for one would like to see something really violent or pornographic now , just to get that OUT of my head . Preferably both , if you have it . " " And we had just MET her . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Curiously , Season 6 of the Columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts , based on this outing for the " " man-in-the-mac " " and also " " Fade into Murder " . " Furthermore , it is not a coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts ( incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here ) .This adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material . The story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversation.Columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here ( similar to " " Last Salute to the Commodore " " ) but the entertainment value is minimal . To add to this , Celeste 's Holm characterisation , which is intended to provide comedy , induces embarrassment rather than laughs.The script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift Columbo the case , though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime.Ironically , what turns out to be , arguably , Columbo 's worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series . He quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut / manicure at the same time . The next 5 minutes are hilarious - it 's just that Columbo 's hair is so perfectly groomed , then he can 't afford to pay the bill and then , when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle ! Sadly , this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes . For Columbo completionists only . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" What ever possessed Martin Scorcese to remake this film ? And not only did he remake it , completely ruin it ? The nonsensical decision to make the character played by Robert DeNiro ( in his most overdone performance , and that 's saying a lot ) into a religious fanatic is ridiculous , and exemplary of attitudes harbored by Hollywood ( and Mr. Scorcese especially ) - attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back . In any case , this movie is awful . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ( SMALL SPOILERS ) I just bought the DVD of this movie yesterday . I saw it with my friends and I couldn 't believe what had happened.In the first 3 movies , the critters at least had a sense of humor ( especially the 3rd movie ) , but not only did the critters barely ever make an appearance , they weren 't funny ! They never made me laugh . I must admit that the story did start off nicely . After an hour had gone by I remembered that the Critters movies were always very short . So I thought to myself , " " Where the $ ^ % # $ are the critters ? ! ? ! " " They were barely in this movie ! If that didn 't make me mad enough , the boy named Ethan was sitting on his bed after Charlie had " " murdered the ship " " and he knew that the critters were still on board ! In the first movie the Brown family was scared out of their minds . But here , Ethan didn 't even care ! It was as if the critters weren 't even a threat ! Now what I 'm about to say next may ruin the ending , but I 'm going to say it anyways . In the first movie , at the end , they had to face the giant critter for a final battle . In the second one , there was the great ball of critter . In the third movie , the critter with his fave burned did a spindash ( from Sonic the Hedgehog ) and was going to attack the little kid . But at the end of the fourth one ( which is what made me the angriest ) the bald critter charges toward Ethan , and Ethan kills it as if it were nothing.Now something that I really don 't understand was what happened to Ug . He was one of my favorite characters in the first two . Then after 50 years , he 's evil . That was very disappointing . Not only that , but wasn 't he a faceless bounty hunter ? Why was he still " " Johnny Steele ? " " Plus he seemed to have a different personality . He seemed much smarter and not as monotone like in the first two.Being someone who actually enjoyed the first two critters movies , and loved the third one , I give Critters 4 a 2 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released . The dialog was unnatural . Especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father . I guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog , but what was said seemed false and artificial . The suspense just wasn 't there . The music was about as bad as it gets . The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen . Fortunately the movie was on TV and so I didn 't waste any money renting this sorry excuse for a film ! I honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than was presented here . It 's too bad that the time of an entire film crew was wasted on such trash ! I guess the only positive thing I can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I checked out the review for this film after I 'd watched it , I was surprised that there were people giving it good ratings.This is a film of bad camera-work . Everything ' frightening ' happens off screen , usually accompanied with a closeup of someone yelling " " Did you see / hear that ? " " Well , no , we didn 't see that ! We can 't ! And when there weren 't any close-ups , the camera was doing something weird like rotating upside down , or shaking back and forth really , really quickly , to either convey action or to make us physically sick.The characters were unlikeable because every two minutes , they started screaming the same thing over and over again . I don 't care if that 's what it would ' really ' be like , I did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things ! I expect unreasonable things , like aliens , demons , or good acting ! They were stupid , too- Let 's go have intimate relations in a cave ! With all of our clothes on ! Speaking of which , the ending somewhat contradicts what Domingo said immediately before he died . This bugged me a bit , though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a ... serious invasion of one girl 's privacy.No plot , no climax , no good acting , terrible camera-work . What 's left ? Oh , right . The ending may have had a ' twist ' but generally with horror movies , the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film . Sixth Sense does- it explains a lot . Hide and Seek did , too . But the Cavern had a lame twist that served as an ' explanation ' , if you could call it that as it doesn 't . Explain . Anything.Don 't see it . Please . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ya I rented it , so shoot me ! A decent premise sets up an otherwise awkward story with no real payoff , but at least it 's shot well . Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside . In most cases this should be a slam dunk , but this little stinker derails quite quickly . The cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best , but the story and writing is just plain awful . Slower scenes drag on forever and the scares are too few and far in between with no real climax to the film . An eerie mood is set at the beginning but loses it 's luster before any type of horror transpires , and I found myself bored to death and making another sandwich ... The cover art is appealing and I suppose it 's worth a rental if you 're looking for mindless low budget dreck , but if you enjoy a good story and eventful ending , reach for something else . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Gee , what a crappy movie this was ! I cannot understand what people find so scary about " " The Grudge " . " The director plays one trick ( I 'd have to admit a very good one , that is brought to life very stylized ) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again . As a consequence I startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie , but once I knew the drill I practically fell asleep as The Grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute . To conclude , I can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with , that the so-called predecessor " " The Ring " " was way scarier and that buying a ticket for " " The Grudge " " is a waste of money . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched 3 / 4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here . It was fairly easy to watch ( at 3am ) . It had good casting - Kevin Dillon 's role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable - he was both charasmatic and chilling . The rest of the main characters weren 't so bad either.This is your typical stalker / suspense movie . A married couple cannot conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help . A sociopathic " " genetic material " " donor fixates on the recipients and , in typical stalker form , intrudes into their lives.As I said , most of the movie was fairly good .. we see " " Conan " " grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother . Of course things don 't work out for him the way he planned . Not a bad plot line.But , the last 15 minutes were just horrible . I am pretty tolerant with movies ( especially at 3am ! ) .. but , I was just amazed at how bad the ending was written . I actually scoffed outloud ! All in all , not the worst movie I 've seen , but I wouldn 't be able to sit through it again ( unless I skipped the ending ) . The only redeaming quality here was Kevin Dillon 's role - - one of the best serial killers ever.Try looking around at the other channels before watching this .. But , if nothing better is on , I 'd give it a try .. = ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Very rarely do I give less rave reviews on a show or film I dislike on IMDb , but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful , it 's terrible.I wouldn 't have minded if this had been an animated series- would 've been better that way I guess , but as a live-action show , it typifies the terms ' cheesy ' and ' campy ' . Of which Power Rangers is . Five multi- coloured , spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills . The costumes are horrid- they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear . The acting is woeful , and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch , it makes Jean- Claude Van Damme , look as equally as good as Bruce Lee , which is an understatement in itself . In fact , they look as if they are jumping and dancing about ; like it was some version of the ' Nutcracker ' , or they were doing ballet , rather than fighting . Besides , there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun-yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly.Kids show or not , this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity . And even though this version is set in America , you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the US , but rather in Japan ; thus the somewhat ' fake ' fighting and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version-only to be juxtaposed onto the US version.If you like this type of thing , then stick with Sentai- the Japanese equivalent . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Some teen agers go to an old deserted farm house left to one of them by their dead grandfather , unaware that there had been several murders there decades earlier because their grandfather had made a pact with the devil for a good harvest- couldn 't the guy have thought of something better to sell his soul for ? The man 's grandson and his friends are set up to be the next sacrifice , for reasons which are never explained . The stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend , the black guy with a white girlfriend , and the two lesbians have to do battle with three killer scarecrows- but , don 't be tricked like I was , this isn 't nearly as fun as it sounds . It 's mostly just a lot of chit chat about ball kicking , dope smoking , and the lead actor complaining about never knowing his parents . The camera work is atrocious and shaky , maybe done on a hand held camcorder in some scenes , which maybe a good thing since the scarecrows look like they just came from some kid 's birthday party , and apparently they could only hire two people to play the three scarecrows ! Some of the best movies I 've seen have been these low budget , independent horror movies , but this one is just pathetic . The cast and crew seems to have just been made up of a bunch of people who knew each other , had never acted before and had no intention of acting again , and had a few thousand dollars ( I can 't believe this movie cost $ 130.000 to make ) and a weekend of free time on their hands- even the lesbian skinny dipping scene is lame.I think it 's amusing also , that as of this writing , there is a sequel to this film which no one has even bothered adding to IMDb . * out of * * * * , and I only rate it that highly only because of the skinny dipping scene , no matter how lame it may be . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" We arrived at the theater too late to see Rendition , which was our intention , and ' The Comebacks ' was the only film that hadn 't already started . I had an inkling of how bad a film it was after reading the short blurb at the ticket counter . The theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film started.The screenwriters and director threw every imaginable sports clich챕 at the audience without creating a single laugh , not one during the entire movie . Think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or lampooned . If you add Texas to the mix , you ought to come up with the sports version of ' Little Miss Sunshine ' , not a big yawn.The first film that came to mind as we exited the theater was ' Can 't Stop the Music ' By comparison , this was ' Can 't stop the Music ' without Bruce Jenner , Valerie Perrine , or the Village People.If the film had a single grace note , it was seeing Matthew Lawrence grown up . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Without John Rhys-Davies , I have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter . But in spite of that single fact , this is not a bad little thriller , considering the low budget , the low quality effects , the stiff acting and the Sci Fi Channel aspects . The blood effects are very convincing , and the Chupacabra actually looks realistic ... regardless of what you think a Chupacabra looks like this is one good-looking Chupacabra.Aside from the positives , this runs kind of like Kolchak : The Night Stalker ( Darren McGavin , remember ? ) meets the Love Boat , but in spite of the ultimate cheese of this work , it still holds something resembling a plot , and actually attempts to gain your respect while making you laugh and roll your eyes.As conflicted as this work is , I still managed to find some enjoyment herein .

" I can 't figure Al Pacino out . I watch him in the Godfather , Scarface , Carlito 's Way , and I think I am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years . Then I see him in Two for the Money , Any Given Sunday and Revolution , and I wonder what the guy is thinking.I stumbled on Revolution a few nights ago , and thought I would invest the next two hours on this . Here is a news flash : Want to get prisoners to talk ? Force them to watch this over and over ... they 'll confess to anything.I won 't rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot , but it does take place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved , but ultimately does . While he has no money , no education and dresses like a caveman , a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason , since they have only two minutes of dialogue together.Quite frankly , if " " Al Smith " " starred in this movie , instead of " " Al Pacino " , " it would have ruined their career . The script was horrible , but Pacino 's demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse . Donald Sutherland 's role was laughable . I really can 't describe it . Natasha Kinski is a main character , but has like 5 lines in the movie . In fact , nobody speaks much in this movie.One of the most laughable premise in the movie is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield . Its like the entire Northeast is a Starbucks . " " Hey , funny to see you here again , on ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles away ... see you in a few months " .

" I am not kidding : there 's a scene in this movie where a hobo hits his head on a tunnel keystone and explodes ( with no fireball , though ) into a million pieces ! It made some kid in front of me scream in terror ! ... In a G-rated film ! This film might serve to convince children that Santa Clause is EVIL ! His helpers are ugly , misanthropic , over-the-top and mean ! When Santa ( here an anagram of Satan ! ) appears , all 200,000 elves begin singing " " Santa Clause is Coming to Town " " as though it were a Druid war chant . Then , in the reflection of this movie 's " " Rosebud " " object ( a jingle bell that whispers hints of why you can 't hear it ringing : " " doubt .... doubt ... ) ) , old Saint Nick appears , looking like a stoic Donald Sutherland , his face glowing like Moses ' from " " K10C " . " When we hear him speak , his thundering voice sounds less like a jolly old elf , and more like James Earl Jones ' voice slowed-down about 20 % . Frightening ! The syrupy music is out-of-place , boring and repetitive . It doesn 't follow any emotional threads ( as in " " Titanic 's " " very effective score ) . It just seems thrown in at certain points in order to generate feelings of warmth and magic . It fails to stir , partly because it doesn 't match the imagery of the film . There are some musical train wrecks ( no pun intended ) where , out of nowhere , the eerie , symphonic score slams abruptly into happy , child-voiced POLKA about the title locomotive . It just makes the whole movie sound like it was rushed into production ! Finally , I agree with some other reviewers about how , well ... " " dead " " everyone looks . It does seem a little macabre at times . The motion-capture technique is good for allowing the Kings Island-like roller-coaster train sequences to look convincing from a distance , but up close , " " real " " actors should have been used .

" Alan ( Anthony Steffen ) , an English multi-millionaire with a few screws loose ( thanks to his first wife 's infidelity and untimely death during childbirth ) , entices sexy , red-headed women to his castle , offering them bundles of cash to stay the weekend . Once back at his ancestral pile , he gets them nekkid , proceeds to flog them with a bull-whip , and then kills them.But when he meets blonde hottie Gladys ( Marina Malfatti ) and falls for her ample charms , he decides to give up his murderous ways and get married . Their wedded bliss is short-lived , however , thanks to Alan 's iffy mental state , which becomes increasingly fragile when his dead wife Evelyn starts to appear outside his window and a spate of gruesome murders occur within the castle grounds.So let 's recap : a groovy 70s Euro-horror with loads of tasty women in various states of undress ; spooky Gothic retreats and misty graveyards ; a sadistic rich psycho with a penchant for drop-dead gorgeous babes with cracking bods ; several vicious murders ( including a great bit where one victim has her head bashed in with a rock and her entrails eaten by foxes ) . Normally , a checklist like that would guarantee me a good time혰so why did I find ' The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Grave ' so dull ? Well , for starters , the plot is way too convoluted : there are red herrings , crazy plot developments , and suspects galore , and it all becomes a bit too much . By the ridiculous ending혰in which we discover that , all along , several people have been plotting to get their greedy paws on Alan 's wealth , and that our red-head killing nut-job is actually supposed to be the hero of the movie혰my head was hurting too much to care ! Secondly , Emilio Maraglia 's direction is pretty torpid . Stylish , yes ; but as slow as molasses at times.And then there 's the bits that are just too damn silly , possibly even for a giallo : the death by poisonous snake bite ( surely one of the most bizarre choices of weapon ever ) ; Alan 's Aunt Agatha , an old crippled relative who is played by a pretty young woman ; the hiring of a group of identical curly headed blondes as maids ; the poor attempt at convincing the audience that the film is set in England ( mentioning ' pounds ' and hiring a crap police uniform for one of the extras is not enough ) ; and then , of course , there is the unlikelihood of finding a bag of sulphuric acid laying next to a swimming pool ... ' The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Grave ' isn 't a total waste of time ( how could it be , with so much female flesh on show ? ) , but there are much better giallo 's out there . Watch this one if you 're a fan of the genre and you 've already seen the best혰but don 't expect too much . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I see a lot of movies . Saw the original wargames years ago and loved it . Computers where still " " a big mystery " " for the most of us and the movie was convincing , in it 's own way.This one , however , looks like a low budget Wednesday night special . Total crap , from start to finish.The plot is so weak , you won 't believe it until you see the movie ( which I would not recommend in the first place ) . I can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie . But hey , with that script I would 've been surprised if ANYONE could do a good job acting . Lots of clich챕 scenes . CGI looks like it 's taken out of the ' 86 version.Bah , no , I 'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this . Do NOT watch this movie.Life 's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I actually like Asylum movies . I 've made it a habit to see as many as possible . Even the rip-offs they 've done have been cool like EXORCISM And WHEN A KILLER CALLS . This is just plain lame . I can 't believe that the same people who made DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA 'S CURSE actually made this movie too ! ! ! It 's not even laughably bad like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION ( which , by the way are pretty bad ) . This is just BAD ! I mean , I can appreciate and / or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an Asylum movie , but this film takes itself way too seriously . I really hope that SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better .

" I respect Mike Hodges , and liked Get Carter immensely for it 's bleak outlook , but The Croupier just seems like a particularly dull ITV drama.The reserved , cold acting isn 't just the preserve of the lead character , it 's spread to the entire cast , meaning there is nothing to contrast Owen 's character with.None of the characters evoke any kind of feelings at all , except boredom . The ending of the film is also untidy at best . The camera work etc is fairly good , but if you want to see Hodges best watch Get Carter , don 't bother with this uninteresting , unimaginative trawl through emotions he covered better 20 + years ago , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I guess that " " Gunslinger " " wasn 't quite as god-awful as most of the movies that " " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " " shows , but westerns just aren 't Roger Corman 's forte . Portraying Rose Hood ( Beverly Garland ) becoming sheriff in an Old West town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies , the movie is pretty predictable . John Ireland is Rose 's new hubby , secretly working for unctuous Allison Hayes ( yes , the 50-foot woman ) . Also appearing briefly is frequent Corman co-star Dick Miller as a mailman ( Miller nowadays stars in Joe Dante 's movies ) .I do wish to assert that you 'll probably want to watch the " " MST3K " " version to really enjoy this movie . They had a great time with it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" After reading the reviews I am so relieved to know that I am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie ! I am a HUGE Nicholas Sparks fan , have read ALL of his books , most of them more than once . Of course I LOVED The Notebook and A Walk to Remember ... I haven 't yet seen Message in a Bottle or Nights in Rodanthe so I can 't comment on those ... But I did go see Dear John this past weekend and I was terribly upset ! The movie was not good at all ! When looking at the movie alone , and not thinking about the book at all , it was still a terrible movie . I did not get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that I have got from other movies I enjoyed , especially The Notebook . I was not smiling and laughing and crying and worried and scared ... ever ! From the very beginning all I could notice was how they changed everything ! The only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named John who is in the military and a girl named Savannah who is not .... the part about his Dad being obsessed with coins is about the only other part that went along with the book . Everything else was totally off ! ! ! ! First of all , in the book , Allen was Tim 's little brother , NOT his son ! WHY they had to change that , I don 't understand . It made a lot more sense how it went in the book when Tim was just a little bit older than Savannah and they grew up together and Allen was Savannah 's inspiration for wanting to work with horses and autistic children .... that didn 't happen in the movie .... ugh ... And in the book they spent a lot more time together than just those initial 2 weeks and then the 1 night ... why did they leave those times out ? ? ? I could go on and on and on but then I would run out of space ! So basically , if you are a great fan of Nicholas Sparks , don 't waste your time or money on this movie ... just read the book again ... because it 's terrible and nothing like the book ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My girlfriend has the habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies no-one has ever heard anything about . Admittedly , at times , it has led to some fun discoveries . Often times , the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half.She brought home " " Advice From A Caterpillar . " " She was excited because the box said it was funny . Lucky for us , the propaganda on the boxes never lie.This movie was an exercise in patience . This is one of those movies where , unless you are a pretentious and shallow person who likes watching movies about yourself , you will hate every character in the movie . Until the introduction of the one nice character . Which the lead annoying pretentious character will fall in love with and act in such a way that , in the real world , would drive anyone away.MILD SPOILERS FROM HERE ONSo a bunch of emotionally vapid , stuck-up , pretentious artists swear off love and find success in their careers . Then , they meet a nice , intelligent , emotionally mature and loving character ( an almost perfect guy ) . We then watch the woman , the annoyingly pretentious artist ( in her 30 's ? ) freak out as she falls in love . So she tries to flee from the nice , intelligent , emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she 's been having great but empty sex . She is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him away . In the real world , she would have been quite successful . I certainly wanted to flee from her and I wasn 't even in a relationship with her ! Although its nice that the man ' fought for his love ' , I never wanted her to have him . ( Nor did my girlfriend ) She didn 't deserve him . And , why I wonder , did the director think that the ' almost perfect guy ' should be punished by having to win a relationship with her ? When the artist was asking the ' almost perfect guy ' to leave , we were screaming for him to leave too . There 's a problem with a movie when the heroine of the film is so annoying , childish and stupid that you want her to fail.Beyond that , let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance . Regarding the other characters , they were well acted , morally bankrupt and annoying characters.It is a comedy and I can say I did laugh a few times in the film . Unfortunately , not much laughing happened until the last 10 minutes or so . But by the time I had those laughs , I had been praying for the movie to end for far too long . I needed to get these vapid characters out of my life.If you want to watch people you hate struggle with a love for people they don 't deserve , then this is the movie for you . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" An unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as the Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants . At the beginning of the film she " " throws back " " the stableboy for being too young before setting off for the chauffeur ! The high-toned English set she moves in is such a clich챕d bunch of harummpf-ers that it 's ridiculous . But the topper is Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent !

" Well , I only caught the tail end of this film on HBO , just the final 10 minutes or so , but I must say that it contains probably the most laughable depiction of distance running EVER put on film ! I 'm a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan of the sport , and I 've sat through many painful demonstrations in movies before . However , nothing could have ever prepared me for what is shown on screen in the final 10 minutes of this movie , it literally defies belief ! The depiction of the runners is even more ironic considering that African runners completely dominate the sport , and they are elegant and graceful . The female protagonist shuffles along like an overweight pregnant woman , and her " " highly trained " " male supporters are no better . Well into the race this alleged world class runner is surrounded by pudgy , overweight people , many of whom are WALKING ! I find it interesting that the director decided to have her lead the female competition , yet near the end she is shown passing people who look like they 're staggering along on two broken legs ! Are we to believe that this amazing stellar athlete has only overtaken a crippled person at the very end of the race ? Maybe the director just thinks that female runners can 't run faster than 12 minute miles , and he has obviously never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba.Even if you aren 't a running fan you 'll be astonished by the insanely inaccurate portrayal of running , and this movie is only watchable as unintentional comedy . Here is a note to the director : The next time you decide to make a movie about a sport , it might be worth it to hire at least one person who actually has observed that sport in action . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was NOTHING like the book . I think the writer of the screenplay must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to Gone with the Wind and been turned down . This was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway . The only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action . None of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book . For a Gone with the Wind fan ( of both the book and the movie ) this was deeply disappointing . If you loved the book Scarlett , don 't watch this movie hoping to see it played out on the screen . They only share the title in common . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The premise for Circle of Two is an intriguing one . A forbidden love between a sixty year old painter Ashleigh ( Richard Burton ) and a fifteen year old girl Sarah Norton ( Tatum O 'Neill ) ; and the question of whether such a relationship is acceptable given society 's standards . The problem with Circle of Two , however , is that it fails to live up to its promise . Director Jules Dassin and Hedley should have put more thought into the screenplay . When I watched this film , I expected to learn something new about love and sexuality . Instead , I got boring dialogue , a pointless lecture on art , outings where Sarah seemed to have more fun away from Ashleigh , and a closing scene so artificial that its emotional impact was lost . This script makes good actors look bad . So one can imagine how the film 's problems were compounded even further with the largely amateurish cast that Jules Dassin assembled . Tatum O 'Neill was not in her element . I did not believe for a second that her character Sarah was in love with Ashleigh . Her performance seemed superficial , like a contestant at a beauty pageant . It was as though she forced herself to be happy , when the script required her to be happy , and to be sad , when the script asked her to be sad . The only scene I liked with her in was at the very end when she said nothing at all . That was probably the closest Tatum 's Sarah Norton ever came to being real . But Tatum was not the only one at fault . Richard Burton 's Ashleigh lacked the charm , the charisma and the complexity to attract even women of his own age , let alone a fifteen year old . The rest of the cast was also dismal . Even their arguing was unconvincing , because they waited to take turns . Who does that ? Michael Wincott as the jealous ex-boyfriend Paul was probably the best thing in this film , but his role was small . To be fair to the actors , Dassin 's direction let everyone down ; but it is also true that a great movie goes beyond the script . Kubrick 's Lolita did that with James Mason and Sue Lyon ; Konchalovsky 's Runaway Train went beyond the script with Jon Voight and Eric Roberts playing convicts . The directors of these films also knew how to use music to dramatize their films and reveal something about the characters in them . In spite of its own score ( a combination of Antonio Vivaldi , Carl Off and Bernard Hoffer ) , Circle of Two never succeeds in doing that.In conclusion , the idea of a forbidden love story between an elder painter and a teenage girl is a good one , but its execution in Circle of Two is terrible . In many ways , it is a shame that a controversial , Lolita-type story 혯 which most film directors for understandable reasons would prefer to avoid 혯 did not have receive more intelligent treatment ; that a script which actors would have gladly rehearsed was not written ; that actors , who were committed to their part or had the talent to make their characters real , could not be found ; and that the director Jules Dassin ( who did so much better with films like Rififi and Topkapi ) did not have to will to put his foot down and say , " " Before we do any filming , we must rethink the love story and revamp the script . " " The only silver lining is that one day an intelligent film about an elder painter and a teenager girl falling in love may one day be made . If such a film ever appears , this it will be surely spark controversy , debate and questions for many years to come . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sadly , more downs than ups . The plot was pretty decent . I mean , nothing out of the ordinary , but it had a story , unlike the other modern horror flicks . The other good thing was the cast . I 'm not saying that the acting was good , because it wasn 't , but every actor / actress was hot and attractive.One of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so . The rest was quite boring . Another down ( or you could consider it an up if you want ) is the excessive nudity . All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes , and all the guys showed their butts for a long time . It 's not that I 'm against nudity , but this was a horror movie , not ' The Dreamers ' .Unless you 're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes , or watch a girl get naked for no reason , or you 're a die-hard fan of Debbie Rochon , than this is the movie for you . But if you 're looking for a good horror movie , stay away . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Watching " " Speak Easily " " is painful for fans of Buster Keaton . Seeing such a phenomenal writer , actor , comic , director , and stunt man subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a Picasso used as a drop cloth , or perhaps more like seeing the finest Camembert adulterated with whey solids and processed into Cheez-Whiz . Keaton is ill-cast as Professor Post , whose overblown vocabulary is the only thing keeping him from saying , " " Tell me about the rabbits , George . " " ( Post would have said something like , " " Kindly inform me as to the status of the small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha , kind sir , who I believe is primarily addressed with the epithet ' George ' . " " ) When Keaton created his own characters , they might be situationally clueless but they weren 't stupid . They were quick studies and became masters of their worlds . Not so with Post , who never stops stumbling and bumbling and who who has no more control of his destiny than a bilge rat had of the Titanic . And while Keaton 's original characters had a charming naivet챕 and innocence , Post comes across as such a profound sexual retardate that if he ever did become physically aroused , he 'd put an ice bag on the swelling and seek medical help . There are a couple of small , redeeming moments , such as Keaton 's attempts to get rid of the vampish Thema Todd or his suggestion as to appropriate attire for a Greek dance , but it 's just not worth enduring the entire film to see them.If you 're a fan of bad movies , get drunk and watch " " Speak Easily " " with friends , a la " " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " . " But other than that , stick with the silents . Let them be 100 % of what Buster Keaton is remembered for . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I recently was in a stage version of this play . And , on the last day of the run , I was excited to see that it was going to be playing on TV . I stuck a tape in as it was on late at night , and I watched it the next day . I have to say I was very disappointed . The actors in the film made few of the discovers that are in the script . That is understandable as the resersal process is probably different , but it was upsetting to see . A lot of the original script was changed for the movie as well to make it better for the screen , but I am not sure if it helped the movie out at all . I gave this 4 stars only because I know the script and the writing is a lot better than what this movie portrays . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OK , here 's the short of it ... this movie is full of corny dialogue , over the top acting , and a threadbare script.There are moments that intended to be very dramatic but simply come off humorous because of the over the top acting and poorly written lines . I couldn 't help laughing at moments that were meant to be very serious . The bright spot in this movie is the circus . Seeing the circus in its heyday was certainly a treat.There are moments that come through as good . But then it nosedives right back into B-movie territory . I was tempted to stop watching it several times.I certainly don 't know how it won best picture , however . It must have been a slow year ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was recommended to me by some academics . From their comments , I had some pretty lofty expectations . But this movie was nothing but disappointing . The aim of the director is obvious--to use an interweaving of speeches / poems as a way to argue against the Bush doctrine . But the director fails miserably at this . Also I seriously question the director 's choice of main character . It 's a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard . The rise of corporation power , so what ? Most importantly , this movie gets a failing score in its persuasive power ; it 's clearly intended for those who 've already formed their opinions . It 's true that the movie 's aesthetics are quite pleasing . But pretty much everything else in the movie simply sucks . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First of all , since I 'm one of the people who never saw the MST3K chopped up version of this movie , I can 't comment on that.However , I DID see the original version of this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel and I thought it was just as good as anything else on that Channel . In fact , I thought it was one of their better offerings.I 've noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a modicum of intelligence , thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a FEW things about this movie and rightly so . In it 's original cut , most reasonable people I think would probably rate it at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10 . Five is average to me and I think this movie is about average for a Sci Fi pic.In contrast to the above , I 've also noticed that the reviewers who seem immature , dull and flip and as a result come off as boneheads from where I stand , are the same ones who can 't find anything good about this movie and basically trash it without cause based MOSTLY on seeing it chopped up and fricasseed on MST3K . Or if they have seen both cuts it seems they were greatly prejudiced by the MST3K viewing to begin with . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Surrender Cinema has been known for their extremely erotic , almost explicit sci-fi films . While they generally do very well at these ( Femalien 1 & 2 , Virtual Encounters ) , this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape . Any number of girls -- some recognizable and others not -- are in this film in all stages of nudity . There are also several clips from other films which are outstanding , unless you 've seen those other films . There are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things -- some playing basketball , others talking , still others playing with themselves . The only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene -- a short but erotic girl-girl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable Sandy Wasko and a more subdued Tammie Hainum .

" I was excited to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to make a movie in the Cebuano language . ( Not ' dialect ' as most Filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as . As Cebuano and Tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as French and Spanish are to each other . ) But I was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie . Being a Canadian , of Cebuano parents , I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film . I was further excited to hear that it wasn 't another stupid action movie or melodrama as Filipinos love these types of movies . But alas , I was short-changed.Panaghoy serves as an ego trip for Cesar Montano . Montano of course plays the hero of the movie . And when I say ' hero ' I mean in the most stereotypical of manners ; his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the Bol-anons to victory against the Japanese . His character has no depth or complexity . He just fits the hero mold . The rest of the characters are one dimensional ; they all fit their cookie cutter roles.I 'm all for slow-moving / meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving . It didn 't really meditate on anything . Just because a movie is historically-themed , a drama and slow-moving doesn 't make it a well-made film.Particularly annoying is the American actor Philip Anthony . His performance was embarrassing.If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry he should have really thought this through . He said he wanted to make Visayan movies that could compete at Cannes and Toronto etc. but really , this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals . To get Visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences , even if it meant sacrificing quality . Obviously he didn 't think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at Cannes so an audience-attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door.I 'm afraid now that Visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie . If ever I said to a Filipino that I want to see more Visayan movies of course I 'd get an answer like , " " Visayans don 't make good movies . Didn 't you see Panaghoy Sa Suba ? " " Of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a Visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see.An example of movies that are meditative , not just slow moving , are the Tagalog film Blackout or David Lynch 's The Straight Story . I hate to promote the Tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non-Tagalog Filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade I say that Blackout is a VERY good movie . These movies rely heavily on what Hitchcock called ' pure cinema ' . Images without words are used to convey the story . But I bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie. and they do it very well . Panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood.And what 's with so many Filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother ? ? ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I should live this film , but I don 't . It won international awards , it is foreign ( I usually like such films ) it is slow moving ( again something I like ) and it has no gratuitous sex or violence. the problem is that it is boring . We have two friends from the same village in Turkey one " " successful " " the other not. the unsuccessful one comes to Istanbul to stay with the successful in an attempt to get a good job at sea . Both live lives that are unfulfilling , pointless and petty.Well , it isn 't the first time this kind of film has been made . I didn 't see anything new being added to this tired theme . There are long takes that are just someone standing and looking at the sea or sitting in a coffee shop or watching TV . I do understand that this kind of thing is there to show the emptiness of their loves , While it does do that I got the idea in the first 15 min . I don 't need to be beaten over the head with it for the rest of the two hours.The symbolism is also a bit heavy handed. the plate of live minnow type fish with one off the plate and flopping around in its death throws . Symbols are best when they are not obvious but are there , in the background , creating a mood just slightly below the viewer 's awareness.The film is so apathetic , that it doesn 't even rate a score of 1 , so I gave it a 2 . To rate a 1 takes a talent at being bad . This film didn 't have that much energy . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A disappointing end to a season that started so well ... Exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were amongst the best seen on TV in any series , where as this was rather bad.Well I am not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment , but the cheesy guitar music at that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original series.Its almost as if the corporate execs didn 't like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up . They failed and rather spoilt everything.Lets hope this is not a trend for the future.Still at least we saw the return of a certain person even if somewhat bizarrely and tritely done . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the single worst movie I have ever seen . Let me say that again : THIS IS THE SINGLE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.It had all of the ear-marks of a bad movie : continuity errors , bad writing , bad acting , bad production value , bad music . I thought that there were a couple points to horror movies . The first is that it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you . This movie gets and F in this category . The second point is that when a character dies , or something bad happens to them , we are supposed to care . This movie gets an F in this regard as well . The first story , a woman gets mauled by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her . The next story , an OCD guy dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend of his . Oh , and then there is the horrific , nail-biting story of a bad roommate . Come on , could you pick topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house , being anal-retentive , and having a roommate ? Turns out all of these stories where hallucinations , virtual reality induced by a Doctor who in turn uses it himself . Wow , stupid.Let me explain something , I enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are . I couldn 't do that with this one . It was utter pain to sit and watch . Do not under any circumstance watch this movie . You WILL regret it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was so offended by this film that I had to write SOMETHING about it , so please humour me.Its only redeeming virtue , outside of some good acting , is that it doesn 't go on past 107 minutes . Even that length is about 30 minutes too long.Comparisons have been made here to the brilliantly dark ' The Grifters , ' but I can 't see it . They are two different films altogether . The closest ' Swindled ' comes to an existing film is ' The Sting , ' made in 1973 . It borrows ( sorry , STEALS ) liberally from this splendid George Roy Hill ' entertainment , ' which is exactly what is was . I enjoyed it because it didn 't pretend to be anything else.There are so many red herrings in ' Swindled ' that I thought I was in a fish tank . It 's very confusing , but that 's only one of its many problems . The principal one is this : if you make a film where everyone lies to everyone else , where everyone is conning , we have no ' anchor ' to ground us . The inevitable result is a mish-mash of very sloppy seconds from other caper flicks.Just about everyone in this film is conniving and objectionable . Surely a basic Film 101 class would tell us that the audience has to ' care ' for someone . We can 't ' care ' for anyone here : they 're ALL swines . It might have worked as a rakish comedy , but it plays it straight from beginning to end.IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS FILM , READ NO FURTHER . BIG ' SPOILER ' COMING . SORRY , BUT I HAVE TO DO IT.There 's so much fake blood and so many fake killings that it doesn 't strain credulity -- it destroys it . The ending is absolutely ridiculous -- a ' murder ' in a crowded airport that isn 't really a ' murder ' at all ? And the ' murdered ' guy , blood-soaked , simply stands up , brushes himself off , and walks away , fake blood dripping , with the booty ? All while the police and hordes of people are looking on , and no one intercedes ? The director must have a lot of cojones if he thinks we 're supposed to buy into this . Noirish B-movies from the 1940s did better . I 'm a great fan of European flicks , but this confirms that schlock doesn 't always come from Hollywood . As far as ' Swindled ' is concerned , my judgment lies with a famous line from the oft-misspoken producer Samuel Goldwyn , who knew all about schlock : ' Include me out ' . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My brother is in love with this show , let 's get this straight . I completely agree with the people who said it was copying off of Dexter 's Lab and Fairly Odd Parents . I 've never really liked fairly odd parents , I mean , some things did make me laugh , but most of the time it 's downright annoying and not cute at all . This is almost the same way I feel about Johnny Test . Except , NOTHING makes me laugh on that show .

And the gay accent ? What the fudge ! I hate the dog to death and I hope he dies , because that would be better for kids to see than listening and watching the obnoxious crap that goes on in that show , and picking up a gay accent.Unless you want you eyeballs to burn into miraculous flames and your brain fried from this show , don 't watch it ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is juxtaposition of various super bad tough guy biker characters , loosely connected but with no real storyline . Some of the scenes are nicely filmed . If they took the same cast and crew , and made a movie called the Gent who was the coolest character in the film and came up with an interesting and continuous story maybe it could be decent . As it is , prepare for a lame series of tough guy character intros , all of whom do nothing but ride bikes around the desert all day and cause trouble while all staying never getting sunburned and keeping their hair and clothes perfect and never needing to look for a home or money , etc . There was a sort of background story about the characters pasts various people that were killed and a treasure that was probably supposed to be the plot . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
The concept was ok but hardly original . The acting was plastic . But the real spoiler was that there was only one joke and a grubby one at that . This is a film for fourteen year olds who have been let out on their own for the first time . Don 't dare to watch it with your kids . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly . Danny Glover does a good job making you wonder if he 's the bad guy . Meanwhile , the other characters are just part of the story . Dennis Quaid didn 't have as much room in the story as he could have had . I thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded . I 'd watch it again though . I rated it a 5 ( wish I could rate it a 5.5 ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ok so here 's the basic plot . It is 1933 , Peter Sellers is Dr Fu Manchu , a 168 year old Chinese man who has lived quite a long time . The film opens with his birthday in which he celebrates by drinking a special elixir that ( even the film never mentions ) prolongs his life . Well on this occasion the elixir is clumsily dropped by an assistant ( Kato if you remember the Pink Panther movies ) and he orders his minions to then go find 6 rare items to make the elixir . This creates a global man hunt in which his henchmen end up robbing museums of diamonds and venturing into London , to meet up with Dr Fu 's nemisis , a retired Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith , also played by Sellers who tries to stop him in what is suppose to be a witty comedic adventure.This was apparantly Sellers last full length feature film that he made before he died . The terrible tragedy is that he was in it . Sellers who is such a gifted comedian and has had memorable ' funny ' roles in the Panther movies and particualrly in the movie ' The Party ' , is anything BUT that in this film . This film was absolute torture to sit through and I couldn 't even finish it . He completly DIES and I kept cringing while watching Sellers performance . After coming of the great work of ' Being There ' a year earlier how , I mean HOW can he make this and HOW did this thing even get made ? ? ? Like one person mentioned the first 10 .. 15 minutes are ok but then it is ALL DOWNHILL ... Avoid like the plague.Rating 1 out of 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends . Its reputation had preceded it , and though all my friends were also of legal age , I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it . We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend . Though we sat in close proximity to each other , we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other 's presence . As it turned out , the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt . It did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content , but it disappointed in every other way.Caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick . It fails miserably in its ambition , subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds . The film 's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect , and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real , graphic sex . But in setting this sex in the context of Caligula 's depraved reign , it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie . Sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved , but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of Caligula . In it , sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination . In the present day , it is somewhat common to hear words like " " sin " " and " " depravity " " used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives . Caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it.The historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex , they fail to entertain , enlighten , intrigue , or interest the viewer in any way . They only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium . Rarely has a film proved so boring . The sex , after the initial shock and astonishment fades , only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture.Rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence . While many films more violent than Caligula have been made , few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence . Apparenly , unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper-depraved sexuality characterized Caligula 's emperorship . The violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex.A review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells . I understand why someone would want to see this film ; after all , I myself succumbed to the same curiosity . I simply hope that my review , by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value , will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not . My high school criminal justice teacher described police work as " " hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror . " " This statement perfectly describes Caligula . You have been warned . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Extremely dull drama starring a very young Roddy McDowall , who trains a wild horse , the Flicka of the title , and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place . Coated in blaring , overbearing music and weighed down by schmaltzy dialogue , this is one of those interminable films that bores you to the point of a gnawing headache . The naffly-titled sequel , ' Thunderhead , Son of Flicka ' , in which McDowall trains the next generation of nag , is marginally better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to pummel you into submission , although there are at least one or two scenes that don 't induce a coma . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Unfortunately , one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering , silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate , clich챕d screenplay . Hollow Man is a rather useless film.Practically everything seen here has been done to death - the characters , the idea and the action sequences ( especially the lift shaft ! ) - with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects . However , it is just the same special effect done over and over again , and by the end of the film that has been done to death also . I was hoping before watching Hollow Man that the Invisible Man theme , which is hardly original in itself , would be the basis of something newer and more interesting . This is not so . It isn 't long before the film turns into an overly-familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics - the mound of clich챕s piles up so fast that it 's almost impressive.On top of all this , Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best . Good points might be a passable Jerry Goldsmith score ( but no competition for his better efforts ) , a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects . I was tempted to give this film three out of ten , but the effects push Hollow Man 's merit up one notch.4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80 's well with some good performances.However ..... The script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where I expect it was intended to be edgy . The characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clich챕s that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front . The biggest problem is this movie has no real story . It ticks all the right " " arty " " boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was.Very disappointing , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television ... and sorely disappointed at the end result.The only " " amazing " " thing was the wall crawling ( despite the visibility of the cable ) . I didn 't think Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit . You could tell they were two different actors.Granted , I can also spot in the modern Spider-Man movies when I am looking at Tobey Macguire and when I am looking at CGI . But that is from a trained eye and experience working with CGI . Still , the 70 's version could have been better despite lack of Special FX.The webs were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap around things rather than stick to them . And what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in . Hello ? He 's the web slinger people.Sorry ... didn 't mean to get so worked up , but our beloved wall crawler deserved better . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OK - the helicopter shots are fantastic , and the director made good use of some of Barcelona 's top sights . Otherwise ... production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week . Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to watch , Abel Folk had the most depth and was very effective , and William Baldwin was ... well , William Baldwin . He got to put his martial art training to good use and be a running-jumping-earnest action figure . The rest of the cast was wooden at best , but mostly paper . So - if you 're nostalgic about Spain - it 's a picture postcard with an action twist , and a healthy dose of El Greco . If not , skip it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Bigfoot movies tend to be bad , so I 'm not inclined to watch them . However , there were some good commercials on The Sci-Fi Channel , so I decided to watch . A climbing expedition heads into the Pacific northwest to find a a fallen airplane carrying the daughter of the expedition 's leader ( played by Lance Hendrickson ) , and have brought a revolutionary DNA detector that could be used to prove the sasquatch 's existence . And it actually generates some suspense at first . The sasquatch is unseen , but sees the mountain climbers ' body heat ( like the alien in " " Predator " " ) , and I did wonder when it was going to strike . The acting is passable , as is the background music . The dense wooded location is well-used . And when the creature is finally seen , the costume is not bad , though nothing great . But as the film grinds on , it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd . Most of the characters are unpleasant people , rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity ( except for Lance Hendrickson 's character ) , so that it 's impossible to care about what happens to them . And their behavior become increasingly stupid . One man shoots the creature ( not fatally ) , then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark . One female camper puts on a slinky silk negligee before crawling into her sleeping bag , then barely escapes being dragged into the woods by the sasquatch , without getting her hair and make-up messed up . Then , the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is really after the DNA detecting machine and will let them live if they leave it behind ( " " a creature knows what threatens it " " ) . Obviously , the instinct doesn 't apply to these actors , or they wouldn 't have appeared in this movie . And the ending is so stupid , you 'll want to kick the TV screen . If it weren 't for the script , it would have been a decent horror film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" You know the movie could have been a lot better when the animal - in this case , a little dog - is the best actor on the screen ! The acting in this film is so bad , so amateurish , by dog got embarrassed watching this . He ( " " Rusty , " " our Golden Retreiver ) could have done a better job than the people in here.By now this is almost a trite story : kid finds animal , pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the " " pet " " winds up saving one the kids and is now a hero and an official member of the family . Sound familiar ? I remember this movie being a big hit , but never got around to seeing it until the mid ' 90s on VHS . I was shocked how bad it was . Why so much fuss over a film ? Was it because there was so much sleaze in the early ' 70s that a nice family film stood out in the crowd ? Possibly . There wasn 't a whole lot of wholesome entertainment in the decade of the ' 70s plus a lot of people are suckers for cute little animal stories . Who could resist this cute little dog ? Not me . But the movie I can resist : it 's a Grade B storyline with horrible acting . Recommended only for small-dog animal lovers and I mean " " lovers " " because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this film in this day-and-age . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The real surprise of this effortlessly lightweight movie is how such a top notch cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a hammy uninspiring affair . Presumably it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape . One can imagine that by the time Miranda Richardson got contacted by her agent , the conversation went along the lines of : ' Do you want to shoot a movie in Dublin scripted by Neil Jordan ? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already in ! ' This is a dull ' comedy ' that sees Michael Caine and Dylan Moran try and pull off a well-planned hustle where Moran must imitate a London gangland boss ( whose arrival is imminent ) to collect a sizeable sum of cash from local kingpin Michael Gambon . The rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly . Moran is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as Black Books . Caine is unchallenged in his role and gives a steady performance without being overstretched . One can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie - it can 't even have been a summer in Dublin given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background . Gambon actually steals the show , and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of Have I Got News For You will know that he is a wonderfully funny man . But overall the result is disappointing , and it seems a lifetime ago that Neil Jordan was making quality movies of the likes of Mona Lisa . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " True " " story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods .

I don 't mind the concept of a film without words , ( ie : entering a fantasy or dream world ) , but there has to be something there to capture your imagination , not just empty images , which is what this film is . There seemed to be no character development and it jumped so fast from scene to scene that it was hard to discern any story .

" I chuckled a few times during this movie . I laughed out loud during the notarizing of the margarine company handover ( pun intended ) .There are three segments in this movie . The first one is supposed to be a spoof of " " woman ' grows up ' and launches career " " movies . The Tampax짰 box was the funniest thing in this segment . Most of the cast members aren 't listed here on IMDb . They are the lucky ones . Few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers.The second segment is a spoof of " " sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry " " movies . Robert Culp has several funny moments , all physical humor , including the aforementioned handover . After his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as Dominique Corsaire rises higher and higher . By the time she becomes First Lady I wanted to rip the cable out of the TV and watch " " snow . " " I switched to Pakistani music videos instead . I don 't understand Urdu , or whatever language the videos were in . It was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull " " story . " " Then came " " Municipalians " " with the * big * stars , half of them on screen for less than a minute : Elisha Cook , Jr . , Christopher Lloyd , Rhea Perlman , Henny Youngman , Julie Kavner , Richard Widmark and ... * Robby Benson . * It 's supposed to be a spoof of " " young cop teams with hardened , substance abusing older cop who needs retirement * badly * " " movies . The horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive . It was interesting seeing old RTD buses , and a Shell gas station sign , and an American Savings sign -- none of them are around anymore . Nagurski 's " " Never stop anywhere you might have to get out the car " " made me smile momentarily . Then they discuss how boring the young cop is . A lot . Back and forth about how boring he is . That was as boring as this description of how boring it is . Nagurski 's Law Number Four , " " Never go into a music store that 's been cut into with an acetylene torch , " " made me think that the music store is a real business at the actual location the dispatcher gave . Thinking about that was more interesting than the set-up for the gag which followed . Young Falcone ( Benson ) gets shot . A lot . He becomes a hardened cop like Nagurski . The segment keeps going . On and on . And on . It won 't stop . It rolls relentlessly onward no matter how many times you wish he 'd just * die * already so this thing will end . It doesn 't . It goes on and on and on ....

" RUN ... do not walk away from this movie ! ! ! ! ! Aimed at the very young kids , this movie will bore you to tears . If the Gamera trilogy of the 90 's raised the bar , this film just lowered it . It 's slow paced and the monster fighting is good , but seldom seen . This movie had me dry heaving in the cat box . Just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90 's series.SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Here are the top 10 reasons Gamera fans of the 90 's series will HATE this film.10. This movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby Gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult Gamera die.9. You see the adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film . He gets his butt kicked by a few Gyaos and self destructs ? ? ? He looks old and lethargic . Plus he looks nothing like any gamera you 've ever seen . His suit looked cheap and rushed.8. The young Gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a Pokemon . Big-eyed and cute ... it will remind you of the baby Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2 . Gamera is now too cute.7. This movie has the pace of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay . I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along . I 've seen an SUV full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster.6. Like Godzilla : Final Wars , this movie had very little kaiju time on screen . Final Wars had much more , actually , and better fights although short.5. Kids take the title role . The friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970 's and history repeats itself in the 2000 's . The most successful Gamera films abandoned the Sesame Street feel and went to a darker place . Why go back to a failed formula ? This was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue ( thank god ) .4 . Gamera lost his iconic roar . He now sounds like an Elephant with strep throat.3. This movie may produce a new Olympic event ..... Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm 's way . You have to see the ending to understand this point . Where were the parents ? Oh yea .. right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone.2. The special effects were good , but sub-par for a Gamera movie . Legion and Iris had better effects . The best effect was showing the apple sized baby Gamera fly . Not too impressive.1. This movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect . The director was involved in Power Rangers and it shows . It comes off like a cross between ET , Always : Sunset on Third Street and TMNT . Kudos if you know all 3 references.Rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" it 's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays. usually I would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it 's just a big shame. and it 's also big shame if people like h.p. lovecraft get abused by the likes of this . I rented this " " movie " " cuz of the drop " " h.p. lovecraft " " on it. and I 'm a big fan of many of his adaptions , mainly those done by brian yuzna & stuart gordon. this movie has nothing to deliver ! a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old wine-cellar. digi-cam effect " " red light " " over the whole movie. no actors , just some stupid low-grade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing , stiff as wood. and so must be the director . It 's obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere. but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesn 't work. and no gore-effects , just some blood in a river ( you drink = you become demon ) and dropping here and there. oh yeah , the story : thousands of years ago some " " big old " " colonised the world and took humans as slaves. then mankind got independent , so the " " old ones " " tried to destroy them. and now there are some survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. the only possibility to save mankind is to find the NECRONOMICON , that 's where it gets to LOVECRAFT. so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their wine-cellar. unbelievable - the whole thing ! but as it is dubbed ( german title : " " Armee des Jenseits ) and you can find it in most commercial video-stores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that .

" Although I am generally a proponent of the well-made film , I do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries , and more often than not I do enjoy and admire films that successfully " " break the rules . " " And it is quite true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema . But it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point.Pasolini 's work is visually jarring , but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed , and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography . This is true of DECAMERON . Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors , and while many directors have done so with remarkable result , under Pasolini 's direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors . This is also true of DECAMERON . Pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock , offend , or otherwise disconcert the audience . Such elements can often be used with startling effect , but in Pasolini 's hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film . This is also true of DECAMERON.I have been given to understand there are many people who like , even admire Pasolini 's films . Even so , I have never actually met any of them , and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me . Judging him from his works alone , I am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not " " break the rules " " so much by choice as by lack of skill--and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for " " existential boldness , " " thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker . I find his work tedious , unimpressive , and pretentious . And this , too , is true of DECAMERON . It is also , sadly , true of virtually every Pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This movie was awful in the worst way : you just didn 't care . You didn 't care what happened in the plot ; you didn 't care about the characters . Everyone was devoid of heart . I ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because I simply didn 't want to subject my mind to it any more . There is far too much sex in the film .

That much said , it really is pretty dire.Never mind the laughable back-projection or the awful , awful camera-tracking of supposed " " in-flight " " objects , it 's the stunts that the Concorde pulls off that will have you blinking in disbelief at the absurdity . Barrel-rolls , loop-the-loops and violent " " evasive " " maneuvers left me wondering why the Air-Forces of the world didn 't just fly Concordes as their main fighters.So , here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese-fest : 1 . The Concorde is at least as agile as a Phantom 4 jet-fighter.2. You can fire a flare gun at Mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm out.3. If the flare gun fails to discharge , do not drop it , as it may then go off.4. The Concorde can dodge up to two Sidewinder missiles fired at it at once.5. A flare will distract a heat-seeking missile every time.6. Switching off your jet-engines is a sure-fire way of throwing heat-seeking missiles off track if 5 ( above ) fails.7. When performing a crash-landing in the Concorde , it is apparently impossible to jettison your fuel beforehand.8. Concorde pilots are all combat-trained veterans.As you might imagine , this film is not very realistic . The effects are primitive by today 's standards and that , coupled with the nonsense acrobatics the Concorde performs , makes this a movie deserving of little but scorn.Not recommended . Not recommended at all ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow ! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy . If the cheap-looking opening credits don 't tell you you 're in for quite a ride , then the diabolically tragic " " writing " " sure will.A diabetic kid gets tied on to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation onto the baseball team . Then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts offing people . Need I say more ? This movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was edited with iMovie ( note that spooky color inversion ) and actors who apparently weren 't good enough to show up on some late-night Cinemax special . Actually , thats not fair , as the actors didn 't have much room to work around the abysmal script . Parts of this movie really seem like parody , especially when one character picks up his guitar and starts playing the worst song ever conceived by humans , with the worst lip-synching ever performed to go along with it . The " " gore " " here is also a major disappointment . In most B-movies such as this , there is a thick layer of cheap gore FX to make up for what the story and acting lacks . Here , the stuff is so cheap that it 's not even fun . This movie actually makes " " Jack Frost 2 " " look like lots of fun in comparison.If you think this movie is the " " worst one you 've ever seen " " then you probably haven 't gotten deep into the world of straight-to-video B-horror . Regardless , this movie will cause you a great deal of mental anguish , no matter what your background . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete jerk , and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering . Mary Shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever , but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect . What a waste of time . See Gothic instead .

" One of the many silent comedies Stan Laurel featured in before he teamed with Oliver Hardy , ' Mud and Sand ' is a ho-hum hokum . The story is badly disjointed - though this could be because of the modern-day edit - and the humor itself is not at all inventive.Potential plotlines are started and ignored ; for instance , Stan 's promise to make Fillet de Sole pay for what she 's done to him never comes to fruition . Stan 's character doesn 't seem very centered , either , but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed ' Stanley ' of Laurel & Hardy fame , so it might be that I was just expecting to see this shortcoming.I strongly believe that all the silent films should be preserved and viewed , and I 'm glad this one is still available . It 's just not a great film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I really don 't think it 's necessary that I write a review on a movie with a title as derisory as " " Snake Island " , " but even in the abstract confines of its own genre , this hit a new low , so my anger must be known . The only reason why I even bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because I knew it was going to be bad , it was really late at night , I could not sleep , and in the past , really bad movies would drain the energy out of me and make me long for slumber . It became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful , but it condescended below even those expectations.The movie was directed and written by Wayne Crawford , who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the African river , who ends up having to strand his team on a remote island called Snake Island until another boat comes down to pick them up . They hang out , get drunk , and then become subject to the onslaught of poisonous snakes who are on a mission to purge their island of human beings.If your jaw dropped at the last sentence of my second paragraph , don 't bother to reread it , you got it right the first time . Frankly , I prefer my creature features when the creature ( s ) just attack the nonsensically dumb humans out of hunger , not because they have some kind of a mission . These aren 't mutant snakes . They 're not giants like what you see in " " Anaconda . " " They 're just ordinary , everyday African snakes like mambas and vipers혚only they have the brains to form armies , take up causes , work together to trap people , understand our language , and even dance ! Did your draw drop again ? Well , it 's going to drop further . Amount midway through this awful B-movie , about the part where I 'd already given up , the human characters start drinking around a campfire and then all of a sudden , they break down into some kind of an orgy . And while they dance nude and such , the snakes hunting them all of a sudden stop and start jamming along to it . The combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes , some the most roguish creatures on the planet , have formed an alliance against human beings for some oddball reason , proved just too much for my poor brain . And just when I though the filmmakers couldn 't take it to an even lower level , the snakes started to sing.The people in the movie ? Well , let 's just say that never before have I rooted for the creatures to kill everybody off so quickly . I just could not stand it any longer.I really don 't think I need to keep going on ; you get the picture . If there is anything that makes " " Snake Island " " any different from its other rivals , it 's that it does dare to try to be even dumber and that 's not a complimentary achievement . Why혰just why혰I continue to subject myself to these really bad movies , I guess I 'll never really know . But " " Snake Island " " hits a brand new low . It 's a cheap , trashy excuse for a motion picture that makes " " Anaconda , " " a brainless snake movie , look as brilliant and sophisticated and thrilling as Steven Spielberg 's " " Jaws .

The sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film . They should pay YOU to watch it not you pay them .

" I have read several reviews that ask the question , " " Why was this film made " " ? I myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle , only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end , when in actuality it was doing nothing of the sort . So , " " Why was this film made " " ? I think that is a great question for those watching Heftig og begeistret to ask themselves . This reviewer is proud of director Knut Erik Jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope , brotherhood , and inspiration with this all male choir , but I do not think that Jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table . Let me pose this question to you , " " Do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest " " ? My answer is yes , and this is where Jensen failed . Heftig og begeistret was a good documentary , but it was far from great . Jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects . It was great to hear the songs , but over time , those songs seemed dull , overwhelming , and a bit precocious . From the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow , I knew that I was hooked , but as the film developed I lost interest . Why ? Jensen never took us , the audience members , to the next level . He kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film . Was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir ? The world may never know.Again , I would like to state that Jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music , but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created . Jensen gave us the music superbly , but it was the characters , the subjects , that I knew nothing about by the end of the film . In the mix we had a 97 year old man who still had his driver 's license , we had a large man in a tub singing classic American songs , we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth , we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers , and we even had an ex-drug addict that had only been clean for eleven years . Did Jensen develop these interesting stories at all ? Nope , he left them on the table . It was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it ( see the political man who missed his political days ) , but Jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing . To me , the music was defined at the beginning of the film , I wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men . They were all captivating , yet Jensen seemed to ignore them completely.By ignoring the major subjects of this documentary , Jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end . Without giving the ending away , I felt like Jensen was coloring in the lines . Instead of being bold outside the lines , he chose to create no moment of sympathy , emotion , nervousness , or sadness . Jensen took our subjects from point A to point B to point C without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form . I can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in Norway , but for everyone else watching ( i.e. ME ) more was necessarily needed . I wanted to feel for these guys . I wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled , or just find themselves loved in their own city . There was no story , mostly in part to no development of the subjects . When you watch modern documentaries ( oddly , this film was made in 2001 ) , you want it to play out similar to any Hollywood feature film . You want suspense , realism , and drama , alas , with Heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the sort.Overall , I must ask the question again , " " Why was this film made " " ? My final answer Alex , is that Jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of Earth . I think that Jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population . With that said , Jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film , but he did not create a good documentary . When you make a film of this nature , I feel that you must look within the group , examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart . The only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed . Again , I do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty , but I needed more . With documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community , one expects a bit more than what Heftig og begeistret handed to us . I want to see reality and people , not just another song and dance routine ! Grade : * * out of * * * * * , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" There are those who gripe that this is NOT the opera , but then they don 't quibble with the film of CABARET that was not the original show either . All films of musicals / operas are and have to be " " adaptations " " or they don 't work . CABARET took more liberties with the original show than did the film of PORGY AND BESS and yet it kept its original integrity , reworking the material , and is judged an artistic success . The same holds true for PORGY AND BESS- it reworked the opera into a dialogue / song libretto because audiences at the time loved musicals but stayed away from the few echt filmed operas . It would have been economical suicide for Preminger to produce a film of the opera - it would have lost a fortune for the Goldwyn Studios.That said , this is a fine adaptation . The acting is excellent , the Oscar winning scoring of Andre Previn is magnificent , as is the choral singing , and the individual vocal achievements are incredible . Robert McFerrin ( dad of popular musician Bobby McFerrin ) dubbed Porgy and Adele Addison dubbed Bess . While Sammy Davis Jr. sang his own songs in the film , his recording contract would not permit his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album , so Cab Calloway recorded his numbers ( spectacularly ) for that release . Brock Peters ' bass / baritone is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is her own unique self . Diahann Carroll , although a singer of fine note , has the small role of Clara which required a high soprano , so old reliable Marni Nixon dubbed her singing.The Gershwin Estate hates the film and refuses to grant the musical rights , although the dramatic rights are in the public domain . This sort of hate feud held up the video release of CAROUSEL for almost fifteen years ( although in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in litigation ) and is currently preventing both PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE GET YOUR GUN from being released on video.Of all the stage productions given film versions , it is these latter two which are the sole holdouts to video . Only a campaign of letters to the Gershwin Estate in NY might loosen up the reserve . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I saw that this movie was being shown on TV , I was really looking forward to it . I grew up in the 1980 's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era , have seen every 80 's teen and summer camp movie out there . So I couldn 't wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre . What a disappointment ! ! The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over , with hardly any plot and no substance . And the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed-some of these so-called jokes didn 't come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive . The only good things about this film were the wardrobe , music , and acting . It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80 's , and the same goes for the music . And the acting was top-notch throughout : almost all of Hollywood 's best comedians were present . Too bad they didn 't have better material to work with . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The actor , while not only completely wooden and deadpan , could not read his lines with any gusto at all . He was completely out of focus , had difficulty even looking Juliet in the face , and absolutely NO grace with the lines that he was given . Whoever cast him deserves to be punished . Juliet is almost passable , but she gives no depth to her character , and seems to be completely out of touch with the play . Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog . Benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines .

" In its way , Mister Foe ( originally , and more appropriately , titled Hallam Foe 혯 I can 't see addressing its title character as " " mister " " ) , is a tribute to good acting . Both Jamie Bell , as Hallam , a physically attractive voyeur / creep , and Sophia Myles , as Kate , his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance , are convincing . The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life . A young man who spies on the intimate details of people 's lives the way Hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp . And a woman in Kate 's situation would be repulsed and frightened - she would probably call the police.These things are not , however , what happens in the movie . Poor Hallam 's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he 's been having an affair . Hallam , of course , hates his stepmother and lets he know it . She has sex with him . Kate 's some kind of an employment person who places Hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games . She looks like his birth mother . It all ends happily with Hallam " " resolving " " his " " issues " .

" Screenwriter Steve Tesich 's sophomore effort ( following upon the wildly overpraised BREAKING AWAY ) is a compendium of clich챕s , coincidence , and dour melodrama . Perhaps he lived some of this ; if so , I 'm sorry to say he was inexplicably unable to dramatize any of it convincingly.In fairness , he 's not helped much here by Arthur Penn , a talented director who 's done remarkable work in the past ( BONNIE AND CLYDE , LITTLE BIG MAN ) , but fails to inject any energy or verisimilitude into Tesich 's narrative . The cast struggles as best they can but are saddled with weak motivation and dialogue .

" " " Putney Swope " " is a unique , low low low budget gem from the late 1960 's which probably would have been forgotten in time if it hadn 't been for two things : Paul Thomas Anderson ( who named Don Cheadle 's character in " " Boogie Nights " , " Buck Swope , after the eponymous hero of this film ) and the limited DVD release . Watching " " Putney Swope " " is like listening to hardcore punk rock : it may not make a lot of sense ( at least to me it didn 't upon watching it for the first time ) , but you have to respect the film for its passion and unabashedly rebellious message . I didn 't understand a lot of things about " " Putney Swope " , " but for the most part , I liked it . The more I think about the movie , the more it grows on me.The film is advertised as a parody of New York 's Madison Avenue , best known in the 1960 's as the advertising capital of the world . Members of Generation X and Y may be lost on this concept , but fortunately " " Mad Men " " is on TV to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of U.S. History . What you need to know before watching this movie is that these ad agencies were largely male , and even more largely white establishments.With this premise in mind , the movie opens up with an ad agency board meeting . The members are predominantly white except for Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson , who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dick Gregory in this film ) , the token African-American on the board . The board members are so self-absorbed and soulless that when their chairman falls dead in front of them , their only concern is who will become chairman next . Without even removing the body from the boardroom , they begin a paper ballot to elect the next chairman.Putney Swope is elected by a landslide , but not because the other members think Swope is qualified . Voting for Swope was an ill-fated attempt for these board members to sabotage any other member 's chance of being elected chairman . With their plans backfired , Swope takes charge and " " sink ( s ) the boat " , " firing all but one of the original members and hiring all people of color in their place .After this point , the film became ( for me ) very weird and hard to follow plot-wise . There may not have even been a plot , really . The whole idea of the film seems to be a " " what if " " scenario , with the result being that the new " " Truth and Soul Inc . " " firm would be unconventional , but successful nonetheless . The firm ends up making so much money that the members build a huge glass case to keep the cash in for unexplained purposes . It could be because Swope doesn 't trust banks , although that point is not touched upon or explained in the film . It could also be metaphoric in some way , but who knows.Most of the movie takes place inside the ad agency , with occasional scenes in the White House with a president who , for some unknown reason , is a midget . My assumption is here that some political joke was being made , but I can 't figure out what . Were the filmmakers saying that the president is a small , insignificant part of American life ? Were they saying that the latest elected officials ( Nixon at the time ) were insignificant candidates ? I don 't know . I found it a bit eerie , however , that the man playing the president bore a striking resemblance to future president Ronald Reagan . It is funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie was made.What this film may have benefited from is showing how consumers outside the ad agency reacted to the new ads . Of course , the ad footage possessed a strange , funny appeal for its unconventional creativity , but did these ads convince people to buy the product ? If so , how ? The movie hinted on the idea that the new ad campaign was successful through client interaction and the calls from the White House . However , it would have been revealing to see average people , since that demographic has always been most profitable for advertisers.Although the parodies and political messages this film may have made probably didn 't stand the test of time , this film still had a lot of unique qualities . Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor to him that benefited him greatly in this film . Swope 's rough voice was actually director Robert Downey , Sr. ' s voice dubbed in , sometimes poorly , but fit the character so well in being an authoritative outsider . He hires and fires workers at random , but earns the respect of all but one of the employees for revolutionizing the ad agency and seeking out new ideas.The premise of the film was , and still is , incredibly risky , especially since the film was written and directed by a white man ( Robert Downey , Sr. ) . However , this film declines to fall victim to negative black stereotypes which would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later . Although some of the sex scenes may be a bit off-putting for some viewers , the main message is that a black owned and operated business can thrive through innovation and risk taking . Many people may not take a positive message away from this movie , but I just did . " " Putney Swope " " remains an overlooked movie from a strange era , and Downey , Sr. ( even despite his son 's recent comeback ) never quite got the recognition as a director he deserved . However , if you find a DVD of this movie , buy it and watch it . If it 's on Netflix , ditto . It 's a movie that can be confusing at times , but is worth watching for its gusto , ambition , and its non-conformist stature even by today 's movie standards . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow ! I remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s . They usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students . As I watched this film I felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s . However , then I find out that this film was made in 1989 ? Say what ! Well , the nostalgia factor ends right there , this is just bad . The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools . Which is odd , in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant . In fact , the main character lives in a mansion . Makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive , have they never heard of property taxes . Oh , but here is the kicker . The school board says that they will keep the school alive , if the students can raise $ 200,000 . So the seniors go about doing this . Hmmm , you raise $ 200,000 but instead of saving that for college , you put it towards saving the high school that you are a Senior in ? And why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out ? And ... ahh forget it , this film was stupid and made in 1989 ! ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Do you hear that sound ? That 's the sound of H.G. Wells rolling over in his grave , between this version and Spielberg 's cinematic abortion it 's been a tough year for the classic novel .

The ships and the aliens were all wrong , you don 't really get to see the aliens until the end . The effects and the cast work fine . But these actors are much better then this " " movie " " deserves . The bulk if not all the movie is the Howell character wondering through the devastation , meeting one person , they join him and he looses them for one reason or the other . There 's not more then two people on camera at any given moment though most of the movie . It 's like if they filmed three at once it would put the movie over budget or something .

" Total disgrace ! Truly awful ! The screenplay and dialogue is a joke , and combined with a director who doesn 't have a clue about life in Saudi Arabia . It 's not a surprise , quite Saudi film ha , the director is Palestinian-Canadian , the writer is Lebanese , the lead actress is Jordanian , and the shooting took place in Dubai , and all those elements show very well to make the film far from representing the Saudi society . Yes it contains some Saudi clich챕 's , the stuff we see in cartoons in the newspapers everyday , but that 's about everything . The film had the opportunity to show real problem with Saudi society , or at least give us something new and genuine about the youth troubles and concerns in Saudi Arabia , instead it copied and pasted from here and there , and the result was a mess . Even the supposedly love story in the movie doesn 't exist or at least we haven 't seen it . The only bright side in this total debacle is some good acting from the supporting cast . The veteran Khaled Sami was funny in a badly written role as the grand father , which he is clearly got miscasted , for he looks younger than the actor who plays his son . Also the actor who plays the fanatic brother 's role , Turki Al-Yusuf , has done well , in fact he was the best actor in the film . The rest of the cast , being professionals for long , did an OK job , but the lead actor Hisham Abdulrahman was just bad . He had one look of a little adorable bobby for all situations . He couldn 't even say his lines in a proper manner . He has charisma that made him win the title of Star Academy , a very famous reality show , and he is good in interviews and TV shows , but he was just the weakest link of this film . The lead actress I didn 't mind very much , but even she acted badly in some scenes and overplayed her sensuality in unneeded way.The Film was a huge hit , Saudi flocked in thousands to neighboring Bahrain and Dubai to attend it when it was screened there , and it made a tone of money , then it was screened in pay per view , then in broadcasting TV , and that was in a span of a few weeks . This was to cash on Saudis eagerness to homegrown entertainment , but alas ; the film was neither homegrown , nor entertaining . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE ( 1940 ) is the ninth ( 9th ) film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into . Characters ANDY HARDY ( Mickey Rooney ) and JUDGE HARDY ( Lewis Stone ) were going to be front and center . The rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks . The series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in.Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic manner . The rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do . Mickey Rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve . ANDYs ' reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way . Even after he returned as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY ( 1946 ) his reaction to any ' teapot tempest ' was the same , juvenile.In this film it is clearly illustrated . ANDY gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved . This screen writing device was known as the ' idiot plot ' . A means of stretching a poorly written scenario . Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys ' fault then the Director and the Writers . Most likely George B. Seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control Rooneys ' excesses .

" Alexandra Ripley wrote a horrible sequel to Margaret Mitchell 's masterpiece book published in the 1930 's . Margaret Mitchell 's heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed Alexandra Ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than Barbara Cortland romance novels . I was a huge fan of Margaret Mitchells book and the fake sequel by Alexandra Ripley was written just to cash in for money.Although I always admired the acting talent of Joanne Kilmer and Timothy Dalton , this is a really terrible film . The script is horrible and full of clich챕s . Ann Margarets cameo as Belle Watling is so awful I wanted to slap her.The only worthwhile thing in the movie is Sean Bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy , feral villain - Lord Fenton . Sean Bean 's performance is along the lines of " " The Man You Love to Hate " " and portrays an unsafe sex symbol.But Sean Bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufferably boring script.Don 't waste your money on this film , unless you are a hard core Sean Bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is bad as we all knew it would be . Most times i usually love the bad 80s / early 90s trash-can comedy ( haha no pun intended ) . I list Ski School , Career opportunities , Hot Shots , Summer School and many more made around this time . This even has the classic yet forgotten comedy of Dean Cameron ( aka .. ski School section 8 instructor and Party Maniac for Summer School ) . But this movie is just to slow . It takes almost 30 min to get going and we have to sit through pointless dialog between to half-wits the Sheen boys ( E & C ) . And yes i can hear the bloggers dieing to trash me with " " obviously you don 't watch 2 and 1 / 2 men ) . Well Charlie was not at the level he is now during this flick ... not that he 's anything worth watching now . Charlie only shines when his co-stars support him and Emilio isn 't anymore than an overused wonder bra offering little support . Actually , this movie was written by Emilio and it shows . It has no real ending ( come on Emilio , even the Ski School 2 writers barfed out an ending ) . No idea how any issue brought is solved , no hot babes , no swearing to lighten the bad plot , characters , acting ... I 'm now tired of this tirade .

" I didn 't know much about this movie before I watched it , but I heard it had something to do with quantum physics so I was interested . What I didn 't know is that this is NOT ACTUALLY A STORY but a bunch of New-Age blowhards who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics . I say it belongs more in the Documentary category than Comedy or Drama.Marlee Matlin is in the movie , in order to give this New Age symposium * some * sort of a storyline . Her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the speaker 's thoughts so we won 't die of boredom . Matlin has a real job as a photographer , unlike the New Age hippie that crashes on her couch . We get to listen to nameless people ramble on about what quantum physics all " " means " " to them . The one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from India ( I assume ) , but I think he showed up for the wrong film.It looks like Barbara Eden really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy New Age beliefs . It looks like Quark from DS9 was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film . There is a lot of whizbang CGI we 're supposed to be impressed with ; cells in the body are shown as dancing jello molds , because the filmmakers have apparently seen Flubber one too many times.People in the movie say that the Arawak people on San Salvador thought Columbus 's ship the Pinta was invisible because natives had never seen clipper ships before , as if people today had any way possible way of knowing . Of course they leave out all of that information and just say " " Columbus 's ships were invisible to the Indians in America . " " The film takes many such arrogant leaps . Thomas Young did a double-slit experiment around 1805 and found that light can look like a particle some of the time , and a wave some of the time . Of course you 'd never * know * this from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that " " atoms can be particles and waves . " " And that must mean that people can pass through walls , walk on water , and never grow old if they just wish upon a star ! ! Then I 'm sure Marlee Matlin could stop being deaf if she just * believed * hard enough . I 'm being sarcastic , but this film is chock-full of false hope and beliefs that the people espousing them don 't really hold.These are New Age kooks who have grabbed onto Quantum Theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation , zero point energy , crystal healing , etc . If these snake-oil salesmen truly believed the crap they were selling , couldn 't they just * wish * their paychecks into existence instead of appearing in this joke of a film ? We get to listen to another nameless man , with no credentials that we know of , talk on his couch in front of a fireplace ( or TV screen ) about how he creates his own life . Every time he was on the screen I wanted someone to rush in and throw a pie in his face . These people take themselves WAY too seriously . Some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody ever * really * touches anything because there 's a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level . If only someone had walked onto the screen and kept punching him in the stomach , screaming " " I 'm not touching you ! I 'm not touching you ! " " A moral relativist in the movie claims that there 's really " " no such thing as good or bad . " " So apparently it 's OK that Hitler gassed millions of Jews to death ? Another person says that there is " " no such thing as love . " " It 's just a chemical and that we really don 't love people , we 're just addicted to the chemical rush we have when we 're around them . I suspect this guy is doing this film as community service for being addicted to heroin for so many years.We are witness to a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults walk around a wedding reception , seeing everything like RoboCop . They evaluate if women are cows , dogs , or foxes , and a sexual position pops onto the scree . Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding she 's supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because she 's a beautiful and unique snowflake.I liked when the film said people often find evidence for their pre-conceived notions . Perhaps in this review I 'm only seeing what I want to see , but I TRULY wanted to see these people get pies to the face , and it never happened.If you 've never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before , you may find them interesting , but there are better sources for all of the ideas here . If you want to watch a good movie that talks about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , go see The Man Who Wasn 't There . If you want to read a good book about Quantum Field Theory , read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku . If you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals , see Waking Life ( although it can feel boring , self-important , and pretentious at times ) . All in all , you should go and read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson instead of wasting your time on this movie.I normally have a very hard time giving movies a score from 1 to 10 , but this one was a very easy for me : 1 / 10 Stars.The movie 's title is true . The people in this film don 't know # $ * ! Hands down , the worst movie I 've ever seen . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Poorly done political actioner . Badly photographed , acted , and directed . Every single scene is underlighted , including those very few that are shot during the daytime . It doesn 't matter what the location is . At an important conference in the White House , no lights are on , and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is filtered through a few windows . The primier of China conducts an earth-shattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should be contemplating a bust of Homer in a Rembrandt painting . Honest . It 's as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness . The slow motion deaths are by now obligatory in any ill-thought-out movie.Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo do well by their roles , but Scheider is rarely on screen . The other performances are dismissable . There is a pretty Oriental woman in a short tight skirt who totes a gun and is right out of a Bond movie who 's accent suggests a childhood spent in Basset , Nebraska , and who should have remained the model she probably started out as . Whoever plays the surviving Secret Service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably picked for the part because he looked most like Johnny Depp , not because of any display of talent . The Chinese villains , representing both Taiwan and mainland China , hiss and grin as they threaten the heroes . The script is pretty awful , recycled from other , better films . There is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and practically everyone winds up mincemeat . Two thirds of the way through , the ship explodes into the expected series of fireballs . Then the movie splits into two related parts . Part one , another shootout , this time in a waterfront warehouse . Part two , an exchange between the Vice President , now acting president , and the oily Chinese premiere , lifted out of both " " Dr. Strangelove " " and " " Fail Safe . " " We unwittingly launch our missiles . They launch theirs in retaliation . We cannot convince them that our launch was accidental , even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles .

" This really is a film of two halves . The first detailing the lives and friendship of two boys ( one a privileged Pashtun and the other a down-trodden Hazara ) in late 70s Afghanistan before the invasion by the USSR works extremely well . The young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing Afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark relief.The real problem comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the Pashtun as a man living in America . Ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things break down . The central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic , but in fact comes across as wimpish and wallowing in self pity . It is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see - that of his boyhood friend.Once he returns to Afghanistan the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly contrived coincidences . Most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately ( even though he is not looking for him ) , despite the chaos that has since consumed the country . This enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible . The resolution of the narrative is also run through with an awful , mawkish sentimentality which undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to make.Although it is possible to start seeing characters and the abuses of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which engages with any wider political discussion . Instead the narrative becomes reduced to one character 's emotional journey of self discovery and healing . Unfortunately this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story , while opportunities to make a really interesting film about Afghanistan itself are wasted . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" In Christian Duguay 's movie , Hitler : The Rise of Evil , Hitler 's early years in life and politics is shown in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration . It is quite natural for a Hollywood movie to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the income that they will get from the movie . Even though such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done by the book , I believe that most of them fits well with the rest of the movie , making it more interesting . We should not forget that this movie is not a documentary . Who cares how did his dog died anyway.Throughout the movie , Hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals . But he was not portrayed as a super-villain but more like an ambitious politician . I believe that this is a nice perspective as the movie is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and this made the movie somewhat objective . Yes he was a little mad , and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in " " Inglorious Bastards " . " I believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts.The flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators . Even though the movie 's focus was around Hitler we also had chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions via newspapers , discussions of people and the songs in a Jewish cabaret . Also society 's reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited . Struggles of journalist Fritz Gerlich and ironic plays that are played in the cabaret was amusing and interesting but that was all . Mostly we only saw his followers rampaging the streets and cheering him.Another thing that was missing in the movie is information about the origins of his hatred for Jews . In the beginning of the movie , some ideas about this is given but they were quite superficial . All of a sudden he was a politician who is giving speeches about necessity of extermination of Jews.In conclusion , Hitler : The Rise of Evil cannot be considered as an excellent movie that everyone will like but it is not unsatisfactory at all . If you can stand directors that change history for cash , it is an interesting movie reflecting Hitler 's personality in a successful way . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ugh . Pretty awful.Linnea Quigley gets top billing , but her character doesn 't have a big part . Who is her character supposed to be anyway , the little boy 's aunt ? Another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene . While there was a shower scene in the movie , it was a head and shoulders shot . Perhaps there are some alternate versions of this movie.Quigley does have a bigger part than John Carradine , Cameron Mitchell , and Brinke Stevens , though . Carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog . No other characters are in the scene with him , though he 's sort of composited in , or else there are over-the-shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else . There 's also a really bad photo of him in a cameo locket ( it looks like a bad photocopy ) , and a decent picture of him in a family bible . He conjured up Jack-O originally , or something like that.Cameron Mitchell briefly shows up on a TV as a TV horror host . Brinke Stevens is in the movie he 's showing " " The Coven , " " in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe . Evidently there 's more of the Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD double feature Mark of the Witch / The Brides Wore Blood.Jack-O : what 's it about ? Darn if I know . A little boy is told a story about a pumpkin-headed demon killer , and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason . She follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for Halloween ( put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes , etc . ) . The pumpkin-headed killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people , or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while . Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things , and actually kills people.There are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family , with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too : ancestors of his , I think . I think they figure into Jack-O 's backstory , but I 'm not sure how.The little boy is ostensibly the main character , but we don 't really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses , has nightmares , and will fight bullies even if he 'll get beat up in the process . More time should have been spent establishing his character . I couldn 't have cared less if he died.Not recommended , not even for Halloween . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Perhaps I 'm out of date or just don 't know what Electra is like in current publications ... But the Electra that I read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan . She usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved . Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way.This movie was fairly weak on the dialog , the acting wasn 't particularly convincing , and the action was spotty . I was really looking for something more along the lines of Frank Miller 's book " " Electra Assassin . " " Which is much darker than anything in this movie.Special effect where cool , action was interesting at times , but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical . Tha Hand was not menacing enough , and Electra was not ..... bitchy enough . She 's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story , I just didn 't care either way . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

All I can say is , this director is no ' auteur ' . You never once get inside the game , the character 's head , the amazing talent with numbers the real Stuey had . The coke scene is bad enough to throw your shoe at the set , it might have been a great scene had it been shot for movies and not the stage , with the camera half way across the house hovering over a mirror with drugs on it while the drama is going on far in the background .

" I saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go . This movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next.The 4th Man is about an alcoholic writer named Reve , who has visions of his in-pending danger . He meets up with a woman named Christine when giving a lecture at a local book club , and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is . To put it plainer , Reve likes the Dutch sausage . So Reve concocts a plan to seduce Christine 's boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him . But its later discovered that Christine has had 3 previous husbands , who she all murdered . Now Reve and Christine 's boyfriend could be " " THE 4TH MAN . " " The storyline makes sense with no plot holes . The editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine . The movie is just gross and I felt the need to vomit in some parts . Basically , this isn 't my cup of tea.The movie opens with Reve getting out of bed in JUST a t-shirt . So in the very beginning , you get to see Reve 's lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state . Later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors , and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues . Reve fondles a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum . Plus there 's a lot of blood . More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies combined.Not that I have anything against " " shocking " " scenes , but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking .

" SAPS AT SEA Aspect ratio : 1.37 : 1Sound format : Mono ( Black and white ) Suffering from ' hornophobia ' , Ollie embarks on a ' restful ' boat trip , but he and Stan get mixed up with an escaped convict ( Rychard Cramer ) . Chaos ensues.This feature length comedy - an OK entry which nonetheless unspools like a mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy 's best work - marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach . Episodic in structure , the movie culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after The Boys are taken hostage by villainous Cramer ( who shoots a seagull to prove how tough he is ! ) . The gags are OK , but inspiration is lacking , perhaps due to the recruitment of actor-turned-director Gordon Douglas , previously responsible for Ollie 's first solo effort in the sound era ( ZENOBIA , produced in 1939 ) , but whose work here lacks a measure of pzazz . Fair , but nothing special . L & H regulars Charlie Hall and James Finlayson make guest appearances . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow ... I suspected this one to be bad ... But now I find myself just at a loss for words ... Honestly , no words of mine can do this movie any justice ... I 'll try to say something anyway ... This truly is one unique gem . One of the worst kind.Lash La Rue - given his background as an actor - doing a whip-fight with a Toltec sorcerer-zombie during the movie 's climax ... ? ? ? A true stroke of genius , without a doubt.It rarely happens that I laugh out loud when watching a movie alone . It happened numerous times with this one.The accents of the actors , man , the accents ... And the dialogues I heard them speak ... And the acting itself ... I just couldn 't believe what I was hearing.That fat uncle farting so loudly ( when walking up to the house together with his little nephew ) for no apparent reason whatsoever ... Tits ! Yes , there 's titties ! And female ass ! There 's even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beer ... That one " " stretch his mouth over his face " " -kill was the bomb ! A true highlight.The comedy-aspects were just totally bonkers . I just couldn 't believe what I was seeing and hearing . For a while I even thought that they were unintentional , shaking my head in disbelief . But about halfway in the movie , I started to get the bigger picture . Guess it took me half a movie to dumb-down half of my brain , to finally get it.I had a really hard time believing this movie ... But it 's good , really , I think . It had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard , opening it and then saying " " Wooow , look at all the storage space ! " . " And she said it like she meant it . I mean , that 's good dialogue and good acting , right ? Oh , and perhaps needless to say : Lash La Rue 's whip-skills suck major ass in THE DARK POWER . It 's really sad and pathetic to behold . That 's all part of the comedy , of course . Or wait , I might be wrong . No , yes , I 'm wrong . Lash La Rue was amazing with the whip ! It was the editor 's fault . He messed it up , cutting his lashes together and all . Or wait , it might have been the camera operator . He filmed from the wrong angles ... Then why didn 't Phil Smoot say anything ? That 's it , it 's the director 's fault.But it 's a good movie.I 'm just gonna quit talking about it . I have nothing meaningful to say anyway , except for the fact that I hope my brain will recover from this experience ... some time soon . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I caught this film -- under the title of " " What Lies Above " " -- on Lifetime movie network last night , and just had to comment on it . Designed as a resourceful-woman-in-peril , action adventure yarn , it is so unintentionally funny ( thanks in large part to Marc Singer 's scenery-chewing hammy performance ) that I thought I was watching a cross between " " Cliffhanger " " and " " Home Alone 5 . " " Heroine Nicole Eggert makes her devious but dumb as dirt male pursuers look like the Three Stooges succumbing to her ridiculous makeshift booby traps ( somehow she manages to devise a swinging battering ram with rope and a log in a matter of minutes , which temporarily takes out one of the knuckleheads who want to kill her ) .

" I was raised watching the original Batman Animated Series , and am an avid Batman graphic novel collector . With a comic book hero as iconic as Batman , there are certain traits that cannot be changed . Creative liberties are all well and good , but when it completely changes the character , then it is too far . I purchased one of the seasons of " " The Batman " " in the hopes that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the creators ' reasoning for making this show such an atrocity . In an interview on the making of " " The Batman , " " one of the artists or writers ( I 'm unsure which ) said that " " We felt we shouldn 't mess with Batman , but we could mess with the villains . " " So , they proceeded to make the Joker into an immature little kid begging for attention , the Penguin into some anime knockoff , Mr. Freeze into a super-powered jewel thief , Poison Ivy into a teenage hippie , and countless other shameful acts which are making Bob Kane roll over in his grave . To sum it all up : I wish I had more hands so I could give this show FOUR THUMBS DOWN . It squeezes by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the Batman name . Warner Bros ... rethink this ! Please ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie , heres your chance , and then get back to the real world.The guy who hid the gold in the first movie told Twitch , so he gets transferred to another prison , where wrestling champs hang around looking broody .

But the wrestler 's daughter is caught up in it all , so he and twitch go to find her and Twitch 's woman.As you can imagine , the acting is below par , it features a lot of ( really annoying ) rap music , and poorly edited fight scenes .

" I was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget movie . The most glaring absurdity was that while the American inmates in a North Korean POW camp are all supposedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine , going without bathing , shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas , and sleeping on bare floors , and - let 's not forget enduring torture - they always manage to sport impeccably coiffed hair . With the exception of a suitably austere-looking Harry Morgan as an army Major , the casting and acting are simply awful . Ronald Regan cannot seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles . A mostly Caucasian cast portraying the North Korean camp officers might have been forgivable , but when supposedly Russian officers acting as advisors to the Koreans strut around wearing re-badged Nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots ( obvious costume-department recycles from WWII flicks ) and speaking with accents like General Burkhalter from Hogan 's Heroes , well , that 's just six kinds of silly .

" Warning : This may contain SPOILERS ! ! First of all I watch a lot Lifetime movies and realize they are just that .... Lifetime movies . Some are great ( really ) , some are good and some are bad .

It actually started out with some potential .... single , divorced hard working mom ( who gets out of work at 2 : 00 AM ) cuts a guy off while driving home from work and let 's just say he doesn 't take it too well . The stalking begins immediately with phone call hang ups and escalates to her home being broken into and completely trashed . So she goes to her mother 's for the night and the next morning her mother 's car blows up .

She goes off to work leaving the kid all alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a PIZZA ! ! ! I couldn 't believe it ! Then it really gets stupid !

" Visually beautiful with some fine music , this film otherwise has a fairly trite made-for-TV quality . The romance between two characters , which spans a cultural and educational divide , is simply NOT plausible . Of course , from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up , win over the locals , and find true love , but that doesn 't make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns . This film had lots of promise , which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized . Perhaps a nice under-the-blanket on a cold night freebie on cable , but I certainly wouldn 't recommend paid rental or purchase .

" Dear Mr. Seitzman , Or Whomever I May Hold Responsible For Mr. Seitzman Not Meeting His Rightful Fate Of Being Eaten Alive by Rabid Wolverines ; I do not know you , and so cannot comment on your character ; for all I know , you give to charities and help little old ladies cross the street . Still , I must insist , for the common good , that you never write another screenplay as long as you live . Put down the pen , step away from the laptop ! If you refuse to heed the pleading of wounded brains , I have watched a movie or two in my life , and I believe you will find my counsel helpful : 1 . Do not include love scenes in which overwrought teenage boys name the body parts of their girlfriends after US states . If you must pen such a scene , please do not name the breasts " " New York " " and " " New Jersey " " ; it causes unnecessary speculation as to which cities occupy the nipples . Also , it is almost incomprehensibly stupid and annoying.2. Do not rely solely on John Hughes movies in order to reinforce class distinctions.3. Do not bludgeon the audience over the head with exhausted clich챕s . Yes , yes , Kelley and Sam stand out in the rain , and it cleanses them of their cares . We get it . Yes , the roses continue to bloom in Kelley 's dead mother 's greenhouse , even though every other plant has begun to rot . It Is A Symbol Of Their Love . It is also very painful when applied via blunt-force trauma to the backs of our heads . For the love of God , Mr. Seitzman , we get it . We all get it , all across the land . Amish people , the hard of hearing , unborn babies - we all get it.4. Do not require the actors to perform mime sequences . Ever . No , never.5. Did I mention that you should ease up on the trite symbolism ? Because the audience can draw the parallel between the rebuilding of the restaurant and the building of the relationship between Kelley and Sam without any help . Truly . We get it.6.

" Before I start , I need to inform you that I love horror films with a passion . LOVE THEM ! I have seen thousands and rarely does one come along that I do not like . I am very forgiving of the horror genre . One of the greatest lines in movie history is in the film " " Ed Wood " " where Ed Wood ( Johnny Depp ) freaks out and yells at the overly critical producers after they comment on " " Plan 9 's " " cheap sets and continuity problems , " " You don 't know anything ! Haven 't you ever heard of ' suspension of disbelief ? ! ' " " Well , I try to bring that " " suspension of disbelief " " philosophy with me to every horror film I see and it usually works . Unfortunately , it didn 't work for me during the screening of Cheerleader Massacre.Strike One : The first thing you 'll notice about this " " film " " is that it is shot on video and has that crummy hand-held-home-digital-camera style . The camera work and quality are so bad it makes daytime soaps look breathtaking in comparison . In fact , it makes Troma and Full Moon video releases look good . And , that 's bad.Strike Two : Jim Wynorski . This " " filmmaker " " probably fancies himself a chip off the ol ' Corman , but nothing could be further from the truth . Roger Corman shot fast , furious and under budget , but was able to deliver a tight original film . Though Wynorski delivers a cheap film , he cheats his viewers ( and perhaps other artists ) as he steals entire pieces of James Horner 's " " Humanoids From The Deep " " and " " Battle Beyond The Stars " " musical scores and inappropriately drops them into Cheerleader Massacre . On the back of the box art and during the beginning credits the music score is falsely attributed to , Dan Savio ( an extra in Wynorski 's " " Deathstalker II " " ) . You will also notice how Cheerleader Massacre jumps from video to film and back again as Wynorski lifts entire scenes from both " " Slumber Party Massacre " " and " " Humanoids From the Deep . " " Wynorski utilized this deception , fourteen years earlier , in his horrible version of " " Not of This Earth . " " Strike Three ( you 're out ) : While Cheerleader Massacre does have some nudity , ( 40-year-olds playing teenagers and the grossest set of fake breasts that I have ever seen in a horror film , ugh ) , the murders are relatively bloodless . What the heck is that all about ? The film is titled , Cheerleader Massacre , but a handful of off-screen killings , in my opinion , does not add up to a massacre . It doesn 't even add up to a bad mosquito bite.The " " film 's " " story is fair enough - unseen killer stalks a vanload of cheerleaders ( old gals playing teens ) until the van runs out of gas and the " " girls " " are forced to hold up in secluded two-story mountain home . I won 't ruin the ending for you but this is one of those " " films " " where the person who is obviously the killer is not obviously the killer . Cheerleader Massacre would have been great if it were shot on film , directed by Joseph Zito and had special effects by Tom Savini . Instead it is an effect-less , shot-on-video travesty by Jim Wynorski . Ouch.I beg of you , please don 't buy or rent this abomination . If we keep supporting these clowns , the more of this talentless video garbage they 'll produce .

" Blazing saddles ! It 's a fight between two estranged brothers ( Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard ) , both of whom can ignite fires mentally ; they square off over childhood differences , with dippy love-interest Debra Winger caught in the middle . Director Glenn Gordon Caron ( the TV whiz-kid behind " " Moonlighting " " ) smothers the darkly-textured comedy in Vince Gilligan 's screenplay with a presentation so slick , the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant . It has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature , but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities . These aren 't even characters , they 're plot functions . Barely-released to theaters , the film is a disaster , although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good .

" This program would be useful for training hardened felons basic human emotions . Beyond this purpose , the show has no value other than to fill bandwidth that would otherwise go unutilized in the electromagnetic spectrum . I feel a greater sense of suspense and anticipation listening to a computerized voice chip endlessly droning out the products of a random number generator . Fortunately , the helpful and frequent music cues will tell viewers how they 're supposed to feel , in case they are unable to fully internalize the predictable and shallow plot line . I did find Amy to be a superficially positive character , as she is a role model to young women that they can serve in traditionally male fields . Unfortunately , her totally subjective approach to the law is guided solely by whatever capricious personal guidelines Amy elects to employ , resulting in Amy 's trials more closely resembling appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than a true administration of justice .

" Visually , this film is interesting . Light is literally thrown in a way , together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles , that had my hopes up at the start , but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie , no matter how much spectacle is seen . This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish , one of the most well-known serial-killers in the world . Active around the start of the 20th century , Fish 's life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age . This film is based upon two tracks : Fish 's life and that of William F. King , lead investigator of the case . What saves this film from becoming a Hallmark spectacle and debacle of the usual sort , whenever films about serial killers are concerned , is the direction , which is a double-edged sword ; director Scott L. Flynn sheds focus enough upon the b-actors not to let their flaws shine through too much , but at the same times created a truly dull and stereotypical view of the American police through the King-angle . Sure enough he dealt quite thoroughly with Fish 's meet with Grace Budd , the 10-year-old girl that he killed , even though I 'm not really sure if her mother was the media-crazed person that Flynn really tries to emphasise that she was . I miss more psychological diving into Fish , not to mention the very little time which was spent on Fish 's post-capture . All in all , interesting for those who are into serial-killers , but mostly a let-down ; however , if the director will make another film about another serial-killer , I 'd definitely see it in hopes that holes were patched-up . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A stunning film which brought into the open so much about disability that generally makes people afraid . It showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled individual.Love , friendship , fear , frustration , joy , humour and so many others things were so well captured . The 2 lead characters were very well played by the 2 able bodied actors and invited your laughter , tears , concern , joy and dismay.I approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation worrying that it might be too much a play for sympathy or dwell only on negatives .

" Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style , Gabriele Muccino 's project is rather mediocre . The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end : hearts human and emotional , eyes physical and metaphorical . Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Alejandro Gonz찼lez I챰찼rritu 's Amores Perros and 21 Grams , with lots and lots of flashbacks .

" Gordon Scott made some good Tarzan movies , but this is not one of them.As I watched it , wincing at the bad , obviously interior sets and the hollow wooden " " clonking " " sounds as they walked across supposedly dirt trails , and cringing at the bad dialog and worse acting among the supporting cast , I kept thinking , " " Sheesh ! This is TV show level ! " " Then I find out it was , indeed , three TV show pilot episodes woven seam-fully into one.It 's nice to see Scott get outside ( alone ) , away from the lame sets , in a few of the scenes ; and the fights do have some pretty nice moves ... but oh , ow , and ouch as to the dialog . And did I mention the acting ? Heck , Cheetah ( or " " Cheta , " " in this version ) was a better actor than most of the humans.And that 's not saying much.It is kind of a stitch to see a younger Sherman ( i.e. Scatman ) Carothers acting as a native .

" Where to start with ' Speck ' the true story of Richard Speck , a killer of eight nurses in the 1960s . Director Keith Walley has worked on a few of the extremely low budget Full Moon Releasing movies ( such as Birth Rite ) and here works from a script by ( at the time ) Full Moon regular Don Adams . Unfortunaly whilst the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime the script isn 't great , perhaps because the real Speck 's ramblings were not terribly interesting ! ? Despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic it wreaks of a cheap cash-in of the acclaimed cinematic serial killer movies of the same period ( such as ' Ed Gein ' ) . Filmed in a dirty brown , not quite sepia , for the most part and narrated by star Doug Cole the film fails to present the horror of the crime because the narration is irritating , the colouring distracting from the story and the crime , though gruesome and upsetting to watch , is merely that and no editorial work seems to have occurred on what is pretty much a very poor quality camcorder viewing on the events . There is no examination of the motivation or of Speck 's life really , just a cheap shot at a gruesome crime . Released by Full Moon there is little evidence of Full Moon 's better output here , Charles Band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings ( e.g. dolls , monsters and so on ) and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality . Incidentally Band introduced a special label for these films called ' Shadow Entertainment ' . Band has said that he regrets the period of Full Moon output alongside Tempe Entertainment ( whose Creator J.R. Bookwalter and regular Danny Draven also speak very badly of Charles Band ) . The Tempe era features uniform Apple Mac editing and brutal hand-held camera filming , very much like a home movie . Speck retains these qualities and whereas Witchouse 3 , for example , managed to use these well , Speck is merely boring and gross . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie started off well enough , sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch . The soundtrack was torturously bad . Saxaphone and electric guitars ? It was gratingly incongruous . The female singer was positively dreary ! In the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn . Too dark for Austen . Northanger Abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to Catherine 's eyes.Who in the heck is this Marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig ? A totally extraneous and unnecessary character.One of the key elements in the book is the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine 's books . His monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his children 's spirits and his treatment of Catherine based on money concerns alone . He does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send Miss Morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home . Only her friend Miss Tilney 's thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded . This whole point gets seriously muddled in the film . They make the General too dark from the outset.Peter Firth should have not sung ! This part was painful to watch . His depiction of Tilney wasn 't too bad but it was a shade dark in places . Henry Tilney of the book made sport of Miss Morland 's imagination on trip to Northanger but he was never dark . Firth would have benefited from better direction . The young lady who played Isabella needed a better acting coach . John Thorpe was appropriately odious . The striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly ! It certainly fit his character.I think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack . It cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie . If I watch it again it will be with the sound OFF and subtitles on . Perhaps I would give the film a 4 then.The sound quality of the DVD was quite poor . The picture quality was not much better . This is glaringly noticeable on a digital television.When I think of what this film could have been , I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the only movie I have ever seen that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site , and that is a significant statement from someone who likes " " The Attack of the Monolith Monsters . " " This movie is perfect for anyone who wants an inoffensive movie . It is devoid of sex and violence , for example . I believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages . This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained , challenged , or stimulated in any way . Adults could easily catch up on their sleep in front of the TV while the kids watch this movie . Don 't be surprise , however , if you wakeup to find the kids have turned the TV off and started a board game . As an adult who enjoys being entertained , who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism , drama , comedy , and action , all of those adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate the imagination , this movie has nothing to offer . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The plot for Descent , if it actually can be called a plot , has two noteworthy events . One near the beginning - one at the end . Together these events make up maybe 5 % of the total movie time . Everything ( and I mean _ everything _ ) in between is basically the director 's desperate effort to fill in the minutes . I like disturbing movies , I like dark movies and I don 't get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy / dark ( literally ) scenes with NO storyline you have another thing coming . Rosario Dawson , one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here . And no , she doesn 't get naked , not even in the NC-17 version , which I saw.If you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch " " Descent " , " take a nap instead - you 'll probably have more interesting dreams . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What an insult to Olivia D 'Abo who plays the film 's heroine , Robin , to have Keanu Reeves appear so large on the box art of the film ( and at least on recent reissues , to have only Reeves appear on the box ) , considering that she was the star . I realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this long-forgotten After School Special , but at least give the woman some credit . Despite that , this has to be one of the worst teen sports-themed films that I have ever seen , and it strives very hard to add not only every teen and sports movie clich챕 from the class warfare between the feuding gymnasts to the teen romance . And , in striving to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of Flashdance ( with the music in one of the warehouse dance scenes is even quite close to Michael Sembello 's notable ' Maniac ' which was made famous by Flashdance , or was it the other way around ? ) . It includes similar dance sequences and worse yet , even the 80s dance and sports traditions of corny dance-offs between the heroine and her antagonist ( s ) , the one who doubts her successes and abilities on the team . We saw this in Trashin ' ( a vert ramp joust ) and Rad ( BMX dancing at the prom , although it wasn 't much for competition , but rather for fun ) for example . In fact , this movie is chock full of unrealistic corniness , such as the somewhat homo-erotic rolling in the clothes at the Salvation Army with Robin and her friend from the team.Nonetheless , the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background . To top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible , she lives with her ailing mother , her obnoxious sister , and her careless ( and slightly abusive ) stepfather . Needless to say , homelife is not so appealing . Add to the mix , a talent for gymnastics , but several obstacles to joining the team ( including the nuisance of her arrogant , snobby teammates , and a coach who also eventually doubts her abilities to compete well ) . And , of course , we can 't forget that she 's got eyes for one of the pretty boy preppies who is dating one of the obnoxious teammates , nor that she doesn 't have a steady boyfriend ( although Keanu as Tommy later enters the picture ) . Could this kid be any more pathetic ? And it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long , redundant , and clich챕d quest to prove her worth to everyone.But , even the major moments of cheesiness which comprise most of the film , are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog . ( I like how the gym coach suddenly appears at the diner in the middle of the dance-off to scold the teammates ) . It makes episodes of ' Amazing Stories ' look like Shakespeare.I imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor . For that you might be satisfied , but it is also an incredibly forced drama . So , Caveat Emptour . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A pretty obvious thriller-by-numbers , in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding to nothing . I was watching principally for the English-language performance by Isabelle Huppert . It wasn 't great , but then it was a strange role . I wouldn 't be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cutting-room floor along with several last minute script re-writes.The acting is the least appealing thing about this film . Steve Guttenburg looks like he 's trying to flesh out his role with the charm that everyone 's told him he has . There 's a sensationally stupid sequence in which it 's suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat PTSD . It 's an uninteresting performance . Elizabeth McGovern is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but it 's small consolation . 3 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie starts out with this creepy song that gave me some chills like the song used in " " Nightmare on Elmstreet " " ! It immediately sets the mood ! The sequence that follows also shows what to expect ! We are made aware that a ghost is present ! The mystery concerning this ghost is what keeps this movie together ! But the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to make sense of it ! The ideas behind the plot are quite interesting ! Only the way it is told to us is far too abstract ! I understand that the director believed that he had to maintain the mystery as long as possible ! The problem is that when certain matters get revealed you never get a satisfying explanation ! The motives of the important characters are left out and some questions raised in the movie don 't get answered at all ! Since we don 't learn enough about the characters it becomes hard to care for them ! And as a consequence you will loose interest ! Only some scares and a twist save this movie from becoming a total failure ! The twist is interesting but no real shocker ! The experienced viewer will see it coming ! Some reviewers complain that this movie is too much like " " Ringu " " and is not original at all ! Well it is true that some of the effects and scares are borrowed from that movie ! But there is a main difference ! The suspense in " " Ringu " " mainly was based on this one twist where the viewer finds out how the characters get killed ! ! In " " Ryeong " " ( the " " Ringu " " like ) twist is used as a creepy effect to accompany another crazy twist ! " " Ryeong " " heavily depends on a complex structured plot and twist that doesn 't contain enough scares to hold your interest ! Simply put : This isn 't a scary movie ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * * * POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW * * * What a long and mostly uninteresting movie ! Who were these characters ? Why didn 't I care about them ? If I 'm going to watch a movie for two hours , I 'd like to care about somebody or something . We know that Salvatore dreamed of the riches to be found in the new world . Beyond that , though , we learned little about most of his family 's hopes , fears , etc . , as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown.And why was Lucy even in this movie ? She said little ; we knew little about her or what she was doing ( was she forced to service men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship ? ) or what her plans were upon reaching New York . To those who might suggest that she was needed to underscore the point that a single woman , however cultured , could not get into this country alone , I say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time . That point could have been made in five minutes , with Lucy as a momentary character.More questions : Why wasn 't the twin brother at the boat to meet the family ? We heard about the brother , and some closure on that point would have been helpful in giving the movie some cohesiveness . Also , how long was the journey from Italy to New York ? Given the conditions on the ship , it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days . ( Someone said something about seeing land a " " week " " at one point , but I think that was when they were already en route . ) I needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going through.The only scene I really liked was when the boat , filled with passengers , left the dock . If you choose to rent this movie , do so with remote in hand ; you may want the Fast Forward button handy.Finally , may I suggest that , with the right voice-over providing helpful information about the times and the circumstances for immigrants--particularly during the slow stretches of endless shots of the countryside , people walking , etc.--this movie might have made an interesting public TV documentary . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP 's . And this one surely is an OOP . One year after The Exorcist she 's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of Blair never broke out , she never became a mega star . That 's one of the reason 's many of her films are OOP . She gives a good performance in this movie . It 's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn 't have any friends . Played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14 , that 's funny . The movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity . In most editions it 's cut out , why , I don 't know , no blood is involved , okay , Blair is butt naked but nothing is shown , no T & A so nothing to offend people . But the movie is slow , extremely slow . It doesn 't happy normally to me but I almost felt asleep . It 's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows , no gore no nothing . Why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me .

" This absurd movie was about a " " Goodie-two-shoe , " " teen-girl that really wanted to be Valedictorian but finds her obstacle in a teacher name Mrs. Tingle . Katie Holmes , who plays this " " goodie-two-shoe , " " is faced with " " the biggest dilemma of her teenage life " " when this classmate guy of hers comes along with the final exams sample that should help them nail Mrs. Tingle 's test . Mrs. Tingle comes along , catches Holmes , the classmate guy and her best friend with the sample of her final exam . Convinced that the three of them planned on cheating on here exam , Mrs. Tingle enthuses on her opportunity to ruin Holmes once and for all with allegations that can take away any chance of Holmes passing her class . And the classmate guy , who apparently has his eye on Holmes , always wondered why she never gave him the time of day ( he 's an idiot ) ? Feeling desperate , Holmes and her friends visit Mrs. Tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her in believing that Holmes was planning to cheat . It all backs fire somehow when the classmate guy points a bow and arrow at Mrs. Tingle , threatening her to make things right for Holmes . Mrs. Tingle fights back but ultimately ends up as Holmes and her friend 's captive.During Mrs. Tingle captivity under Holmes , they do everything from tying her up and gagging her in her own bed to blackmailing her with false pictures that they took of the unconscious Coach in bed with Mrs. Tingle . I found myself cringing when the kids were making themselves at home in Mrs. Tingle 's house , eating up her food and going though her private work . At one point , Holmes found Mrs. Tingle 's grade book and purposely changes the grade in her favor , decreasing the grade of her challenge for valedictorian . The end played out like a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was sparingly in the beginning of the film , resolving on pure irony , slapstick and absurdity.This has to be the most unlikable and wickedly evil character Holmes would ever play in her entire life . I wanted to help Mrs. Tingle get free to really dig a grave for Holmes . She was manipulative , selfish and conniving . She even slept with the classmate guy despite her best friend 's overwhelming interest in him ... and she didn 't like him . From attempting to ruin her challengers grades by seizing Mrs. Tingle 's grade book to taking her best friend 's man , you would think that Holmes would get what she deserves in the end , right ? Unfortunately , she obtains everything her heart desires , showing that being wicked , manipulative , selfish and whining can get you what you want.Mrs. Tingle was suppose to be the character you didn 't like . They didn 't bring me to that point once to believe that she was this woman that needed to be " " taught this lesson . " " She was like every other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her resentment of the next generation . Personally , I felt that her opinions about young people were validated with Holmes and her friend 's actions every time . I kept hoping she could get free to call the police and nail Holmes . They kept her tied up in bed , ate up her food like a bunch of pigs , drank up the woman 's wine , messed with her personal belongings and we 're suppose to believe that she didn 't deserve to take a bat to each of their heads ? And the classmate guy has to be one of the most disliked characters in the history of film . Forget idiot , we need a new word for him that isn 't in the Webster 's dictionary . He brought the major trouble into Holme 's life then made things worse when he came into Mrs.Tingle 's house , uninvited behind Holmes , and corners Mrs. Tingle with a bow and arrow . I was thrilled every time Mrs. Tingle had a chance to slap fire out of him , or choke the wannabe actress best friend.If you 're a teen out there and want to see when a teen 's manipulation and wrong doing can get him or her the world , see this unfunny , caricature filled , unintentional film noir . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Her embalmed look was totally inappropriate for the role . Her face remained too white , hair too coifed , clothes etc. too clean ( and well-fitting , especially her father 's old hat and coat in the scene where Inman comes home ) for any sense of accuracy . It would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect , too , but she was the only one who didn 't get messy . There was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek . Are we to believe she was the only person in the Civil War with a bathtub and a mirror ? She certainly looked like the only one who used them . Tweezers , too ; I mean , what 's with those eyebrows ? She looked absolutely mean ! The love story was implausible . She only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute . So , she goes over to tease him , then flirts with him a couple more times , and suddenly this is a love on a par with Odysseus and Penelope ?

He sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one.The story was pretty awful too , could someone just fall in love with a girl because she 's pretty but has the mind of a child ?

" America needs the best man possible to win " " The game " " so who do they hire ? A gymnast ( Oh brother ! ) played by Kurt Thomas who has the necessary skills to win in a game which involves ninjas , a village of crazies and Richard Norton who is told by Kurt Thomas " " to keep his hardware in his pants .

The first thing that went through my mind was just how lame these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass . Kurt Thomas is like 5 foot 4 and he hardly strikes one as " " The best man for the job " " As to the acting talent of Kurt Thomas , well if you can 't say something nice ... In all seriousness though one has to wonder how much cocaine was being used to furnish an idea so stupid . Only the decision to cast Tara Reid as a scientist tops the dumbness here . For 18 years though this held the title of the dumbest movie I had ever seen . Not to say I didn 't find this unwatchable , I was laughing so hard I almost choked to death . Twice . Only in the 80 's could a movie with such a bad idea get made . Although for the record it is the only movie to ever feature a hero so wimpy , he can 't even pull a wedged sword out from the ground . This is the wimpiest action movie ever made , and one of the most hilarious also . * out of 4- ( Bad ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I ? 셝 been interested in watching this ever since it was cited as the Worst Film Ever on an entry devoted to 1950s sci-fi cinema in a British periodical from the early 1980s entitled ? 쏷he Movie ? ? ( incidentally , the Leonard Maltin Film Guide also awarded this the unenviable BOMB rating ) . When it came out on DVD last year , I became interested in purchasing the ? 쏞ult Camp Classics ? ? Box Set in which it was included ( along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [ 1958 ] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [ 1959 ] ) ; however , since recently acquiring QUEEN on DVD-R , I had put paid to the idea.Happily , I ? 셶e just stumbled upon the film on DivX ? ? however , the print wasn ? 셳 culled from the Warners DVD ( which is said to boast a surprisingly pleasant-looking transfer ) but rather a muddy TV print ? 쫡hough not so much that the detail is lost ( in other words , it was like watching the film in sepia as opposed to black-and-white ! ) . Anyway , to get to the matter at hand : I have to admit that , in a way , I was disappointed the film didn ? 셳 prove to be the laugh-fest I had anticipated all this time ( Maltin calls it ? 쐆ilariously awful ? ? ; actually , I found it quite engaging ? ? and thankfully brief at a little over an hour in length . Some undeniably amusing bits remain though ? ? such as when the old nurse starts screaming her head off at the sight of the 50-foot woman , and when the Sheriff ? 셲 deputy almost runs over his chief and the leading lady ? 셲 butler in his enthusiasm to be of assistance in such an unusual case . Neither did the special effects hit me as being ? 쏿mong the funniest ? ? ( Maltin again ) on film ? ? though they ? 셱e certainly embarrassingly bad ! O.K. , so the idea that an alien ( in giant-sized human form , clad in cave-man rags , and radioactive to boot ! ) coming to Earth in a big ball-shaped ( ! ) spaceship and apparently after the heroine ? 셲 prized necklace is utter nonsense ? ? and his quasi-transparent appearance does it no favors at all ? 쫇ut , really , it ? 셲 the human story that holds our attention ( relatively speaking ) . The character of the philandering husband isn ? 셳 very interesting , but his two women are : wealthy but nagging alcoholic wife Allison Hayes and ambitious , vixenish girlfriend Yvette Vickers . Also involved in the narrative are Hayes ? ? faithful servant ( already mentioned ) , a couple of cops ( one of them , as noted elsewhere , being amiably goofy ) and as many doctors ( one of whom is named Dr. Cushing [ ! ] and another a specialist who ? 셲 called in when Hayes starts growing in size after being exposed to radiation ) .Of course , the film could be seen as the reversed female version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN ( 1957 ) ? ? though it wouldn ? 셳 be fair to compare the two further , as the Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson classic is far more psychological / intellectual in approach ; actually , Hayes doesn ? 셳 seem to be that bothered with her ? 쁟ondition ? ? and , in fact , takes advantage of it in order to teach her husband a lesson ! However , her rampage ? ? exaggerated in movie posters of the era ? ? is rather quaint ( especially when considering that it only occurs in the last ten minutes or so ) ; when not shown the damage caused by her enormous but highly unconvincing hand ( especially when lifting the puppet that ? 셲 supposed to be her husband ! ) , she ? 셲 mostly seen walking in long shot and almost from behind ( with her size even inconsistent in proportion to the buildings she passes by ) ! ! Still , Hayes ? ? demise via electrocution ( when she bumps into an electrical cable ) is competently done.Finally , I followed this with its 1993 TV remake with Daryl Hannah as the titular creature ? ? which I rented specifically for this purpose . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" At one point , Violet ( Lucy Liu ) tells Neil ( Cillian Murphy ) that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure . She said " " because I 'm bore-phobic " . " It mean that she can 't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities . Well , I think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic . Because " " Watching the Detectives " " is a cheer boredom . Have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once ? Neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop . He and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward . But Neil 's life is completely turned around when Violet walks into his store . She 's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him . Anyway , after some dates , they decide to see each other . The problem is Violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on Neil and can 't really doing something normal , whereas Neil is completely opposite to hers . The question is . Is they are going to be in love at the end ? You bet . " " Watching the Detectives " " is a clich챕 romantic-comedy to its core . And they made it even worst by pretending to be something else . From the first couple of set-up , we know that Neil is pretty laid-back guy who didn 't really commit to anything . And then , Violet enters the scene , looking all weird and annoying . So at this point , we all know that we 're going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they 're going to end up in the end . Is it worth waiting for ? I would say no.As I said , they tried to give something more for the audience . " " Watching the Detectives " " is trying to talk about commitment . To observe how far people go to reach for something they desire . We knew in the end that insane things that Violet has done is all the test how far Neil is ready to go to win her heart ( or whatever ) . Well , I think it is completely bullshit . This movie will end pretty quick if Neil just said to himself " " Forget about it , that girl is one of a nutjob ! " " After collaborating with many great directors recently ( Danny Boyle 's " " Sunshine " " and " " 28 Days Later " , " Ken Loach 's " " The Wind That Shakes the Barley " " and Neil Jordan 's " " Breakfast on Pluto " " to name a few ) , it 's pretty weird choice for Cillian Murphy to make a movie with one of Broken Lizard comedy troop , Paul Soter . By all means , He 's not bad ( as usual ) , but such a talent actor like him shouldn 't be wasting his time in the movie like this . On the other hand , Lucy Liu is dreadfully awful as Violet . Her acting is a mess . I mean it 's all over the place and so over-the-top . Tony Montana would have been proud.The last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title . You simply can 't really connect a dot between the plot and its title ; and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all . In short , " " Watching the Detectives " " is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable TV so quick that you couldn 't imagine.BloodyMonday Rating : 1.5 / 4 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Also , other people say this is a spoof , but I don 't think so . For a spoof , you need something called " " humor " .

The monster , while hard to kill , doesn 't do much besides shuffle around and roar . Oh , and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks . It was a slightly interesting , yet a total Alien ripoff.What was the deal with the scientist playing the Xylophone to attract the monster ? It was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality . Also , why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long ? Why didn 't the monster go into the closet when it had a chance ? Why do I insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones , I wondered once again , why remake a good movie ? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha . It was a clear rip off . Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love . I couldn 't believe Abigail Breslin . Martina Gedeck owned this role . Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another one that she could own ( she has other roles she does own . ) . Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian . Aaron Eckhart seemed passionless in comparison . This version was pleasant but bland.The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying . The therapist added an interesting bit of color that didn 't seem important . I liked it when at the end he said he 'd be back but the movie was over before he returned . I have Mostly Martha at home . Every now and then I revisit it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hey , If your going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen try making it about Leonard Cohen ! This is filled with only enough Leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers ( some of them questionable ) talk about themselves . Puleeze .... sounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high - who cares about you , what about Leonard ? Guess what people , if you " " do something " " worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you . I found particularly insulting the parading of U2 's members as if that would add credibility to this movie - NOT . Leonard doesn 't need Bono or the Edge talking about his spirituality . What would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some piece of his spirituality through the film . Gee , what a concept ! I will give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their covers of Cohen tunes - the rest of the performances were a bore and some were unbearable.Cohen fans , don 't say I didn 't warn you ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Unlike " " The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai " , " or " " Big Trouble in Little China " , " or " " Conan the Barbarian " , " which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations , The Golden Child is just plain bad.The premise itself is not unworkable , and there are some funny moments . But here the Eddy Murphy " " flip attitude " " just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story . And the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension . The " " mystic secrets " " of Tibetan Buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel.Without a feeling that anything is at stake , or that the characters are faced by real danger , why should we care ? Who should see this film : -- big fans of Eddy Murphy who can 't help themselves-- I can 't think of anyone elseI 'll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" A dreary and pointless bit of fluff ( bloody fluff , but fluff ) . Badly scripted , with inane and wooden dialogue .

Perhaps some of the set and setting will interest--those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived . The framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting , and the Hoppalong Cassidy character himself is both boring and inept . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino ; an Italian crime drama partially filmed in Hamburg , Germany . An easily forgotten movie . Even in spite of a good car chase sequence , this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly . A new Don takes over a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life . Unwritten laws and ethics of the Mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake . Brutality and violence breed the same in return . This can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics . Just the look of the film brings back memories of American drive-in fare . Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas can 't boost the calibre of this crime drama .

" OK , please believe me when I say that this is a terrible , terrible , sci-fi movie . Its done so poorly that much of the film plays out as unintentional surrealism and its absolutely a 100 % waste of time . Awful , but somehow also deeply unfunny . I watched this as a double feature with " " Recon 2020 : The Caprini Massacre " " and although " " Battlespace " " WAS an incredibly superior film , that 's not saying much . The plot of " " Battlespace " " is so completely convoluted that its impossible to follow . The narration is cryptic , often nonsensical , seemingly endless , and thoroughly exhausting . Literally half the film is duplicative scenes of the female lead , who looks like Brian Bosworth , walking through the desert . The movie actually starts out pretty cool , but then nosedives into pooptown and somehow continues to deteriorate , minute by minute . Absolutely horrible and truly an Absurdist Endurance Test .

" Would a different translation have made it chillier or scarier ? Are the subtitles too compact to convey the nuances of the original language ? Does it even matter ? You may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting . Well , this is an opportunity to judge for yourself . If this isn 't about homosexuality , murder , dismemberment , psychopaths , insanity , deviant psychology , then it is about acting - acting helped along with lots of dialog , So , enjoy the acting or muse about how titillating the dialog actually is.For English speakers , " " Twelve Angry Men " " might be a better choice . There 's a bit more interaction , and you can judge if the acting is consistent with the dialog . You don 't have to wonder if you 're missing something.I would recommend Andy Warhol 's " " Empire " " to those who like this film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a horrid disaster of a film . From beginning to end , it 's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing . The only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by Streisand , because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to . The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristofferson 's character at his peak or Streisand 's character struggling . The first should be seen in decline and the second rising . The final Streisand number _ could have been _ one of the greatest finales in film , if it was directed and edited properly . The single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake . Had the band , audience and wide shots of the stage been shown , this number could have been dynamic and interesting . This film must have been directed and edited by an NYU film school dropout . The only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay . The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film , and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" simply i just watched this movie just because of Sarah & am also giving these 4 stars just because of her , on the other side This movie was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Theacting was horrible . The script was uninspired . This was a movie that kept contradicting itself . The film was sloppy and unoriginal. its not like I was expecting a good film . Just something to give me a jump or two . This did not even do that.he worst thing is that , the more I think about the overall plot , the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding . A real shame really , as I 'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere ... I 'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4 / 10 but given the actors involved and again SARA obvious writing talent , this film really should have delivered far more.This movie is just crap , I cant put it differently . Since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap.The story , dialogue , acting , special effects , make-up , pretty much EVERYTHING sucks . I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing , I can 't believe how somebody produced this thing.It 's not even about vampires , it 's more about a dream / reality experience . The development of the movie is incoherent , the motivation of the characters is ... Doesn 't exist , everything seems like a big joke . Maybe that 's what they tried to do , but I sincerely doubt it . I wish I knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired , it 's definitely one of the worst movies I 've ever seen in my life ( and I 've seen many bad movies , but nothing compared to this ) Please , make yourselves a favor and do NOT watch this.P.S. It 's also full of clich챕s ! P.S. 2 Bad Script , Bad directing , Bad cinematography . P.S. 3 I bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really wish I had read everyone 's review before going to see the movie ... it was one of the most excruciating films that I 've ever seen . I was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes into the movie ; I should have followed my instinct . The movie offered nothing new or clever , it was boring and very clich챕 . I was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman ! The characters did not represent any women that I know , they were boring , bitter and melodramatic . The movie was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money . And the actors looked tired , poor make-up and hair styling . It was recently compared to the Sex and in the City movie ; it was not even half as good . My suggestion , do not see this movie ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Kairo , or Pulse as it 's known amongst English speaking audiences , is set in Tokyo & starts as Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo ( Kumiko Aso ) decides to visit her friend Taguchi ( Kenji Mizuhashi ) to enquire about a computer disk he 's been working on , when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her . Meanwhile a student named Ryosuke Kawashima ( Haruhiko Kato ) has recently hooked up to the internet & keeps getting spooky messages & images on his monitor so he ask 's computer whizz Harue Karasawa ( Koyuki ) whats happening , she doesn 't really know but it seems that the place where people 's spirits go when they die is full & they need somewhere else to go & Earth is as good a place as any , right ? These spirits don 't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that , I don 't really know because the films a bit of a mess ... This Japanese production was written & directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa & right off the bat I have to say I hated Kairo , I hated everything about it & it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Asian cinema can produce something as crap as any American filmmaker . The script is an overlong mess , the thing simply doesn 't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film , sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way & Kairo is also the most downright boring film I 've sat through this year . At two hours long this is a real chore to sit through , I really wanted to fast-forward it but I 'm fair if nothing else so I stuck it out to the bitter end & frankly wished I hadn 't . There are so many things wrong with Kairo , I suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous & deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which I despise in a film unless they are done properly . Then there 's the whole internet thing which I just couldn 't relate to at all , I use the internet all day & it 's not in the least bit scary to me in any way . Then there 's the fact that Kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me , maybe I 'm a Neanderthal but I kind of like the films I watch to entertain me , make some sort of sense & not bore me to death.Director Kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as I 'm concerned , if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the DVD & you be fast asleep within 10 minutes I guarantee you . I didn 't think Kairo was scary in the slightest , the whole internet thing was laughable & as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement pop-up ads I get , now that 's scary ! I hate this film , I hate this film , I 'm sorry I just need to make that basic point again , twice . Forget about any action , tension or gore as there isn 't any . If you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly PG rated stuff all the way . Urgh.The film looks so dull & boring it 's untrue , the camera just sits there for very long shots & when it does move it moves very slowly , this has all the style of a Mexican soap opera . Since Kairo is sub titled it 's difficult to judge the original performances so I won 't bother , it 's hard to care for someone when they don 't even speak the same language & you don 't know what they are saying.Kairo is crap , I hated it & it 's as simple & straight forward as that . Just because it 's an Asian flick doesn 't automatically make it any good & the mess of a story , the plot holes , the fact it makes no sense & it 's an absolute bore means Kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an American production . The worst film I 've seen this year by some distance . Kairo got a Hollywood remake as Pulse ( 2006 ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am in awe of the number of people who consider this film to be decent ... much less great ! Do the majority of people even have basic standards for a film they watch ? I just don 't know anymore.This " " commercial cinematic product " " doesn 't really deserve the respect of being called a film . To call Dean Cain talented is a gross injustice to anyone who actually has talent . I have had a lot of respect for Lori Petty but most of that has gone right down the tubes . At least her role was extremely small . Maybe she had a bill that desperately needed to get paid.The ignorance I saw while viewing " " Firetrap " " was amazing . Let me start out by getting this off my chest : if you can 't show fire realistically then don 't show it at all . Okay ? ! ! It 's an embarrassment to all involved when you show lame effects that don 't even come close to simulating an actual burning building.Some interesting tidbits : 1 . A janitor opens the door to a large storage closet and finds the entire room engulfed in flames . What does he do ? He tries to put out the fire with his broom ! 2 . The same janitor ( who knows the building is on fire ) later comes across a door marked " " HAZARDOUS MATERIALS " . " His brilliant mind tells him that it would be a great idea to open said door . Big mistake ! 3 . A woman is giving a fantastically generous donation of $ 100,000 to a greyhound rescue fund but ... she 's wearing a fur coat to the charity event they 're holding ! ( Wouldn 't people who care about animals kinda frown on that sort of thing ? ) 4 . Several of the people in the movie are forced into a vault of some sort with massive steel walls that even an electromagnetic pulse ( ! ! ) couldn 't penetrate . Yet they have a spacious air vent leading right into the back of the thing that anyone could crawl through . That sure seems like a lapse in security.I could go on and on but I have grown tiresome thinking about this lame movie . Our " " hero " " whom we are supposed to be cheering for is a career criminal who early on tries to kill some police officers . What a swell guy ! If the general public wants to waste their minds away on this drivel then more power to them . I just wish I could have it erased from my memory . 1 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just watched that movie , and was pretty disappointed . I didn 't expect much to begin with as the premise of the movie doesn 't suggest greatness anyway . Sadly , it doesn 't even manage to deliver just as stupid entertainment . The main problem is probably the acting . While I 've seen far worse actors in far worse movies , the story would require some people to act out as violent maniacs , some others as people caught a in really stressing predicament , and they fail to deliver that . Although I watched the German release I watched with the original audio , so it 's definitely not just bad voice-overs or anything like that . Added to that , the German DVD release seems to be cut , the killings are all pretty much left out , meaning that except for a few semi-gory scenes closer to the end the German release doesn 't deliver as a movie for " " gore-hounds " , " either . Can 't comment on that for other releases of course . The plot has some stupid moments thrown in here and there and the beginning is just hilarious ( ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist ? ) . Too bad the movie takes itself far too seriously , if it was filmed as a horror-comedy and changed a bit here and there accordingly it might have worked better . The ending is just a huge disappointment.If you 've got really nothing better to do and just can 't stand the boredom anymore you might ( and it 's really a weak " " might " " ) consider this movie . If there 's anything else available to watch or do : Pick that alternative . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Terrible direction from an awful script . Even the DVD looked muddy and out of focus . Laughable accents all over the map . Unlike most of the other commenters I had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud , but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn-out shots of nude or scantily-clad young men , usually wet or glistening with sweat , looking longingly at each other . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" While channel surfing , we found this movie with its promising synopsis . We were dismayed at the flat acting , and formulaic storyline . We found amusing the exploding car scenes , unbelievable shoot outs , and sets that crash down with the weight of tyro-foam and cardboard . What was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from " " Dante 's Peak " , " where the church front falls on the school bus , the store fronts break away from the main street , the overpass collapsing , and the red truck speeding down the alley way as the bricks fall down on it . It was a good laugh although unintended , and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally intended as a low budget spoof of disaster films . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-tv movie will move you , but then , as it diverges more and more from the book , taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches , it becomes boring . Still , from comments I 've heard , people who have not read the book tend to like it , and if it leads even on child to read A Wrinkle in Time , it will have served its purpose . The most embarrassing change is to make the Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins ' Uncle Albert ( I love to Laugh ) . Nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Not really spoilers in my opinion , but I wanted to cover myself , nevertheless . As the executive producer , Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 Items Or Less , a movie with an intentional indie-feel , and just be absorbed in the mentor / be-all-that-you-can-be theme . He plays a alternate universe , semi-washed up version of the real Morgan Freeman , who is chauffeured in an old Econovan by a kid all the way into Carson , CA from Brentwood to research his next movie role . Why Carson , is a mystery to So . Cal residents . He could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements . Paz Vega is pretty to watch , a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz , playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for Moragn Freeman 's research . His character is only known as " " Him " " to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people- " " Psst , that 's ' him , ' etc . Unfortunately , I was too distracted that Him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in Brentwood , carried no cash or debit card , or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him . If one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like Him does , then I gotta see cash and a Blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which Him definitely has . Nothing really happens in this movie . I don 't believe that either of the main character 's were substantially changed by their encounter with each other . It flirts with the idea of adultery , but then that thought fizzles . This to me was similar to Steve Martin 's Shopgirl , without the sexual affair . It was self-indulgent for Freeman and unconvincing to the audience . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ill-conceived sequel ( .. the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather ) brings back the spirit of the psychopath , returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which reintroduce life to his molecules ( .. it 's the best I could do to explain this preposterous concept ) .I could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists , but I simply find no reason to bother because it 'd all be so exhausting . Anyway , the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival ( .. I mean seriously , why worry with even introducing them to us if we can 't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this ? ! ) .The " " snow anvil " " murder scene takes the cake . Ice icicles protrude from the beach 's sand so that a victim can fall on them . Oh , and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs.Look I get what 's coming to me when I sit down to watch a killer snowman movie .. such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your funnybone ( " " Oh , it 's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie ! " " ) or have you pondering why the hell you 're wasting time with such nonsense . Jack Frost has the power to freeze water ( .. then how were they able to melt him in the first film ? ) and causes the island resort to snow . One sequence has Jack freezing pool water , encasing a swimming model under the sheet , result being her drowning with nowhere to escape.Oh , there 's also a recreation of the " " tongue stuck to the icy pole " " bit from The Christmas Story ( " " Cowatonga dude ! " " ) .I gotta hand it to the cast , though .. they 're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining . Christopher Allport ( .. perhaps unwisely ) returns as Sam , to face his old nemesis , as does Eileen Seeley , as his wife . The attempts at tongue-in-cheek humor ( .. for me , at least ) fell flat , but the cast soldiers onward trying to make the most of a very difficult situation , with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue.A development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with Jack , his genetically altered water molecules , thanks to the introduced foreign elements , allow him to withstand coolant / anti-freeze , and , even worse , he now can reproduce .. through indigestion , Jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes , mouth and sharp teeth ! The killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly-laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans , but I personally found this junk rather hokey ( .. that 's the purpose behind it , I suppose , cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this ) and unbearable.The snowball offspring is an obvious homage to Gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort . The weapon against them .. bananas ! It 's explained that when Jack went to kill Sam in the first film , both fell in a truck bed full of anti-freeze ( .. an icicle emerging from Jack 's belly was penetrating Sam 's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed , and I guess in their being " " being linked " " by the icicle , Jack inherited Sam 's banana allergy , or so this is what we are led to believe ! ) and in doing so both " " merged " " in a sense.Phew , such a film as this defies simple explanation . It 's a film with effects and plot so terrible , one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it 's many failings . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" From reading the back of the box my first thought was that this is probably a knock off of Saw 2 . I couldn 't be further from the truth . It seemed to me like they gave somebody with downsyndrom a camera phone and $ 10.00 and told them to make a movie . The plot didn 't exist and neither did the acting . It was almost as if I was watching a silent film about grass growing . It didn 't surprise me at all to find out later that the entire film was " " improvised " .

" How the hell did they get this made ? ! Presenting itself as a caper comedy , the misbegotten " " $ " " is essentially two hours of people mumbling sentence fragments .

As for Gert Frobe , his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here . Not even the guy with the champagne bottle of LSD can save this litany of worthlessness.Am I comparing this movie to " " Plan 9 from Outer Space " " ? I wouldn 't do such a thing even if someone paid me . " " P9FOS " " was idiotically made but ended up hilarious ; this was idiotically made and causes you to feel like your brain just melted out of your ears . Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for this when they co-starred in " " Shampoo " , " but then they co-starred in the dreadful " " Town & Country " .

" I saw this move several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival if I recall . I liked it , it showed great potential .

" Where can I begin . I heard this movie was coming out and I was very mad . I am a huge fan of the original Carlito 's Way and when I heard about this , I thought it would be just like almost all the other sequels that come out in Hollywood . I thought it would be bad . Boy was I wrong , this movie was much worse than I expected . Not saying all sequels are bad , but thats the problem with Hollywood these days , they make too many sequels and remakes and rush them . This was not a theater release , it is a DVD release . Still , in my opinion , there was no reason at all for this to be made . After I heard about this film was in progress , I then later heard Pacino was not in it . That right away killed any chance this movie had of being good . Why did I check this movie out then some of you may ask ? Well I had the opportunity to see it so I did . I don 't only watch movies that I have high expectations of , I had low expectations on this one obviously . I just wanted to see if it would have anything relevant in it . Now , if any of you reading this are a Carlito 's Way fan , you know a lot of the story in the first one has to do with him going to jail . * VERY MINOR SPOILER * I wont ruin anything , because this may actually make you not want to waste 2 hours watching this trash . All I will say is- in the end of Carlito 's Way 2 , we don 't see Carlito go to jail . Now , I don 't know about any of you , but I would have thought a prequel to Carlitos Way would show how he ended up in jail . I even had some interest in actually seeing what happened.Now , thats not my only problem with the film . The actor who played Carlito did not do too bad a job , but he could not have saved this film if he tried . There 's not even all those little things that should be thrown in there that Carlito 's Way fans would like . You don 't see any appearance of Kleinfeld or other key characters in the first one , I would have liked to see something like that . What is even worse , is Luis Guzman is in this film , yet he doesn 't play the same character he plays in the first film . Big mistake on their part , why cast the same actor for a different character , it made the movie worse than it already was.Bottom line , I am a Carlito 's Way fan , this new straight to DVD release is a disgrace . If you are a fan , don 't watch this movie coming in with high expectations . This movie did basically nothing for me , and it is definitely one movie I wont be picking up on DVD , or watching ever again . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My wife and I watch a film every night with no distractions , and mostly artsy films that require thought . I have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom . My wife has double the attention span that I do . All that being said-- this film is just plain empty and BORING ! It went nowhere . Never blossomed . It started fairly strong with a promising plot ... then she bakes cookies ... goes to Spain .... she sulks , she stares .... the credits roll . Uneven , full of holes , false starts & dead ends . We FF 'd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space . Artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried . Zzzz ...... It 's like a beautifully shot chick-flick that 's pretending to be deep or artsy . You never get to know nor understand Morvern at all . About halfway through you just don 't care anymore . We just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop . Don 't waste your time on this . I 'm shocked it scores so high . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Although it has been 2 years , I still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie . Unfortunately , I came across this movie after my friends and I selected it while browsing through the new releases at Blockbuster . We decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable . Although it has been quite some time since I viewed the movie , I still remember the lack of plot ( seriously , there is no true plot ) , and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie .

" Stephen Seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path . However , the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and Seagal smells a rat who gave the police advanced notice .

" I made the mistake of buying this since I collect comic book inspired movies . Even at 6 $ it was too expensive . I thought there might be some campy fun in it , a " " so bad " " it becomes good vibe perhaps , I was wrong . I had watched it once long ago and didn 't remember any of it . Now I know why . I was bored out of my mind and was looking for distractions to do something else . I 'm all for grrrrl power , punk attitude and absurd humor but Tank Girl does not work on any front . The script is bad , you don 't care about the characters and the humor is mostly lame except for a few amusing one-liners . The special effects or locations are poor or often replaced by comic panels or animations that are just too jarring compared to the live-action . It 's like they didn 't have the money to shoot the cool stuff and so resorted to drawings , however cool they might be ( an uncensored animated feature would be way better for Tank Girl now that I think about it ) . The action scenes were cheesy but not in a fun b-movie way . The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic although it was interestingly decorated . As a matter of fact , the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation . It does have some interesting songs by known artists such as Bjork , Hole and Portishead but instead of improving the atmosphere , they just don 't fit most of the time . Once they even break into a ludicrous song and dance number that was just senseless and horrible . I think that 's when I totally tuned out . I suppose Tank Girl , played by Lori Petty , looks the trashy punkette part but beyond her " " attitude " " and sometimes barely amusing retorts , is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst comic book characters . Jet , played by Naomi Watts , is probably the only saving grace of the film and it 's amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess . Malcolm McDowell wasn 't too bad playing his usual villain role . It might be a cult movie for some but please consider that it 's really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie themselves ( check out the entry for Tank Girl on Wikipedia ) .

" Everyone knows that late night movies aren 't Oscar contenders . Fine . I mean I 'll admit that I was a bit tipsy and bored and figured I 'd get to some skin-a-max . It 's pretty bad when the info on the TV guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description . It even gave it half a star . To be fair , I did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was soooooooooo bad . I couldn 't stop laughing . I mean the words coming out of these people mouth and how they were trying to be serious . Most of the time I think the people on the screen were trying their hardest to not to laugh . In fact I think in one scene they did laugh . Anyways the movie didn 't make sense . It was like that one Sopranos episode with the fat gay guy . Only the Sopranos is great show . But it was terrible , I mean , no nudity , just sex scenes out of the 90 's . You know the kind that use shadows and silhouettes instead of flesh . I gave it a two cause this flick makes for a good drinking game movie . I mean with all the cheese , it helps to get the wine out . If its late at night , and all that is on TV is this and that Tony Little guy and his exercise bike , then I suggest Tony Little . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Before I go on I have to admit to being a huge Bon Jovi fan . In fact thats what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place . I probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first Vampires title so much.But this isn 't half as good . Not even Jon could save this film for me . My main problem would be that it simply isn 't scary . Apart from Jon 's character Derek Bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn 't care less whether they die or not , especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman . The female vampire simply isn 't scary or sexy . Rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl , no wonder she is so desperate for blood then . Another huge problem is that everything is just " " too bright " . " There is no atmosphere or sense of dread . I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico wasn 't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be . This film has no tension like that.The story is basically the same as before . Vampire wants Berzier 's cross to be able to walk in daylight . However the story has less cool bits this time . There is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master - the original vampire , as in the first film . You really don 't care who or what this one is . There is no army of masters . Instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a Disneyland attraction then a creepy temple.So there you have it really . Lack of scares , lack of atmosphere , lack of interesting story . A real let down for me personally . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Also , William Forsythe 's cast as a MacGyver-kick-ass-savingtheday- kinda hero lacks credibility . On the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark Paul bites another one to death . As a matter of fact I find bad b-movies quite amusing .

" I love cinema so what I 'm about to confess embarrasses me deeply . I had given a thumbs down to " " Che , Parts 1 and 2 " " without having seen the film . Terrible I know . But I felt into a trap perpetrated by ... who ? I don 't really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and , no matter how smart I think I am , I fell into it . But , thankfully , I bumped into an Argeninean film director , Martin Donovan , a man I love and admire . When I told him I wasn 't going to see it because I knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me right on the face and Donovan is a pacifist ! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why . I went to see both parts straight away and , " " Che , part 1 and 2 " " is the best film I 've seen in 2008 . It is , of such purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past . The regard for its audience is something that we 're not used to anymore . I don 't know if we ever were . Riveting , moving , without concessions and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary . We can see his soul , we can actually perceive it .

" Honestly , I went to see the movie , not because of the actors , not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category . Believe me , being a movie-freak , I have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime ( Ichi the killer , Irreversible , Hellraiser ) but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I have ever seen . The plot is plain stupid , the directing is awful , acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so-called " " Horror Soundtracks " . " There isn 't a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie , and some of the scenes are really hard to stand . ( especially the scene , where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries--horrible ) . I can 't understand why the movie was rated 16 in Germany , where normally the criteria are real tough ( e.g. kill-bill ( brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing ) even a movie like state of grace is rated 18 ) . No one can call this a Horror movie , because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public ( Showing the " " Creep 's " " face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision ) ; for me ( excuse my expression ) it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies . In some scenes you see violence , that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything . The plot has holes and flaws , the dialog is boring , honestly I can 't mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the British and Scottish accent.If I had something to say , I would ban this movie from the theaters , I fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap.I 'm looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and I 'd be happy to discuss about one or the other topic .

" Just imagine the real Hitler , who was a master of propaganda and speech , would have been such a mumbling moron as Carlyle portrayed him in this film.Nobody would have followed him , not even a desperate , unemployed guy in the 1920s.This is just a Hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself , disguised as " " true history " . " I pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show . Carlyle and the producers didn 't get anything right with this.Why was Hitler able to win so many people , a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage ? Why did people follow him to death ? By portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable . This film is a mixture of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century . Imagine a film about Churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins . This film is a disgrace and I wonder how they could talk an actor like Carlyle into this dreck . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there . This is by far not one of the worst out there , still not a good movie , but not the worst nonetheless . Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the Night Brings Charlie is the worst . The film has decent camera work and editing , which is way more than I can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films.The film doesn 't deliver on the on-screen deaths , there 's one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck , but all other deaths are hardly interesting . But the lack of on-screen graphic violence doesn 't mean this isn 't a slasher film , just a bad one.The film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously . The film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle , so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements , done in a tongue in cheek way . For example , after a kill , Charlie goes to the town 's ' welcome ' sign and marks the population down one less . This is something that can only get a laugh.If you 're into slasher films , definitely give this film a watch . It is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers , but not by much . The comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious . You may forget the movie , you may remember it .

" This is a joke , right ? This can 't be a real film ? It 's not even a real video ? Give any Harvey Milk High School kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this . The film maker 's can 't be serious ... right ? Is this satire ? Comedy ? Drama gone horribly wrong ? The script is about as single-minded and dull as is conceivable . Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay . The dialogue isn 't clich챕d . Clich챕d dialogue might elevate this holiday mess to something akin to camp fun - but it doesn 't and it isn 't . Worst of the worst - a landlady wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed a bathrobe carrying a frying pan like something out of a " " Honeymooners " " episode . Whaaa ? ? ? I have seen better acting from middle school drama clubs . One of the leads is an attractive lunk , the other is not . Both can 't even manage a convincing kiss . So much for romance . The supporting players are jaw-droppingly over-the-top.Everything is underscored by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a back room toilet . Most of the dialogue is ( mercifully ) unintelligible.This stale cinematic fruitcake isn 't even worthy of being the next ROCKY HORROR or a gay holiday installment of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000 .

" There are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is . What I wanted to point out is how this film took the largest science project in history and made it look small . The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge . Virtually all silver in the country went into making wire for electromagnetic separators . If there was every a choice between two alternative ways of doing things they just did both . The first sustained nuclear reactor was fired up under the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium with graduate students wielding axes as a scram mechanism . It 's a fascinating story involving hundreds of locations and thousands of people that this film seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico.The other thing I really disliked was the huge moral debate over if we should continue the project after Germany surrenders . Okay , we have thousands of ( mostly ) men who worked for years to make a really big boom . Does anyone think they didn 't want to see it work ? There was some controversy at the time about if we should use the device , but it was not that serious , clearly not the huge debate this film makes it out to be . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The title of this documentary is very misleading . At no time during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the Nile Perch fish into Lake Victoria has cause any of the problems facing the town of Mwanza , Tanzania . The film tries to place the problems of Tanzania on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a parasitic outside force . The documentary is very slowing paced with no narrative what so ever . Instead it relies on small blips of text between none related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand of the subject matter . There are only two attempts to discus the environmental effects of the Nile Perch fish . One is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the Nile Perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species . The film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it . The second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact the Nile Perch has introduced , and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become . The subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the Perch fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most African countries . The film tries to link the introduction of the Perch fish with AIDS , Poverty and Pollution in Tanzania but never makes a direct connection . As any intelligent person well read with problems in Africa , the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with the fish . It would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish but they don 't . The fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many . Yes things are BAD within the town of Mwanza but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter.A weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to famine problems in Tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself . First off Tanzania is a very large country and Lake Victoria is only a small portion of the country . Many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to Mwanza , the fishing town on the lake , to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country . This documentary is very weak , has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the Nile Perch . It plays on people 's emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty , famine and AIDS making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the Lake Victoria region of Tanzania or directly related to the Perch Fish . The fact is most of the problems have more to do with War , Globalization and Christianity than and environmental effect of the Perch fish itself . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is another Bollywood remake of a Hollywood movie . Hitch ... If I 'm correct.The film has some great moments which will have you laughing out loud which frankly only come from Govinda who has become a legend within Indian Cinema and will always bring his A game in terms of comedies . Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav ; who is hilarious as the gangster who mimics ' Don ' , an Indian icon of cinema . Lara Dutta is a plus ... I know I sound shallow but its mainly because I have a soft spot for her , she tries to be funny but its seems to be forced . Her acting is weak ... but she still shines . Salman Khan is atrocious , he tries to bring the cool , charming depths but fails miserably , he over acts and keeps shouting for no apparent reason .

" I just finished watching guinea pig - Devils experiment . I have to say that this movie , although having very good FX , better then I expected , was NOT a good movie . I honestly cant say that I enjoyed this movie at all . Of course It is effective in its way of being a shocking , realistic , twisted 43 minutes of torture , but I found it to be very boring ( and not as gory as i hoped ) . And also I found that the torturers were very annoying , when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time , that ruined it even more ( and Im sure there 's some people out there who will agree with me on that one ) . I have now seen guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of the flesh and blood .

" I must say I was disappointed with this film . Although it is well acted and directed , the underlying story simply plods along too slowly.Granted , in another mood I would have liked it better . I did chuckle a lot , but rarely laughed out loud ; and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won . But in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day ( one neither of us had heard of before ) this one paled in comparison.If you see lots of movies , then by all means see this -- it 's distinctly better than your average fare .

" I 'd picked this one up time and time again in the rental store , wondering if I should give it a shot . Today I broke down and gave it a whirl , and I probably shouldn 't have.While the writer / director did give the film a respectable effort , it fell far short of engaging . The characters , while you wanted to feel for them , just didn 't have enough development or depth for you to get truly involved with them . Sara 's sexual outbursts got tiring-- fast . I don 't mind sex in films , and I don 't mind bitchy characters , but being a " " bad " " girl doesn 't mean you 're prone to excitedly ask people at random if they 'd like sexual favors . By the time what happened to the characters was revealed , I was bored , and ready to fast-forward to the climax , the end , anything exciting ... and nothing delivered . The things the folks in the story eventually inform you of seems forced and unrealistic , and just wasn 't played quite right . If they 'd have thrown a bit more anguish in there , I might have been interested . This should have been a more of a suspense / drama film , and should have stuck to the title " " Jon Good 's Wife " " rather than the whole " " red right hand " " and horror film-like cover . Hell ... this should have had suspense , period.Either way ... watch this on a rainy day or a late night when there 's nothing on the television .

The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick . A guy falls down , someone gets hit by a bus , etc . None of the ideas are clever , basically the worst premise for a movie ever .

" It 's tempting to view this film as a daring avant-garde experiment . I like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of comedy film and produce something that was completely , utterly , entirely unfunny.The answer , to judge by " " From Venus " , " is a resounding ' Yes ' . This may not be the worst film I 've ever seen , but my brain seems to have repressed all memory of the others . This horrible flick hovers just on the borderline : bad enough that the thought still causes pain , but not quite so bad that my internal censors have obliterated it from my consciousness.It 's difficult for me to imagine what the director and the cast thought they were doing when they made this , or why they went ahead and released it once they 'd made it . I doubt anyone involved with it earned very much , but surely between them they could have got together enough money to buy up all the prints and have them burned.This is a movie that has nothing whatsoever to recommend it . It 's not even enjoyably bad . It 's just a non-movie in which nothing interesting happens . I gave serious thought to taking it back and demanding my money back , which is not something I 've ever done before.Don 't even think about renting ( much less buying ! ) this horrible non-movie ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I wasn 't at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit " " Hostel " , " and most of these lame ass knock-offs are just as bad or worse - yet " " Live Feed " " managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes . Started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings , followed by some good death scenes involving the Chinese Organized Crime Squad and a 7-foot , leather-aproned butcher ... What put me out of the movie was the tough ' hero ' with the guns and a grudge saving the day ... I would call this movie mediocre , at best , since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater , doubling as a hideout for the mafia , is appealing to me . If only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective , then my rating would have differed greatly . Unfortunately , most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene , leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge-type scenario . So , basically , it IS just a low-budget " " Hostel " " rip-off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex , almost constant during the first half of the film ... Overall , I would say don 't bother with this one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well , I set out with a few friends to see this movie , we went an hour before the show started to get good seats . So as you can probably imagine we where exited to see this movie : ) . But that excitement soon turned to horror , this movie is a complete failure , it just try 's to hard to be funny that its sad , the script is poorly written and relies to heavy on the actors to make up for it ... The only good acting in the whole movie was from Stefan C. Schaefer who was great , the plot was weak and even the " " funny " " scenes felt forced and unnatural , considering that the main actors are some of Iceland 's best comedians it 's well special ...

" For this movie , based off of a TV show , and a serious finale . I thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious . ' M * A * S * H Goodbye , farewell , and Amen ' was pretty good , but not this one . Unless you really love the series ( Like myself ) skip this movie.I was a loyal fan of the show Even Stevens , but the plot was too gimmicky , and Dave Coulier , man , that guy hasn 't done anything good ... well , ever .

" I like 50s sci-fi movies a lot . I like the really good ones ( such as The Day the Earth Stood Still , When Worlds Collide , Invasion of the Body Snatchers , and many others ) and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends ( such as Plan 9 From Outer Space ) . However , when a sci-fi movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun , it really should be avoided . This movie is just such a film . The posters make it appear as some sort of sexy she-beast is attacking mankind , whereas the real plot is a lot less interesting . A woman is married to a womanizer . She is contaminated and begins to grow to a HUGE size and decides to track down this worm and kick his tail and that 's about it .

It 's almost as if the writer started one story , then got another idea , and attempted to mesh the two together . Don 't waste your time on this ; believe me , you 'll be as ticked off with yourself as I was . The only actor of any note in this was James Woods , and his part was peripheral at best . I 'm all for doing stuff that is edgy , that pushes the envelopes , but this simply didn 't cut it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" FC De Kampioenen 's only reason for existence is it 's local popularity . It has caused this sitcom to run for over 15 years ( and still counting ) .It deals about an amateur soccer team with the emphasis " " amateur " . " Every storyline deals with the same subject : some misunderstanding that takes ridiculous ( and predictable ) proportions , to get resolved in the end.The show 's been running for over 15 years now , and the production probably decided not to change a winning team . Which means that the show has had minor changes over the course of years ( besides a couple of actors getting replaced ( they nearly all left by themselves rather than being thrown of the show ) ) . The humor hasn 't changed a bit over the years and it was already outdated when it first aired in the first place.I guess you have to be Flemish to get this , and over 60 years old , to enjoy such an old fashioned TV show as this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who 's a real bastard and he wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep. unfortunately , he can 't. oh yeah , and he 's haunted by the memories of his mom and dad getting eaten by a megalodon when he was a child. the guy meets some scientist whos pretty hot , and they and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character 's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents.now , the shark in this movie is a really fake looking CGI shark. basically this is sorta like Shark Attack 3 , except more depressing. if you don 't get what i mean , listen. the film 's opening credits show " " home movies " " of the main character when he was a child with his parents before they got killed , and there 's really sad and depressing piano music playing in the background. you would expect to see a shark or something , and you do. a brief shadow of the CGI shark floats around every few seconds but that 's just it. also , i don 't remember one happy facial expression at all throughout the film 's entire runtime , a majority of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss , where the story gets even more dull , and all the characters ( the shark too ) die in the end . I was thinking Sabato would manage to kill the shark and manage to save himself and the girl , but no , they all die , and the film ends with the shark , all blown up , and the submarine ( with Sabato 's crushed and burned body in it ) sinking into the abyss. if you 're a happy person and you don 't enjoy being depressed , then avoid this movie. if you 're the opposite , then congratulations , you found your movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is absurd . Absolutely terrible . Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie . The plot is totally not believable !

He manages to elude the police throughout the hospital - not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital . He takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital , blowing up the power generators and a pedestrial bridge ( why ? ) . And to top that Andy Garcia ( father of the dying boy ) and a doctor help the criminal so as to get the bone marrow . The plot is such baloney !

" To this day when you speak of the Japanese cinema , most folks won 't talk about Rashomon , or the Seven Ronin , or Ran . To the masses the Japanese cinema means all those monsters we 've grown to love destroying those Japanese cities over and over again , lots of times in battles with each other . The first and greatest of these is Godzilla who 's come back a dozen times or more and in a few films faced the three headed hydra like monster from outer space , Ghidrah.Oddly enough in keeping with the times , the special effects got slightly better . But part of the charm of those old films was seeing those paper mache city sets destroyed , they looked so phony , maybe three steps above Ed Wood.Some visitors from the future have time traveled to Japan to urge that Godzilla be destroyed from when he was first discovered . And in fact he was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during World War II when he protected the Japanese garrison on a Pacific island from those American troops . But later on with atomic testing on Bikini , Godzilla the friendly dinosaur just like Barney became the mean machine we 've grown to know in the cinema.Of course you eliminate Godzilla than you give Ghidrah a clear field to wreck Japan so it does not become the economic colossus it was by 1991 when the film came out . More I won 't say , but we all know Japan is doing reasonably well as 2010.Like all the other Japanese monster films , just sit back and enjoy the mayhem . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Intended as light entertainment , this film is indeed successful as such during its first half , but then succumbs to a rapidly foundering script that drops it down . Harry ( Judd Nelson ) , a " " reformed " " burglar , and Daphne ( Gina Gershon ) , an aspiring actress , are employed as live window mannequins at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within , whereupon they witness , from their less than protective glass observation point , an apparent homicide occurring on the street . The ostensible murderer , Miles Raymond ( Nick Mancuso ) , a local sculptor , returns the following day to observe the mannequins since he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the prior night 's violent event and , when one of the posing pair " " flinches " , " the fun begins . Daphne and Harry report their observations at a local police station , but when the detective taking a crime report remembers Harry 's criminal background , he becomes cynical . There are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed , and this one manages to utilize most of them , including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion . A low budget affair shot in Vancouver , even police procedural aspects are displayed by rote . The always capable Gershon tries to make something of her role , but Mancuso is incredibly histrionic , bizarrely so , as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein . Although the film sags into nonsense , cinematographer Glen MacPherson prefers to not follow suit , as he sets up with camera and lighting some splendidly realised compositions that a viewer may focus upon while ignoring plot holes and witless dialogue . A well-crafted score , appropriately based upon the action , is contributed by Hal Beckett . The mentioned dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and delivered well in a bantering manner by Nelson and Gershon , but in a subsequent context of flawed continuity and logic , predictability takes over . The direction reflects a lack of original ideas or point of view , and post-production flaws set the work back farther than should be expected for a basic thriller . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is about a depressed and emotionally constricted man has a distant relative move in with him in his apartment in Istanbul . As time passes , their relationship becomes more and more strained until finally he begins yelling at his house guest--who is out of work and doesn 't appear all that eager to find work . That 's most of the movie in fact . The problem is that although emotionally constricted and depressed people are VERY withdrawn and non-communicative , they don 't make for a very satisfying movie . That 's because most of the time he ( and his roomie ) just stare into space and say nothing . I think all these flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie--I certainly wouldn 't have minded . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have 2 words for you . Sean Bean . He is the only worthwhile presence in this film . But even so , don 't see this movie . Even though he is good as the main villain , you don 't want to waste your time . I didn 't care about the characters ( except the little boy ) and in fact , I didn 't really care if the star crossed lovers ended up together or died . The movie did not make me care or BELIEVE that these people cared about each other at all . I have read a lot of " " classic " " novels after seeing the movies and this movie made me not even want to read the book . The story seems so boring .

" The CinemaScope color cinematography of Leon Shamroy is quite remarkable here , including his use of colored filters forvarious scenes . The Alfred Newmann Score has to be the most sensual and seductive score Hollywood ever produced . It 's a shame it is no longer available on CD . The actors , however , never rise to the occasion . The accents are so varied , from the subdued British of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision . Tommy Rettig is jarringly American . Acting styles span the range from zombie-like to stilted . Only Ustinov as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal . The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor , seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single God , Ra - persecuted by the authorities , has its interesting points . But when the film 's plot fades , it is the haunting music and visuals that remain . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Sometimes when a film is panned by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim , well in this case it was . I believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny , I think I chuckled once when Johnny Vegas failed to vault a roadside fence and that was it.The film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living , each of them has a problem with their sex lives ; Dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a threesome a few years before , Ferris is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object , Tolly has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in his encounters and Jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman.The tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to " " I don 't believe that anybody could write that " " an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash , then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma . The blame for this all lands squarely at the feet of the writers , the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this film but I didn 't think their acting was all that bad ... not that it was all that good either . Surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic.I certainly wouldn 't recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or loathe it film , I suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Norman Wisdom 's final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings 혯 bringing his accident-prone milquetoast up-to-date , this being a product of the Swinging Sixties ! The end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the star 's typical slapstick ( and sentimentality ) with mild sexuality and even milder satire ; the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager Sally Geeson ( who doesn 't mind getting involved with him but doesn 't take their relationship all that seriously either ) ; Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson 's friend who warns Norman of her fickle character.The film is nowhere near as bad as Leonard Maltin 's BOMB rating would have it and , if anything , is interesting for its treatment of mid-life crisis ( being in many ways similar to Hoffman [ 1970 ] and 10 [ 1979 ] 혯 both of which , incidentally , I 've only just watched ) ; towards the end , Norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking !

" If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an accurate Biblical ( or Torah ) portrayal of the events in Exodus , you will be disappointed by this movie . In typical Hollywood fashion people who are not even in the Bible have been " " created " " for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie . Jethro 's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father-in-law instead of a Shepherd priest who gave Moses excellent advise . God is largely removed from the movie , and instead viewers are given the impression that Moses had to figure things out for himself . Nothing could be further from the truth.This movie is a typical Humanistic twist on Biblical things and attempts to put most of the responsibility on Moses for trying to understand what God wants and what he should do . Those who know the book of Exodus well will see not only inconsistencies in the movie , but outright glaring changes to events . Most importantly , they will see a near total absence of God 's dialog with Moses , which determines everything Moses does after the burning bush . Far from being alone as portrayed in the movie , Moses is guided by God with detailed and direct communication.Even Hallmark apparently can 't acknowledge God 's direct role , and without his spoken words to Moses many events make no sense . To compensate , Hallmark has actually changed some things . For instance , after the golden calf God plagues the people and they must look upon a symbol of a serpent to live . Hallmark creates a civil war instead and the Israelites pick sides , then slaughter each other . Moses side wins of course.There may be minimal value in this movie to unbelievers since it may cause them to seek answers , but believers should stay away . The twisted events and changes make this a danger to anyone who doesn 't know their Bible . Read Exodus for yourself , there is no substitute . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Prior to this release , Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original : " " It 's surprising how many people say it 's their favorite soundtrack . I 'm like , come on ! You may not like the new one , but if that 's your favorite soundtrack , I don 't know if I * want * you to like my film . " " Neil , a word . You might want to sit down for this too ; as Lord Summerisle says , shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent . See , Neil , the thing about the original , is that Paul Giovanni 's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it . The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical . Along with Richard and Danny Thompson , and Bert Jansch , it practically kick-started the 1970s Folk New Wave . To undermine it is akin to imagining Jaws without John Williams . Or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly . The result 's one of the most breathtakingly arrogant , pointless remake of a British cult classic since Sly Stallone 's Get Carter.The original had apparently left Nicolas Cage " " disturbed for about two weeks . " " So disturbed , during that fortnight 's window , that he pitched the idea of re-imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter-faith struggle ever devised to a writer-director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism . It 's like some parlor game : what would you get if Sam Peckinpah took on Bambi ? Or Gaspar " " Irreversible " " Noe remade Love , Actually ? ( Actually , I 'd quite like to see that ) . Unfortunately , someone took this parlor game seriously : All LaBute 's succeeded in doing is ripping out the original 's guts while saddling it with his own gormless Sex War preoccupations.After failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash , Cage 's highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor . Then he receives a letter from ex-fianc챕e Willow Woodward ( this one trades on name-homages for kudos ) , now living on the private island community of Summersisle 혯 that extra ' s ' stands for ' superfluous ' 혯 and wants Edward to help locate missing daughter Rowan.Summersisle , it transpires , is a female-dominated joint , conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the Salem witch trials . Here , the matriarchs observe the Olde ways , and the few males are near-mute breed-mules . It 's like Lilith Fair on a grand scale . Summersisle 's main export is honey 혯 a symbolic and literal headache for Edward , as he 's allergic to bees . " " Beekeepers ! " " cries Edward . " " They seem to be everywhere on this island ! " " Well , that 's probably because Summersisle 's main export is honey.While making his investigations , Edward overhears of an oncoming Mayday ritual called " " the time of death and rebirth " . " He discovers the previous year 's crop failed ; nearly dies from bee stings ; and eventually comes to the conclusion ( a conclusion which admittedly couldn 't be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands ) that Rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest . He also meets the Queen Bee of the hive , Sister Summersisle ( Burstyn ) , who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous Wicker Man : " " The drone must die . " " First , the good news : any concerns Cage would be airlifted from the Wicker Man 's flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can be laid to rest : he toast . That 's about it for the good news . " " This is a story whose chapters were carefully written " " intones Burstyn with sublime irony . Though retaining the basic cat-and-mouse premise ( and credits typography ) , what 's left subjects the original to a scorched-earth policy.Crucial to Shaffer 's original screenplay was that his Christian copper , in accordance with ritual , came to the island of his own free will 혯 and most importantly , was a virgin ; the perfect sacrifice . In reducing matters to a sexual , as opposed to a religious power-struggle , LaBute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice . By the time Cage has worked out he was the bait , you honestly couldn 't care less.And Cage is one of the very worst things in this ; a lumbering , drawling donkey 혯 an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth . " " Goddamit " " he moans after he hallucinates a drowned Rowan , with all the mental torment of a man who 's set his morning alarm clock half-an-hour too early . One hopes it 's his character 's frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state 혯 alternately fatigued , then full of preppy , overbearing vim . If so , it 's a fine portrayal of an undistinguished IQ addled with anti-depressants . If not혚it doesn 't bear thinking about . As Willow , the saucer-eyed Beahan is similarly dreadful , presenting her lines as if in competition with Cage for the혚most혚half-hearted혚delivery . While Burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince . Who 's afraid of Naomi Wolf ? Every element that made the original great 혯 the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs , the ingenious score , the dialogue ( Lord Summerisle 's majestic " " You did it beautifully ! " " has been replaced with the rather less attractive " " You did it excellently ! " " Whoah , dude ! ) 혯 have been substituted for a meandering battle-of-the-sexes thriller with occasional crash-bang wallop . Namely , walloping women ; this is a LaBute flick , after all . Cage 's Sister Beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes ; impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin ' to ' em , hyuk hyuk.The closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre clich챕 : in a bar , two guys run into a couple of Summersisle maidens on shore leave , flirty-fishing for fresh martyrs . At the moment of their successful pick-up , you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera.One more thing : keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count ( anything up to 10 ) tend to be Not Much Cop . The Wicker Man has 18 producers in total . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" What was Steven Seagal thinking ? I mean firstly I love Seagal . I love all his movies up to the mid 2000s . His early stuff is some of the best in the genre . This however does not live up to its excellent name . Attack Force ( with protagonist Marshall Lawson { Seagal } ) would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical one-liner ass kicking form . However , what we get is a crime mystery , bordering on a political thriller with little or no action . Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight . I could not follow this story . There 's people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug . What happened in this movie . The dubbing of Seagal is a disgrace , a shambles and a shame . Why dub the man ? The story is terrible .

" As usual , on IMDb , going by the majority vote instead of the " " weighted average " " is far more indicative of the movie 's entertainment value . In this case , the majority gives it a " " one " . " How right they are ! To start my review , I 'll first admit that I am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled " " Alien Intruder " . " It does involve space and even an " " alien " " ( I suppose ) , but there 's no rhyme or reason ( at all ) for anything in the long run , at least , no actual plot basis or resolution that I can make out anywhere.There are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious ( with regard to both the lines , the timing , and how they are spoken ) , that it far exceeds the weird feeling you get when watching similar really bad movies . I have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be ranting about something.The " " plot " " solely involves an area of space known as the G-Spot , sorry , make that G-Sector ... and a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien ( ? ) virus . I think it is alien since the image of the otherwise normal Ariel appears as a photographic negative.For most of the movie , we see people getting shot with space weapons , falling out of lofts , and seemingly endless , pointless close shots of " " Where 's Ariel ? " , " " " Can 't find Ariel " " ( pointless because most of the other shots INCLUDE interaction with Ariel , anyway - whatever ) on a computer monitor . Commander Skyler ( Billy Dee ) , sits and watches each fantasy of the convict 's VR programs hoping to find this Alien virus and become one with it ... ? ? ? Or maybe I missed something ... Billy Dee Williams took a few courses on " " how to act in despair " " prior to the filming of this . We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down over his face and looking mournful.The docking scene with the nose of one ship going into the rear of the other was semi-hilarious at least , and provided for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship as it is just spinning in a circle , looking much like a Lego experiment gone awry.It seems everyone dies in this movie , so why bother ? Even the VR females get killed , as if that is supposed to mean anything ( especially since everyone else dies anyway ) ... outrageous.Because of the money I save on groceries , I won 't rant about wanting my money back that I paid for the DVD of this . The dollar that I saved on that bag of vanilla wafers paid for this reviewer 's time.I 'll just add that the story itself , at least as a novel , and with far more detail added , could probably be quite interesting with the right author.1 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this . I remember feeling the same way after disliking Dogma . If you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like Mulholland Dr. , you are seen as " " not getting it . " " Of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway.I have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream-like quality it has . In other words , the plot isn 't structured like other films . With the case of Mulholland Dr. , it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to do his art project . It doesn 't make sense , it isn 't supposed to , but I know it was to be a TV series at first . It appears Lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff . You will notice that toward the end the nudity , sex and foul language increase . All things he would not have filmed for television.For a better film not told in a traditional , linear fashion , rent The Thin Red Line from 1998 . That was a great film , this is not.Rating : 2 out of ten , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

And very modern.Vivienne Osborne is a standout here also . She plays a woman with a reputation . But the character has a good heart.The print I saw was not clear . But what a joy that rare movies like this are turning up ! And they are , in some sort of watchable condition , still intact . This is nothing truly special . But if one is willing to sift through movies of its era with similarly intriguing titles , one is likely to find some suprtb movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This move is terrible . They took Gods word and made a mockery of it . The acting was terrible too . Why bother doing a story on something from the bible when your not even going to tell it correctly . There were not just a few changes but the whole thing was wrong .

" We open with Colonel Luc Deveraux ( Van Damme ) , the original Universal Soldier and his buxom Asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be Universal Soldiers . They almost kill the two , then oh wait , it was just a field test . Deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of Universal Soldiers . Why he would want to be involved in this ( if you know anything about the original ) is never explained and well beyond me.It 's after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going . The United States government has cut the Universal Soldier 's project budget and in the process angered SETH ( the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the Universal Soldiers ) . Naturally he won 't be shut down without a fight . So that means Van Damme has to go around and take all the new breed of Universal Soldiers out . Which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel , but that doesn 't stop it from becoming stupid as hell . For instance , one of the new Universal Soldiers is played by Bill Goldberg . Seems you can 't go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie . He 's big , he 's tough , right ? Wrong . Van Damme doesn 't seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him ... once ... twice ... three times . The point here lost on me . Then there 's the breaking of glass . A rudimentary part of any action movie , but someone involved must have a glass fetish . You have to see the fight scenes in particular . Let 's not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips . Then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck , they have SETH ( the computer ) secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black ( Michael Jai White ) . Nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem . Potentially offensive and just downright lame . He 's no replacement for Dolph , either.Universal Soldier 2 is a lousy sequel . It 's loud , it 's dumb and it doesn 't care . The original wasn 't anything poetic , but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level . The sequel doesn 't . They do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence . So give credit where credit is due . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller I 've ever seen . Oh .... where to start .... Plot ( what little there is ) : Clayton Beresford Jr . ( Hayden Christensen ) , a young billionaire , with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant . Clay has been secretly engaged to his mother 's PA , Samantha , played by Jessica Alba . On the night that these two secretly get married , it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found . Go and figure the odds of that one ! Once on the operating table , Clay finds out the anesthesia isn 't working , and he can feel everything and hear everything.Fortunately Clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of Samantha , which we are told he 's doing through an annoying voice-over which never seems to stop.If you didn 't burst out in laughter yet , you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes . How could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon , one nurse , an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist ? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled . Not to mention the medical behavior , which is too preposterous to be taken seriously ... the operating room isn 't even kept sterile ... people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up ... During the operation the viewer gets to hear Clay 's thoughts , none of which are too fascinating . Ah ... but here 's what it 's all about ... the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money . Believing him to be unconscious , the villains speak freely . Gosh ! What will happen ? Well ... at least there 's no interference from anyone else in the hospital , while an incompetent doctor who 's got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery . Not even Clay 's overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status . The only one interested in keeping updated is Samantha ... but oh no ... could sweet Sam be in on it .... You 'll quickly find out through some Scooby Doo dialog ... In the end , it wouldn 't even matter whether or not Clay underwent anesthesia awareness , because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases.If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness , maybe there 's some dumb fun to be had ...

" Just got back from a free screening and I 'm very glad I didn 't pay to see this very sub-par film . The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults . It seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap-stick and fart jokes though ( good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot ! ) . The movie is pretty juvenile , unintelligent , predictable , and mostly annoying . The characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all.Visually , the film is about average with nothing that really stands out . They did a decent job of mimicking the clay look from Wallace and Gromit , but other than that it 's very forgettable imagery.Although I was really bored throughout the whole film , I chuckled a couple times . It 's not an absolute failure , but I most definitely would not want to watch it again . If you 're a parent with kids ( and you don 't care that your kids see mindless cheap-jokes ) then feel free to take them to see it , but everyone else shouldn 't waste their money . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm a big fan of the old westerns , and do not believe that Hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory . But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy. fallen but virtuous woman , bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation , etc . I can 't help but notice the last names of the writer and young " " actor " " who plays Granger 's son . Any nepotism there ? I 've seen better acting in high school plays . Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills . Have I reached the 1000 words yet ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Given the budget and the inexperience of everyone involved , Livin ' tha Life could have been worse . Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker ( whom I 've always found very annoying ) , as a previous commentator has noted , but Peanut ( Edward D. Smith ) , while some of his ( over ) reactions go on way too long ( a director 's problem ) , has some comparatively subtle and funny moments , such as when he is trying to instruct Jamal on the proper method of smoking a joint with a buddy . Throughout , he is usually more poised and self-possessed than Jamal , which could have been the germ of a nice exploration of the contrasts in the relationship but wasn 't developed very far.But the inexperience of the writer / director / cinematographer / etc. is no excuse for his inattention . Has he ever seen a movie ? Faces are important ! Has he ever heard of a closeup ? Even Ed Wood could do a closeup . I don 't think it 's much of a budget issue . I could only give a general description of what any of the actors look like , and not just because of no closeups , but the lighting ... ! Lights for outdoor shooting may cost too much , but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper ! That would have required moving the camera closer to keep the reflector out of the shot , helping to solve the closeup problem at the same time . If that 's too technical you can turn the actors around so they are not in shadow , or you can expose for the shadows , and if it hadn 't been shot in L.A. I 'd say take advantage of cloudy days . It goes without saying that the movies this one steals from are all , with the possible exception of Weekend at Bernie 's , better than this one , but Livin ' tha Life would have left a much better impression if it hadn 't made the viewer squint all the way through just to catch a glimpse of whatever the human element might have been.P.S. The scene in the barbershop is just stupid . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I remember this film , exhibit in Barcelona ( Spain ) in 1970 , for the time of a week . Although it could seems incredible , and I can 't offer any explanation for it , this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to ... movies of art and big quality ( that , is , Bergman , Resnais , Malle , Bu챰uel , and ... The Projected Man ) . Few people saw it ( luckly people , no doubt ) and no reference about this very boring SF movie can be found in the Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopidie , or about the author of the original novel . Very indicative . I remember of it , after all this years , a no-story , a lot of special effects that seems ridiculous effects in fact , and no more . It seems that in some countries the running time is 90 mm. and in anothers 77 min . Well , it means only a little more of pain . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I sat down to watch this film I actually expected quite a bit , as the plot takes on quite complex issues . Using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach . Still unfortunately , despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between Muslim and western culture , adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays / lesbians , it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film . This leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle , attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with.However , this does not mean that the film is directly bad , as it 's rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing . The film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter , but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep . This has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts . By this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation.Even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama , the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when " " the ball drops " . " This way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard clich챕 that becomes ridiculous in its happy-ending . Nothing is left out in the Hollywood like ending . So even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages , one can 't help but roll eyes towards the resolution . Personally I was close to shouting " " finish already ! ! " " at the screen.There were some decent acting in the film , and the two young female central characters had some good moments . So did their parents and other bi-characters . However the handsome Irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting , that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism . He didn 't even appear very likable , but rather self involved despite his good deeds , which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained.I give the film a 4 , as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from . The script and cast had many good believable characters , giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others . Had the let-downs not been this disappointing , I 'd easily give the film a 7 or 8 . If you enjoyed this film , I 'd recommend the film " " East is East " , " which I think is an as good , if not better rendering of cultural conflict , as well as being amusing and engaging . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There are so many incorrect statements in this so-called " " documentary " " that I found myself shouting at the television.Bart Sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking DVD , but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims.He relies on either being inaccurate , not telling the full story , or the old favourite " " government always lies to us " " innuendos , and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims.What 's more , his " " exclusive " " or " " unreleased " " footage is freely available over the internet from various sites.Further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews , and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions.All of the claims made by Mr Sibrel about " " inaccuracies " , " " " mistakes " , " or " " whistleblowing " " in the Apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven.How do I get that 40-odd minutes of my life back ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man 's testicle , or look at a row of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding , or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up , then this is the movie for you . Alternating , in neck breaking fashion , between romantic and gross out comedy , Tomcats is certainly interesting . The lovely Jaime Pressly plays the wife of Horatio Sanz ( tell me another one ) who is found in many silhouetted situations with other women , but there is , surprisingly , no nudity . Jake Busey is thoroughly revolting as a hound dog who you wouldn 't want as your friend .

" Let me break down this film for you ... The first fifteen minutes are a showcase for terrible special effects . I 'm not one to nitpick about special effects , but what you 've got to understand is that if you can 't afford good special effects , you shouldn 't anchor your film around special effects . Starships fire blobs of color at each other , flaring into stock explosions , and careening past moons with polygon counts low enough to count with your fingers . You will have no idea what is happening . It will not make sense.The second act involves a woman walking in the desert . At this point you will be treated to drab scenery , and illogical , boring fight scenes . Nobody speaks . Nothing interesting happens . The protagonist 's goals are unclear , and are not very compelling . This goes on for about 45 minutes.Then in a five-minute montage , she sneaks into an enemy base , straps herself to a rocket , tries to destroy a doomsday weapon , fails , and dies.None of this has any bearing on the eventual direction of the film.In the last twenty minutes , basically the chick 's memories get transferred to her daughter , who goes into stasis for a very large number of years , learning the secrets of mankind . After this , we see the first , and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the film , then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not . You know . Because when the universe is collapsing , you get to decide if you want to be a part of it.She chooses yes . BUT THE MEMORIES OF MANKIND SURVIVE IN A CAPSULE . Maybe we won 't make the same mistakes again , huh ? If you like movies with characters , then this is not a good movie for you . The lead roles could have been fulfilled nicely by any old wind-up toy capable of staying right-side-up while walking through sand . All of the story is told through painfully dull narration.The film tries to seem deep by throwing together a whole bunch of undeveloped science-fiction ideas . There are enough concepts here to fuel a number of films , but as it stands , it 's bloated with completely irrelevant details . Two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45-second montage . Instead , the narrator fills in a novella 's worth of backstory without ever giving us a reason to care what happens to the characters.There are good ideas in here , but nobody watches films to see ideas ineptly explained . People watched films to be entertained . This film does not entertain . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm sorry , but this really does feel like a modern day Apollo 13 knock-off . Totally implausible ( at least Armageddon FELT like a comic book ! This felt like a bad High School film project ) , acting was about as clich챕 as one can get , and .... landing a space shuttle on an LA freeway ? Come on . Seriously . Jerry , what were you thinking ? And all the clich챕s : The pregnant astronaut 's wife , the nosy reporter who gets in everyone 's way , the stalwart manager with " " Go Fever " . " And it 's one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story , but at least make it GOOD ! Fact and science were totally butchered for this . The space shuttle doesn 't have fuel tanks in it 's wings , and even if it did , it couldn 't steer by shifting fuel between them ( and neither could a DC-10 ) .If you like bad acting , bad storytelling , low realism , and cheesy clich챕s , this one can 't be beat ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie . And so I sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief . Beside Ed Harris no-one seems to own the skills of acting .

Not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me.This made this movie look cheap and unreal.The story makes up a little . It is thrilling , and the plot is unexpected.Conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hood of the living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in the town of Oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets . Then one night , Rick 's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier . Desperate , Rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they 've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health . The formula hasn 't been tested on a human , or even a dead body but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life . He gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens . So Rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh . Now Rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead . Hood of the living Dead is one piece of trash . The plot is a direct rip off of Resident Evil , the acting is just horrible especially with Rick ' s fake crying for his brother , the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out , and the make up is just lame . It 's only fake blood covered over the actors face . The zombies are also modified . They run , growl , and must be shot in the heart to die ! Zombies should only scuffle , moan , and must be shot in the brain to die ! This film is so horrible , the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film . Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10 , a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Among the many accolades here for this production , there was one individual whose comments asked if he / she were the only one ( who wasn 't that enthralled by it ) - i.e. giving this film 3 stars . However , the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story , and other production of same . Well , this person isn 't the " " only one , " " who didn 't like this production ( include me ! ) but there I part company even with him / her . If you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this flick again , I 'd watch it , certainly - but I 'd probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it . I 'd much prefer being locked into solitary confinement , or having to watch paint dry on a wall , though . Further , I wouldn 't want to see this story again , anytime , anywhere , or in any alternative presentation . Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel 's " " pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo , " " and this is one of those for me . I liked Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine , " " Long Hot Summer , " " and while not a huge fan of the show , enjoyed " " Murder , She Wrote . " " But HERE -- I not only didn 't care for the story or other aspects , but I found Angela 's squealing , squawking , singing , and everything else about her over-the-top performance , perhaps the MOST ANNOYING presence in any movie ( or presentation in any other media ) I 've ever experienced . It was like an unending continuation of Audrey Hepburn 's equally " " over-the top " " Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portions of " " My Fair Lady . " " But that was incident to the plot , presented for light , comedic effect , and ( mercifully ) brief . Unmercifully , this was anything but brief , and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours ( Einstein 's layman 's explanation of " " relativity " " at work . ) If I hadn 't been with friends , with the necessity to remain , MY viewing would have been brief . I laughed , though , at the " " Seinfeld " " episode where Elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked " " The English Patient .

And that constant joke coming from the chubby lesbian about Kaye being a " " damsel in distress " " got old real fast .

" Absolutely dreadful Mexican film supposedly based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about a newsman wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works , etc ... When our hero , Gaston , is given the grand show by Dr. Maillard , head of the asylum , we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific , such as men hanging around long in a dungeon , and comedic , such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building . Then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both : a human man dressed as a chicken , yes , that 's right a chicken , that pecks around the ground for chicken feed . The scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film , but , at least for me , it was the film 's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining . Ah ! That is indeed the real horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes . And that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem . Yes , this is obvious , but some have distribution problems and others , of which this is one , have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once . This is definitely garbage . It has very little going for it . The only performer worth having a look at is Claudio Brook as the head of the asylum . He is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally , bellows orders , sashays with sword in hand , and praises the chicken . I got so tired of hearing him talk about the " " soothing system " " as his means to cure the mentally sick . What a bunch of ludicrosity ( Hey , a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word ) . It won 't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting . Cinematic chicken scratch ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" boring , horrible piece of Italian euro-trash about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time guzzling beer ( this is what makes him American , right ? Our scientists spend most of their academic life soused out of their minds , sure . That 's where all the really great theories come from ) , who 's studying something ( dolphin calls , fish migration patterns , who knows ) . He hears a weird sound through his headphones , proving that his radio is picking up a station in Jamaica . At the same time , a Jack Skellington girl with one of the worst , most bleached manes of bad 80 's hair that it has ever been my pleasure to witness is trying to calm down the dolphins in the Seaquarium she works at , as they 're apparently upset about the amount of fish she 's been doling out lately . The beginning of the film was a really badly colored storyline about two annoying , very Italian people who 's boat is attacked by something unseen under the water . The whiny woman is never seen again ( best part of the story ) , and the guys ' corpse is found with no legs . The dim , alcoholic scientist ( who has an inexplicable , English- American- Italian accent ) and the stick girl with the hay hair begin to theorize that there 's some kind of giant monster lurking under the seas off the coast of Italy ... err .. Florida.They enlist the help of an electrician to set up an underwater mike , so that the monster can sing karaoke . This guy has a beautiful girlfriend , who 's only drawback is that she pronounces Peter " " Pey-tah " , " but for some reason he 's sexually drawn to the anatomical skeleton with the frizzly hair , a situation that leaves one blinking.The dubbing is awful , the editor a spaz , and the storyline generally a yawn . There 's a bit about how this weird scientific corporation genetically engineered this monster giant shark-squid-barracuda thing for some reason that makes no sense , and a really unpleasant greasy haired guy goes around killing women , again for no apparent reason . A stupid sheriff and his bulked up deputy are along for the ride , along with a female scientist ( who we know is smart because she wears huge glasses ) . At one time the woman scientist takes on the huge , terrible monster ( yeah , right , Ed Wood 's giant octopus was more believable ) with only a small handaxe , and she wins the contest . Hooray for skinny little women , who obviously make the best monster hunters ! The solution to the problem of the giant thing is to blow up half of the Everglades , leaving a dead zone for several miles in every direction . To Hell with ecology and the environment , right ? We have to kill this giant monster ! At the end , the electrician and his broomstick love ride off into the sunset on her Vespa , which is o.k. since she 's gotten over her colleagues ' death and he 's not very upset that his girlfriend got whacked by the crazy guy with the greasy hair . Hooray for true love ! Wait a minute , isn 't there something fishy about all this ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really felt cheated after seeing this picture . It felt like I sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing . I don 't understand what they were thinking when they made this . It hardly gets into Jeffrey Dahmer murdering and it has no ending . It felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel . It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos . It ends suddenly , and you know there 's going to be another episode next week . It also felt like I just watched part 1 to a two part movie . There are many possibilities for what went wrong here ; they got lazy , they ran out of money , they didn 't know the rest of the story , they wanted to make a Dahmer 2 . After seeing this movie they all sound very accurate . I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods . All of a sudden I hear this music playing , then writing comes on the screen and says how Dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34 . Wow , he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail . How about showing how he got there . How about showing Dahmer 's trial . How about showing some more detail . I can 't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place . I actually found myself saying in disbelief , " " That 's it , that 's the end ?

If there was a plot , it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes , there 's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing .

" They must be . I 'll list them so that you can check them off one-by-one : - Police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars of cash and drugs just lying around , because they don 't have evidence facilities.- When you get shot , you always grunt the same way , and fly back the same way , even though there 's never a mark on your body.- Police are not able to identify the sound of gun shots , and don 't think anything is suspicious when an undercover policewoman 's phone call during a high-level drug-and-money deal is cut shot by that gun shot.- Bad guy gunmen can hit mannequins with one shot , but can 't hit a big , bulky martial artist with 100.- If you rocket launcher a car in a car park , the next three cars in a line will blow up evenly in 15 second intervals.- Further to the last point , all the cheap cars are always parked next to each other.- The smoke that is caused from the firing of the rocket launcher is much greater than the amount of smoke caused by four cars blowing up.- Virtual reality games that are a long , long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce fit on five floppy disks.- Virtual reality games that are a long , long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce have graphics that look like Windows 3.1 screen-savers.- Floppy disks can be read even after they 've been shot up.- Semi-drunk guys in bars attentively watch the news when they 're at the pub , and have a deep understanding of American modern military history , Agent Orange , and the family trees of high-ranking military officials . However , they 're only able to articulate their points using dialogue that sounds silly coming from anyone over the age of seven.- Even though fights appear to break out almost hourly in a bar , that bar has only one staff worker , who both pours the beers and handles security .

" The plot has already been described by other reviewers , so I will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undoubted glory.Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest , prettiest examples of " " posh totty " " to have been committed to celluloid . Of her era and ilk , only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close . What was it about actresses with musical brothers ? ( Nick Drake and Peter Asher ) For those who like me have admired Gabrielle , her scenes in this movie will not disappoint . She has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here.As a whole , the movie is very poor and being of its time , very cheaply made .

" Normally I 'm quite disposed to like low budget gonzo films , but Darkman III is so appallingly unengaging that I feel nothing but contempt for it.It looks and feels like a TV show , and a particularly shoddy one at that . The sets are sparse , the lighting flat , the score and effects disjointed , and the camerawork is film school 101 . There 's no plot to speak of , the characters are one dimensional , and the actors are sleepwalking . Most of the cast look like they should be doing soft core porn ..... In fact , the only reward that I got from this mess was spotting the startling squint faced Roxann Biggs-Dawson ( B 'Elanna from Star Trek : Voyager ) without her Klingon bumpy head makeup on .

" * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * HERE ON EARTH / ( 2000 ) 1 / 2 * ( out of four ) Mark Piznarski 's " " Here on Earth " " holds the record for a movie containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes . Literally every contrivance , clich챕 , and familiar plot element are somewhere in here ; there is simply nothing unique , original , or fresh about it . God , what an agonizing motion picture to sit through ; I wish I saw the film during its theatrical release last year so it could have earned on my year 's worst list . This is the kind of movie where the story makes itself instantly obvious , and goes downhill from the opening credits , and worst of all , takes itself seriously . " " Here on Earth " " is clearly one of the most horrible , painful movies to come down the pike in some time . " " Here on Earth " " is a teen heartthrob film , so it must contain some of Hollywood 's most prized young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie as bad as this . Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett fit that vary description , and take the lead roles by storm . Klein plays Kelley , an arrogant and insolent student with a wealthy father ( clich챕 number one ) . He is to graduate as the valedictorian and attend Ivy league college following in the footsteps of his father ( Stuart Wilson ) . This sets up the " " I don 't want your life , " " clich챕 in which the father tries to control his son 's life , while the son resists rebelliously . Throw in Kelley 's deceased mother who committed suicide a while back . When his father brings home another woman , he brutally questions his intentions ( the " " no one can replace mom " " clich챕 counts as number two ) .Josh Hartnett plays Jasper , a character on the opposite side of society to Kelley . His family owns a local diner . Enter his long-time love interest , Samantha Cavanaugh ( Leelee Sobieski ) a waitress at the diner who covers for her sister ( who has no purpose whatsoever rather than controlling the following scene ) when Jasper and Kelley act like childish morons by racing their cars and ( oh no ) crashing into the diner , causing it to erupt into flames . ( Conflicts between the rich and poor will count as clich챕 number three . ) The bungled car chase sets both Kelley and Jasper up for a contrived and plausible conflict . They get in trouble with the law , but because this movie feels the need to exist , the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time : they must work together to help rebuild the diner.The two boys work hard during the summer growing strong and getting a nice tan . Samantha 's eye catches Kelley , and romantic sparks fly . Jasper is jealous , but wants what is best for his true love ( clich챕 number four ) . Her parents ( Annette O 'Toole and Bruce Greenwood ) disapprove of her little romantic triangle ( clich챕 number five ) , but she continues two timing Jasper without a second thought . Her father also happens to be the local sheriff , how surprising ( lets count that melodramatic nugget clich챕 number six ) .The contrived romantic feelings between Kelley and Samantha count as clich챕 number seven . But Samantha 's relationship with Jasper is never defined , so how can there any romantic tension ? If the film is going to induce involvement in Samantha 's choice between the two young men , then we need to see both characters from both sides . The movie depicts Jasper as a distraction to her " " rightful love , " " Kelley . It 's clear Jasper truly loves her , but it is also clear she does not love him back . This absolutely slaughters the romantic tension early in the story.Leelee Sobieski does no harm here ; however , her charm and kind performance do not fit a two-timing character like Samantha . John Hartnett is also right for the role of Jasper , but the movie gives him nothing to do except bicker with Kelley . Chris Klein gets to make a hunk name for himself here ; he spends much of the movie shirtless , sweaty and overworked . Unfortunately he does not show off his acting ability , maybe because he has very little . The supporting cast is much more talented . Bruce Greenwood supplies the best performance in the film , but does not have near enough screen time to save anything but a few brief moments . I also enjoyed the performance by Stuart Wilson , who perfectly fits the role of a rich , controlling father of high social status.Then we lean about Samantha 's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie ( another spoiler ahead ) . What is this , she has a serious incurable illness ( yet another contrivance into the picture , approximately number eight ) . Her terminal disease brings the two competing young men together as friends , well , at least I think that is what the movie intended to show , that the loss of one loved by two nemeses can bring both together ( clich챕 number nine ) .Klein rehearses his valedictorian speech to demonstrate his character is more than a shallow stereotype , but we have seen this so many times before I would prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental who hides actual feelings ( clich챕 number , um , was it ten ) ? . The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and inane ; a " " your mom " " comment triggers a fist fight while they rebuild the establishment . There is a retread from " " Armageddon , " " as Samantha and Kelley sprawl out in an open field , horny as hell , as he slowly moves his fingers around her body , naming areas after US cities ( why not call that number eleven ) . The movie uses alcohol as a means to increase the romantic tension : an intoxicated Kelley makes a fool of himself after getting in a fight with Samantha 's date , Jasper , but the following day he recites desires only to dance ( clich챕 number , oh no , I am losing count ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Like the previous two ' Mad Max ' films , ' Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ' is not exception to the violence and strange plot . Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to ' tomorrow morrow land ' . This is generally a warped film with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner , methane-pigs , and odd characters . I got very bored by watching it all , and it offered nothing to me . I did not feel inspired after watching this film ; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film .

" Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals , this movie is not for everyone.The story is very similar to other movies , in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age , and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family . She does that by choosing some kind of sport , and with the help of a local boy , that for some reason falls in love with her , she confronts her problems and wins.In Girlfight it 's boxing , in Bend it like Beckham it 's soccer , and now it 's Kung Fu.But Fighter is much inferior product than these two , it was simply embarrassing to watch it . Semra Turan , the " " actress " " that playing the role of a teenage girl , maybe can do a lot of things , but one thing she can 't do is to act . Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy , the dramatic situations , in which she tries to show some emotions , are dreadful , her body and facial language are of amateur actress , badly instructed by the director . The rest of the cast is a little better , but they just cannot save this clich챕 movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot . Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer.Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this , it 's just so boring . The slow motion was really unnecessary , the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration , and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions , not actually fighting . Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys , and knocks them off their feet . The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it 's European . It 's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from Denmark , but don 't be fooled , it 's not . It 's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems , which are , by the way , not really convincing.Bad movie with embarrassing lines , acting and story . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Should you wish to see the worst film ever made , look no further . Some wretched movies are watchable because they are unintentionally funny .

" I saw this " " hot " " movie when it came out in 1986 . It had a X rating for a brief scene involving oral sex but played in mainstream theatres ( it was an " " art " " film ) . Supposedly it 's the first film to ever show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene.What I saw was a boring tale about a high school boy ( Federico Pitzalis ) in love ( understandably ) with an older woman ( Maruschka Detmers ) . As has been mentioned before Detmers is very beautiful with a good body BUT she also gave a very good performance . Pitzalis was ( to put it mildly ) pretty poor . It 's no wonder he never made another movie . Still , despite the infamous sex scene ( which is explicit but pretty brief ) , this a slow moving dull story which bored me silly . The good acting by Detmers only helped to a certain point . Mostly I was looking at my watch waiting patiently for it to end . If it didn 't have that sequence this movie would have been forgotten long ago . Dull and slow . You can skip this one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Certainly not horrible , but definitely not good.Cry , The Beloved Country ( 1995 ) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood ( Adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton ) . Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris.The film is about pre-Apartheid South Africa , and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining . The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo ( James Earl Jones ) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying that he must come immediately ; he later finds that his son has killed a man . The rich farmer / landowner James Jarvis ( Richard Harris ) finds that his son , a fighter for black rights , was the one killed by Kumalo 's son . In this they connect.I cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name , for I have not seen it . Or the 1974 musical titled Lost in the Stars for I have also not seen it ; both look better than this one . But Cry Freedom , on the other hand , I have seen ; it has a much more urgent air to it , like it actually is trying to say something where the film Cry , The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it is going . Very " " Wishy-washy " . " I refuse to compare the film to the novel ( except that I did enjoy the novel more than I enjoyed the film ) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means.Frankly , this movie blew . Well , I guess it wasn 't that bad , --Five-out-of-ten , -- but it wasn 't that good either . Both of the leads , both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances I have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history ( but that can be blamed on he screenwriter , Ronald Harwood , who is also oddly off is game with this film , having also written the sublime The Pianist , and Being Julia ) . Among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time ; there is little , if any , tension with any moment of the film , racially or suspensefully . The music doesn 't help . The painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film . One upside is the cinematography , with many rather good or great shots , but unfortunately , this does not help the film too much.The last , striking words of Alan Paton 's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film . It is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown . I don 't know what Nelson Mandela might have seen in this film.Thanks for your time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The first 2 / 3 of this film wasn 't that dissimilar to the American mummy films of the 30s and 40s . Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die . One became an Aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love . And the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her . So far , it 's all the typical mummy film ... though it 's quite a bit slower and duller than the American versions . Oh , and of course the Aztec mummy looked really , really crappy.However , into this standard but boring film there is a super-villain . Why ? I dunno--it sure didn 't make any sense to have one . It seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the Aztec treasure is buried . Why does he need the treasure ? Well , to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots , dummy ! But first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy , as the mummy has so far been unstoppable.You 've got to see these " " human-robots " " as they look like the enormous clunky robots from Flash Gordon and other serials BUT they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside ! They really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie . Both battle in super-slow-motion like they are bathed in taffy ... and it 's done in such an artless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chuckles--certainly not thrills.Overall , the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled mess--especially at the end . However , for bad movie fans , it 's a must-see--it 's bad but unintentionally funny and great to watch and laugh at with friends . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I admit to liking a lot of the so-called " " frat-pack " " movies . No matter how bad they are , I can find something to like about Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell or Jack Black . But " " Envy " " just left me about as cold as the white horse that Ben disposed of . This time , it 's Ben and Jack Black as a couple of nutty neighbors , one of whom ( Black ) discovers a aerosol spray to make animal poop disappear and becomes incredibly wealthy while the other ( Stiller ) writhes in envy . That 's supposedly the plot , but then it veers off in other directions that don 't really make much sense.I guess the ' Vapoorize ' thing is sort of amusing at first . The problem is , they try to sustain the gag for the whole picture ( Black has a license plate that reads ' Caca King ' ) and it gets fairly tiresome . But even Ben and Jack are used poorly ; the energy level for both of their performances seems significantly dialed down . The two best performances by far are Rachel Weisz and Chris Walken . Walken 's neo-hippie-dippie guy is so offbeat and so well-modulated a performance that it really never suggests any of Walken 's other familiar nutcase characters . It 's completely unique , yet comes across as unmistakably Walken . And Weisz is about the best actress in the business that nobody knows about . Even with limited screen time , she still dominates every scene she 's in.The whole crux of the so-called drama is that Ben , in a jealous drunken stupor , accidentally shoots Jack 's prize white stallion , and then goes to ridiculous lengths to cover it up , fearing his best friend will find out and cut him dead . But the plot twist isn 't believable because there 's nothing about Jack 's character to indicate that he would do such a thing . He plays such a sweet guy that it renders the whole excruciating horse chase null and void . You discount it completely . It 's all filler . And what 's the point of the out-of-control merry-go-round , except that Barry Levinson wants us to know that he 's seen " " Strangers on a Train " " ? The screenplay is painfully bad and the acting of the two leads poorly directed . Someone with Levinson 's track record should know better . Maybe someone will invent something to make this film disappear . Oh , wait , they already have . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ( As a note , I 'd like to say that I saw this movie at my annual church camp , where the entire youth group laughed at it . I bought it when I saw it on a shelf one year later , if only for the humor I derived from a bad attempt at making an evangelical movie . ) Lay it Down falls short of many movie fans ' expectations on several different planes . Most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting . Regardless of the nice cars in the film , or the truth in Christ 's sacrifice for you , as a movie AND witnessing tool , Lay it Down hardly delivers . Most good opinions of the movies are supported by Christians agreeing with the message . While it 's easy for a Christian to agree with the points delivered , the audience hardly ever witnesses life outside a clich챕 . The fighting scene between Ben and his brother is horribly dubbed . And there are at least three blatant typos in the subtitles.I encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director 's commentary on . It really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was . The director 's views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a movie-goer 's needs : he shows a pedantic understanding of Nonchristians , as well as some points of religious conflict ; most of the editing , he admits , was rushed , but " " satisfactory " " ; he thought the over-used transitions and themes to be effective ; and was completely happy with the acting . He also inserted motifs that he was rather proud of : -All ( read : most ) of the names are significant . Ben Destin = " " Been Destined " , " Gus Pelman = " " Gospel Man " , " Nicky D = Nicodemus . -The car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without Christ . -When Ben leaves on Pete 's motorcycle , he crosses his crutches to form a " " cross " . " I 'm not making any of those up . He throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like " " blow their brains out with guns " , " and how " " God is in control when your born and when your die " . " Yes , that was not a typo . He really says that.I have ( little ) forgiveness reserved for this movie . The " " cool cars " " and " " good message " " don 't do jack to make this movie good . However , the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than 1 / 100th of " " The Fast and the Furious 's " , " and the time limit was unforgiving . With that in mind , I give it a score of 2 / 10 , instead of the 1 / 10 I so dearly think it deserves . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

His scene with Candy ( doing a Z-grade Dom DeLuise ) was torture . Speaking of torture , five minutes of the talentless Shepherd , and I bet the prisoners at Gitmo would crack like walnuts !

" Owen ( David Krumholtz ) and Chloe ( Denise Richards ) are a youngish couple living in Manhattan . Owen is a moderately successful magazine writer while Chloe is an aspiring actress . Happily for her , Chloe gets big role on a sitcom and temporarily moves to Hollywood . Missing her , Owen books a flight to LaLa Land , as a surprise . When he arrives at her set trailer , however , the " " house " " is shaking , as Chloe and her hunky co-star are having a little romantic tryst . The writer and the actress are through . Hurt and mad as a hatter , Owen goes back to NYC . Sympathetic friends decide to set him up on a blind date with Nadine ( Milla Jovovich ) to get him out of his sulky funk . But , it goes badly , as the duo mix like oil and water , mostly due to each having a strong personality and Owen 's huge shoulder chip . Yet , over the next few months , astonishingly , Nadine and Owen become pals , who confide in each other and hang out . Can it turn into something more ? Well , who the heck cares ! This film is so STUPID that most folks will yank it out of the DVD player after the first ten minutes . The script is pathetic , dismal , and , oh , stupid , too . Then again , Krumholtz gives a very obnoxious and offensive performance as well . Jovovich is not much better but who could look good with the lines she has to spout ? William Baldwin , too , reaches a career low with his crude and sex-crazy role as Owen 's brother . The only cast member who is any good is Richards but she must cringe when she looks back at this one . Okay , the costumes and production values are adequate . Then , too , there is ONE clever element in that , occasionally , the characters will speak their lines but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads with the words of what they are truly thinking .

" I read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot . I 'm an open minded guy after all and I ? 셶e given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks . As the end credits rolled on this one I searched for meaning and something nice to say . Here goes : " " This film was mercifully short . " " That 's all I got.Okay , Okay . The sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits . I did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd.By the time of the " " chicken dance " " at the finale I had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall . I don 't know what could have salvaged this film . The acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasn 't any way to make it watchable ; not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts .

" Why did I buy this movie on DVD ? , Well the short answer would be : I really don 't know . As for the longer version , it pretty much comes down to the fact that I genuinely like Tatyana Ali and she plays Alicia in this.Now does Tatyana Ali give a genuinely good effort in this movie ? I must say that it is one of the better , and she is shaping up to be a rather decent actress . I am very much looking forward to see her in action , when better material will be available.This being said , this movie was terrible - and my score is given based on this : 1 star for not being the worst movie I 've seen , 1 star for the performance of Tatyana Ali , and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars , there are worse movies for that.Ja Rule should stick to rapping , not my favourite rapper to say the least , but some seem to like him - and if he is contained there , I would be delighted not to see him contaminate the acting scene.Ving Rhames : Ah man , Marcellus Wallace what are you doing here - you used to be cool man . Just because Michael Caine is a fiercely brilliant actor , who has been in so many terrible flicks as well as good , you don 't have to copy him Ving.The rest of the semi big names in the cast : It 's OK , there are bills to be paid , and we all have to do things we 're not proud of time to time.The movie itself . It so massively flawed , it 's pretty difficult to know where to start . It 's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together , as were the director to say " " we need to tell this , and we need to tell that " .

To say the least , the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore predictable what was going to happen all the time.To sum up in one word : Reallynotgood , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

However , this is still the dumbest movie ever made , destined to be introduced by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer , if it hasn 't been already . A bit of trivia , Illinois doesn 't even have parole hearings , and Dixon Prison is a medium security facility housing burglars and vending machine vandals . The classic clucking / seduction scene is perhaps the most amusing piece of writing I 've ever seen , especially with the suspenseful build-up , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I usually come on this website prior to going to the movies , as I like to see what other people think of the movie . I read many reviews which said ' thriller not a horror movie ' . This prompted me to give this film a try . I really must take issue with these ' thriller / horror ' statements , as it was neither ! I almost went and asked for my money back , and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbish .... well you must be easily pleased ! At the end of the movie , the people behind me said out loud " " what a waste of time " " and I turned to them and replied " " I couldn 't have summed it up better " . " I kept waiting for something to happen ... but it didn 't . There was the potential for a lot of good scares ( or thrills if you like ) but none happened . Williams acted the part quite well but I felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere . Save your money folks , this is a turkey which will be featuring at a DVD store ' bargain box ' near you in the very foreseeable future ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
... " Said the continuity announcer as TACTICAL ASSAULT was about to be broadcast . After seeing the first two minutes I started thinking Rutger might want to get a new agent . After seeing the next ten minutes I started thinking Rutger might want to retire thereby saving a potential audience from any more of his performances Yup this is a truly terrible movie . I wasn 't expecting much and why should I if the name Rutget Hauer appeared in the credits , but within seconds of the opening title credits that featured NATO warplanes with USSR markings bombing Bosnia I realised I was going to be force fed inedible turkey three months after Christmas .The attention to detail is non existent . NATO planes carry USSR markings then were told Hauer 's character spent six years in an Iraqi prison which would make the setting 1997 . What NATO were bombing the Serbs in 1997 ! I guess the producers didn 't think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy but I know I did . The producers also probably hoped the audience wouldn 't notice the lack of continuity such as dogfights with Iraqi jets that suddenly turned from Migs to F-4 Phantoms then back again but I did . Even stranger characters would take off in F-16s then when they arrive back at base there jet has changed into a Soviet built Mig Oh and if you 're expecting a dumb action movie you 're only half right because it 's dumb but most of the plot centres around a BASIC INSTINCT revenge plot . I 'll give the producers some credit ( Maybe credit is too strong a word ) because after seeing plots featuring nannies from hell , policemen from hell , flat mates from hell we now have a fighter pilot from hell which means every single occupation of the 20th century has featured in a from hell type plot with perhaps TATICAL ASSUALT being the worst movie of the lot , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am usually a big fan of Pacino ( Scarface , Serpico , Devils advocate ) but since Scent of a woman he pretty much plays the same role and shouts a lot . This movie had no endearing characters to warm to . Brandon played by Bongo McConnahey is the least likable of the bunch . He nowhere even approached a real human being . Pacino was hopelessly unlikeable and my goodness how old is Renee Russo ? The only high light of this wretched mess was the hot hooker with the perfect lipstick and she has like 10 lines total . Even the usually reliable Jeremy Piven was utterly unlikeable.Note to writers of movies , they do not usually work unless one of the main characters is at least a bit likable ( noteable exception Scarface ) . As the movie closes and old Brandon is at the airport my only thought was , please let a plane crash into the airport and kill Brandon . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Oh , this is so bad , it is funny . The only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun . I mean : you get to see porn actresses topless , having sex , then killed by human mutants . There is plenty of gore , including the classic " " something is wrong with her , oh no , it 's half the person she used to be " " and the accidental murder caused by panic . But you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someone 's ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees ( that makes a metallic doiiing sound afterward , like in cartoons ) . Somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn , they really need to know what 's inside an actress , mere genitals are not enough . Therefore you get to see plenty of summary autopsies on slain bimbos . There is NO dialog . Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when accepting a role here . I think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy stuff , just to be reminded of the old school C class horror movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was promising : my favorite actor in a historical drama during the Independence war . It had memories from " " Dances With Wolves " " for the big prairies , Indians , military fights & from " " Barry Lyndon " " for the British & candles lights atmospheres ... Unfortunately , the script is awful : the continuity of the story is lacking ( cuts with " " 5 months later " " ; " " 3 years later " " ) & the romance is so ridiculous that it 's hard to believe in it : America is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other ; Above all , wait for the ending & you understand how to kill a story ( imagine the same in " " Titanic " " ) .Sometimes , a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker . Unfortunately bis , Hudson is a poor one . He has already committed " " Greystoke " " and i find again the same flaws : no dynamic in scenes , in editing , in scoring : it is long , dull , flat .... I knew that this movie was a disaster for Pacino 's career : now i understand . Finally , this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me : A painful one ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Of all the adaptations of books by Alistair MacLean , I feel that this qualifies as the worst , but don쨈t blame MacLean ! . It would appear that all that this film shares with the novel is the same title . We have no suspense , no sense of foreboding of mystery , no chance to really empathize with the main characters . We spend the entire duration ( or at least I did ) waiting for Charlotte Rampling to shed her clothing ( for Charlotte , this appears to take a remarkably long time ! ) . Still , a glimpse of Charlotte Rampling쨈s tits really can쨈t save this disastrous film . MacLean has once again been kicked into the gutter to endure the sniping of those bitter hacks and nit-pickers who would appear to blame him for all the ills that befall attempted filming of his books . Poor old Alistair must have crawled into a corner and whimpered when this one came out . At least " " Bear Island " " - which also uses the Maclean name but apparently none of his novel - was a LITTLE exciting . The excitement here is in waiting for the final credits . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The most generic , surface-level biography you could hope for . Busey 's impersonation of Holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear Gary Busey sing " " Maybe Baby " " ? Typically , the members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama ( Smith and Stroud , respectively ) instead of as people or even characters . When Holly uses a string section , the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him he 's using the same techniques as Mozart . It 's just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this ( and " " Amadeus " , " about the aforementioned Mozart ) so worthless . Some entertainment can be derived from Holly 's excellent styles and songs done in a B-variation . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yes , we all know about Dan Schneider 's odd little fascination with making shows with young kids and iCarly is no exception . See young girls wiggle their toes and stick their tongues out for the camera and wear skimpy clothes and bikini 's . Yes , it makes you wonder if these shows were made for teens or for some older degenerate crowd . Either way the show isn 't that good when compared to Dan Schneiders other shows like the far superior Amanda Show & Drake and Josh.The show is about a brother and sister ( Carly and Spencer ) living alone and having to get by on their own while their father is off in the Army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives . Carly has a mean spirited friend named Sam and they do a very well produced , award winning web show called iCarly with their little school friend Freddie . The episodes deal with their lives in and around the web show and their hi jinx at school.Carly Shay is a young , all knowing web personality / business woman / producer played by Miranda Cosgrove , a young actress who relies on talking very very loudly and fast to get her point across and making odd faces . Her brother Spencer is a somewhat mean-spirited , dim-wit and eccentric artist played by Jerry Trainor , who tries a bit to hard to be like Jim Carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at the young male audience who 'd like this type of Joey Gladstone humor . Then there 's Sam Puckett , an unlikable , mean little , lying thief of a brat who needs an attitude adjustment played by Jeanette McCurdy who clearly wears hair extensions as you can see them disappear then reappear from scene to scene . And finally there 's Freddie Benson the web shows nerdy cameraman and technical adviser , who has a major crush on Carly but will obviously get nowhere with her who 's played by Nathan Kress.Other secondary characters come and go such as Freddies mother , Carly 's grandfather , annoying teachers and many of their annoying little school friends to round out the cast . Most of the comedy is mean spirited , like blowing up Lewbert the Doorman as a gag , throwing a water balloon at a teacher and knocking over the table of young girl scouts selling cookies . All of the adults come off as complete idiots while the children are all knowing , and certain main characters have absolutely no morals . Lying , cheating , stealing and violence all are acceptable in this children 's show created and written by Dan Schneider , Yes ... it 's a children 's show ! What more could the young viewers ask for ? ? Well , with Dan Schneider we can expect to have the young girls dress in tight clothes and bikini 's and do some odd things like sticking their tongues out for the camera and eating banana 's.Shows like this are just what the young crowd likes though and I guess no worse then any of the other garbage Nick shovels at its young crowd . There 's always fans to be found for anything seen on TV , at least this is a bit better then most of the stuff seen on Nick like that horrible Naked Brothers show . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" On the face of it , Ruiz has set out to make a psychological thriller . Although it 's not as satisfying as a classic piece in that genre , there are compensations . The tensions generated between Huppert and Balibar as women calmly but calculatingly at war over a boy they both claim are compelling ; however , in a true European art-house style , Ruiz doesn 't give us release of this tension as the women alternately also try to behave compassionately towards each other . The only raised voice is that of Huppert 's waking from a nightmare ( an uncontested irrational event in the film ) .In fact , if we follow the title , the film is as little about its thriller skeleton as Jane Campion 's In The Cut . Instead it is an intergender psychological study focusing on men . The boy , Camille ( Nils Hugon ) , decides on a practical joke , playing his mother off against an emotionally vulnerable other woman . Both women seem to pander to him rather than scold and this compounds the problem . In the background is an intemperate psychologist ( Charles Berling ) , swift to confront the women in his life - his sister Huppert , the nanny or his pa - and so acting as a symbolic adult counterbalance to the , calm and ( we learn ) manipulative Camille . It is particularly interesting that , like the father in Henry James ' The Turn of The Screw , Denis Podalydes ' law-enforcer Father is absent for the duration of the film . Ruiz fashions an Oedipal moment out of Huppert 's reaction to his return at the film 's close.Read either as a thriller or as a psychiatric essay , this film is ultimately rather disappointing . I 'm officially rather fed up with Mme Huppert 's screen method , which is too buried and so I 'll be looking to see her on stage before I come back to her ( European - enjoyed Heaven 's Gate ) films again . The support is good . Ruiz does the cast no favours though . Quite apart from some poor lighting and some wilfully odd shots , its as if his direction has left characterisation quite out of reach - I 'm thinking particularly of Edith Scob 's Shamanic neighbour to Isabelle , who acts knowing but communicates bafflement . The set pieces do not link up to a forward driving plot - the tension I have already referred to is not only weakly dissipated but wasted in its directional potential.Want to see a good contemporary French thriller ?

" There isn 't much about " " Reckless " " that feels right , beginning with the off-putting title ( thanks to screenwriter Craig Lucas , who adapted his own play , bringing the title along with him ) and continuing with the casting ( Mia Farrow playing wife to Tony Goldwyn , who 's young enough to be her son ) . The couple live in an idyllic winter world that appears to be the inside of a snow-globe , but Farrow gets a startling dose of reality after he admits he 's hired a man to kill her . She flees into the night , taking refuge with a very strange couple who want to help her rebuild her life . The production design and art direction of " " Reckless " " are fine , but they are services rendered for a completely inane , often alienating screenplay . It 's supposed to be a dark holiday comedy , though the cast is at a loss with this unfunny , occasionally offensive material . * 1 / 2 from * * * * , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" 1st watched 12 / 26 / 2008 - ( Dir-Eugene Levy ) : Corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs . The movie appears to be based on an earlier Italian movie according to the credits but was re-written by two fairly popular American romantic comedy writers . But this one by Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts . The story is about a couple of down-and-out traveling Americans , played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young , who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund 's return . Upon trying to return it , they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady 's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money . They freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder . The other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a Monte Carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story . The other cast members include character actors John Candy , James Belushi , Cybill Shepherd , George Hamilton and others . After the police find out about the death , they start questioning the main characters and , of course , they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened . None of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it 's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the Belushi / Shepherd couple . This isn 't a horrible movie , it just isn 't that good . There are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile . Try it , maybe you 'll like it , probably you won 't . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was really looking forward to watching this film . It had all the ingredients of a great tongue in cheeker , but it just didn 't come together AT ALL . Kevin Spacey 's accent was tolerable except that sometimes he forgot to use it and I would rather NOT have had to listen to Linda Fiorentino 's pale attempt . She and Helen Baxendale were totally lacking in charm and personality , thankfully their screen kids had loads , so you could find at least some members of his 2 families endearing . You could have strained spaghetti with the plot and I 'm sure that the script was written by some adolescent schoolboy in a high school English competition . That said , when I wasn 't cringing , I was smirking so it wasn 't a totally wasted 90 minutes . I did find the superimposing of Kevin 's face on the painting very clever and quite funny . Maybe I 'm being a bit harsh but I was expecting a bit of quality viewing and it just never came . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There is nothing I hate more in a movie than pretentiousness , and this is one of the most pretentious films ever made . It 's self-consciousness is obvious in every frame : " " see what a profound , sophisticated film we are making , " " the director and screenwriters seem to be saying to us , and to themselves they say , " " lets 's see how we can bore and confuse the audience even more . " " I would rather watch the worst film by Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer than something like this . At least they were giving us honest trash , and at least their films , in their own atrocious way , were entertaining . This film is about as entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia , and thus is tantamount to torture.Have these screenwriters ever heard the word ' story ? ' It doesn 't appear so . They have a concept , they are able to create an atmosphere , and they were able to assemble an excellent cast and elicit good performances from them . And for what ? To bore us for an hour and 45 minutes ? Nothing really happens in this film . The only exciting part , and this lasts only about two minutes , occurs when one of the soon-to-be-evicted homeowners starts shooting at the state employees who come to tell him he has to leave . But nothing comes of it . Too bad he didn 't keep shooting until he hit the screenwriters . The only redeeming features of this film are the acting and some beautifully photographed scenery toward the end . 3 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " The Bone Snatcher " " starts out extremely promising , with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the African desert . Whilst checking pipelines out in the desert , three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that devours their flesh and only leaves a pile of half-eaten bones . The expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a superiorly mutated ant-queen , and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well . Director Jason Wulfsohn sustains a respectable level of tension just until the nature of the monster is identified . Immediately after that , the film rapidly turns into an ordinary creature-feature with all the characters dropping out of the survival-race one by one . The second half of " " The Bone Snatcher " " is unendurably boring ; with the inevitable love-story clich챕s as well as a complete absence of gory murder set pieces . The characters all are insufferable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance . There 's the rookie who has to prove himself , the female with brain-capacity apart from her hot looks , the obnoxious experienced guy who redeems himself at the end through self-sacrifice and 혯 last but not least 혯 who could forget the wise black guy who refers to the monster using all kind of voodoo names . Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space menaces of " " Alien " " and " " Predator " . " The ant-creature has infrared-vision and crumbles when shot at , yawn ! The movie actually just benefits from its unique setting and the handful of nasty images of decomposed bodies . This could have been a modest gem , but instead it 's less than mediocre .

" Everybody I talked to said that this movie would be good and really weird so I figured that I would rent it . Half way through the movie I was thinking to myself what the heck was going on and what is the point to this movie . This movie from start to finish is so bad that even the sick parts of the movie didn 't even bother me . I mean what are they going to come up with next Volcano 2 The return of the lava . I mean come on this movie is so stupid the characters are so poorly developed , and eve Robert Englund makes the movie worse I mean he might as well be transformed into Freddy Kruegur and Spook people . I was actually rooting for the bad guy to win that 's how bad it was . I mean look the father is a cop he didn 't seem to care real much about the fact that his daughter is going through one of the most moments in her life . I mean if my daughter was treated like that I would do everything in my power to keep the guy behind jail . Also it seems kind of obvious that Dee Snyders character would turn bad again .

" As other viewers have mentioned , this film was an interesting experiment in photography . The colors are comic book bold . I think the director got carried away with his " " artistic vision " " over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content . Despite its stellar cast , the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent . Madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press . A good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album " " I 'm Breathless ( Music inspired by the film Dick Tracy ) " " which was a stratospheric hit ( due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit " " Vogue " " - which is not in , nor has the slightest relation to this film ) . I 'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to Madonna 's " " I 'm Breathless " " album.If you watch it at home , by end-titles , you 'll think " " there 's two hours out of my life I 'd like to have back .

I want to slap Casper van Diem and the other actors for following this movie through.I 've had my share of cheesy and bad movies ( I love the tremors series ) , but this ...

" I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me.I watched several documentaries about him . He is obviously an intelligent man , with great knowledge about films and passion for making them , but does this makes him a good director . Definitely NO ! A complete anti-talent . He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits , but a film with actors 혯 never ! He can 't direct nor write . His screenplays are full of badly thought out situations , and many situations / dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word " " art " " in any sense . No way . Not to mention the unskillful direction , so amateurish-like . To say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie.Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store . WHO IS HE KIDDING ? He is a cheater ; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want . He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising . Never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction.Just look at Julio Medem . If Herzog can make a movie like Medem can , then I might re-check his old movies and try to find talent in them . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The movie opens with a flashback to Doddsville County High School on April Fool 's Day . A group of students play a prank on class nerd Marty . When they are punished for playing said prank , they follow up with a bigger prank which ( par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds ) goes ridiculously awry leaving Marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough . Fast forward five years , where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion . We find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene , as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious , jester mask-clad murderer in increasingly complicated and mind-numbingly ludicrous fashions . It doesn 't take Sherlock Holmes to solve the mystery of the killer 's identity , as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred Marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario . The film takes a turn for the bizarre as Marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors , only to be haunted by their ghosts . Marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life . Finally , the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as Marty wakes up in a hospital bed , breaks free of his restraints , stabs a nurse , and finally disfigures his own face.The script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic . The only originality comes from the mind-numbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched . The absurd it-was-all-a-dream ending feels tacked on . It 's almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dream.Technically speaking , the film is atrocious . Some scenes were filmed so dark that I had to pause the film and play with the color on my television . The acting is sub-par , even for slasher films . I can 't help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray , which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable . Their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them can 't bother to keep their accents straight through the movie.All of this being said , if you like bad horror movies , you might like this one , too . It isn 't the worst film of the genre , but it 's far from the best . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * * * THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILER ( S ) * * * I 'm not a big fan of Chuck Norris as an actor , but I worship him in all other ways . He also have his own fan web site with " " Chuck Norris facts " " that is really entertaining . But this movie looks like someone was joking with the audience putting all those " " facts " " into one movie . I really don 't remember when I wasted my time more than with this " " action " . " I don 't know what 's the worst this movie can offer you : unoriginal and thousand-times-made plot of terrorists who are trying to nuke US by smuggling nuke on US soil or perhaps that " " great " " dialogs and Chucks words of wisdom about life and everything else . Someone may find the worst that terrorists actually speak English in everyday life . It 's a never ending list of crap . Not to mention huge amount of archive footage used in film , that is kinda annoying . The chief terrorist send his comrades message through the media when he is captured and the only guy smart enough to see the treat is : Chuck Norris , of course . NO ONE else in America is not smart enough to see that ! And the whole action in capturing chief is just ridiculous . One man is sent to walk through a whole terrorist camp UNARMED ( I 'm lying , he had a KNIFE ) , escapes his stalkers with JET PACK and then para glides for few hundred , maybe even thousand kilometers to nearest shore ( Afganistan border is 450 km far away from nearest shore ) , where he is rescued by submarine . I hoped that at least fighting scenes will be good , but that 's even more funny than the plot . If you didn 't know , 85 % of terrorist are masters of some martial art , but Chuck and CO beat the sh * t out of them . Not only they kill them easily , they can kick and throw them away by a single move and the bad guys fly few meters like dolls . You may ask me did I watch this movie to the end ? I did . Why ? Because I just wanted to see who , of these two super heroes , will defuse the nuclear bomb of few hundred megatons and size of a MICROWAVE . And then I realized what fool I am . Of course , it 's Chuck 's movie after all . And not only he singlehandedly defuse nuke with tweezers , but he do it - TWICE ! !

" Looking and sounding like a cheap porno without the sex , this is the first in an impressive string of stinkers from producer ( or in this case director ) Geoffrey Reeve.And it 's a doozy . Laughable on just about every level.Some government agents ( I think ) are " " professionally murdered " " in Amsterdam and a considerably less-than-charismatic , block-of-wood Interpol agent ( who I assure you is not named Louis Salinger ) is sent in to investigate by walking around a lot to ensure the tax-dodge financiers get their money 's worth for the plane tickets to shoot on location.The wannabe-hard-hitting attitudes to drugs and depiction of prostitution must have looked laughably outdated even before the celluloid dried , but the script at least is very obliging in that it explains exactly what 's happening regularly in horribly contrived direlogue ( " " Were you followed ? Oh no of course not . No one outside Washington even knows you 're here ! " " ) yet despite this the plot somehow remains confusing . By the time a sinister Vladimir Putin lookalike Priest ( no less than Kronsteen from From Russia with Love ) swaggers up to his pulpit to deliver a sermon your brain will have switched off , which is unfortunate because you 'll miss our hero - pinned to the ground during a fight - struggling to reach for a plank of wood only to later realise he is in fact sitting on a loaded pistol , and him shouting " " You bastaaaard ! " " at his friend 's murdered corpse , and the leather-bound , moustachioed go-go boys , the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence - all of which provide ample laughs . Only the climactic boat chase impresses . It 's an exciting , well-directed sequence that really has no place in this movie . Such a glaring anomaly is explained when the credits roll - Reeve had nothing to do with that sequence !

I had a good inclination that it was going to be a bad one , but I didn 't think that it 'd be as bad as it turned out . A wooden puppet of a murdered boy falls into the hands of an attorney 's eight-year-old daughter . From there , it is a murderous path for anyone who gets in the way between the puppet and the little girl . We 've seen movies like this before , i.e. the Child 's Play series , which is by the way , far better . However , it was good to see actors like James W. Quinn and Todd Allen . Both of which have worked under Kevin Tenney before . In any event , I encourage viewers to check out " " Night Of The Demons " " and the original " " Witchboard . " " These are titles that tend to bring out the best in Kevin S. Tenney . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Knowing Enki Bilal 's comics for quite some time , I had to see this movie . I have thought this would be a good way for the artist as Bilal to spread his art and ideas to wider audience . I have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend , and I thought I will enjoy watching it ... I was wrong ! The movie was a true torture to watch . The idea has potential ... but , movie leaves way too much to be desired , and basically everyone who sees this movie is left with impression that he could do it better . I will not make suggestion whether you should see this movie or not .

" The story concerns a genealogy researcher ( Mel Harris ) who is hired by her Estee Lauder-like cosmetic queen aunt . Her aunt ( by marriage we are left to presume ) is trying to track down her long lost family in Europe . All they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an ornate music box . The researcher heads to Europe and conducts her search in places like Milan , Budapest , and Vienna . The scenery is the real thing and is actually shot on location ( unlike a Murder , She Wrote where Jessica is supposed to be visiting a far-flung locale and Lansbury never left Burbank ) . Anyway , she meets a young man who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own and they team up to track down clues and menace bad guys . The dialogue , particularly the romantic dialogue , is terrible . I watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that I stayed on just to see if it would get worse . It did . Acting was also off . I can see why Mel Harris 's career never really took off after thirtysomething , but she is adequate ( seems too old for her co-star though ) . But , the supporting players are straight out of the community playhouse . I also lost count of how many times they say " " Budapest " " to each other . Yes , it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht . We know , okay ? I realized halfway into the film that this had to be one of those Harlequin movies and sure enough it is . Guess that says it all . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" It 's true , no one really expects anything from sequels . But even by that low standard this is a terrible film.Essentially an anthology movie , this fourth installment in the Hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a wind-up to the entire series at the same time . An ambitious idea . But none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director Yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling . The result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending . Unless you 're an " " Alan Smithee " " fan , avoid this one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Directors of " " The Messengers " " Danny Pang and Oxide Pang are responsible for " " The Eye " " and its sequel and their premiere American picture plays like " " The Grudge " " -lite set in a farmhouse.A family of four move from Chicago to a run-down sunflower farm in rural North Dakota.Almost immediately their teenage daughter Jess starts seeing ghosts.Of course her parents and the police are skeptical.Admittedly the film is well-made and there are two or three effective scares , but relies too much on ' boo ' effect.Still the plot is a carbon copy of many ghost stories and the ending is anti-climatic and stupefyingly awful.Scares are on the low side too with a tendency toward CGI.Overall , " " The Messengers " " is a pretty weak horror film that simply doesn 't deliver.4 out of 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television ( or the media in general ) as the 1960s ? No . And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time ? Not really . But if we must have one , does it have to be as shallow as " " The ' 60s " " ? I like to think that co-writers Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for this two-part miniseries than what ultimately resulted , especially given Couturie 's involvement in the superb HBO movie " " Dear America : Letters Home From Vietnam " " which utilized little original music and no original footage , letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves . This presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production , but it doesn 't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time ; like so many of its ilk , it 's seen from the point of view of one family . But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the ' 60s ( it 's amazing that one of them doesn 't go to the Rolling Stones gig at Altamont ) , making it seem less like a period drama and more like a Cliff Notes version of the decade.The makers rush through it so much that there 's little or no time to give the characters any character , with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children 's father is especially clich챕d - and then when they 're back on BLAMMO ! it 's something else . Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly . In fairness , Jerry O 'Connell , Jordana Brewster , Jeremy Sisto , Julia Stiles and Charles S. Dutton give their material the old college try , but they 're wasted ( especially the latter two ) ; it 's undeniably good to see David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton , and Rosanna Arquette ( in an uncredited cameo in part 2 ) is always welcome.What isn 't welcome is how " " The ' 60s " " drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect ( and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post-60s America never mentions the British Invasion - no Beatles , no Rolling Stones ... then again , there 's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album , right ? ) . Capping its surface-skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out-of-place happy ending , " " American Dreams " " and " " The Wonder Years " " did it all much , much better . Nothing to see here you can 't see elsewhere , people ... except for Julia Stiles doing the twist , that is . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The film itself is only a compilation of scenes which have no inherent meaning to someone living outside of Russia . I won 't deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time ( filmed 1928 ) but the problem with the film is that it has no interest to the intellectual or common man . We are merely watching an arranged form of pictures , ranging from a one arm man beating a horse , to a toothless soldier in the war . Everything in between is awkward , haphazard and quite unnecessary . It would have been possible to invent a forum which kept the viewer interested but this would not be it although the method of the director is quite brilliant.In all , one should view this if they are an art student , on hallucinogenic drugs , or a student of pre-Tarkovskian cinema . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was previously unaware that in the early 1990 's Devry University ( or was it ITT Tech ? ) added Film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs . Well this movie must have been the product of the class valedictorian . My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix and this movie was on the flip side of the DVD . Do not waste your time with this movie . Awful awful awful . The filmmaker adds 2 main character 's , a woman and her therapist . The woman has been having dreams about the Boogeyman and his victim 's from the first film . Over 50 % of this film is stock from the original movie . The rest of the movie is the main character having the bad dreams while her therapist drones on a the narrator . These scenes are shot through a filter so thick the characters glow . They would make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old . So , to recap , awful . Don 't watch this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Bad actors , family and friends , and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made . It 's really amazing how strings can be pulled to get anything done . If this movie was able to make it out to the general public it puts high hopes on other indie film makers who have talent worth a damn who 're struggling !

" Some movies are off-beat , but enjoyable , but many movies are just mind-numbingly weird . " " Motorama " " fits not-so-nicely in the latter category . Many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense , but those two things can only take a movie so far , and " " Motorama " " simply doesn 't have any other merits to its credit . " " Motorama " " delights itself on plot improbabilities . Its main character , Gus , is a cussing 10-year old on a roadtrip across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces to win $ 500 million . When interacting with adult figures , none of them seem to notice or be concerned with the fact that he 's 10 years old . At first it 's incredibly funny , but it quickly becomes just too unbelievable , especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so unfazed by a lot of the disturbing ( to someone that age ) imagery going on around him . Gus has no depth , and , as an anti-hero who has no problem causing misery for others to get his game pieces , it 's hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters trouble.That trouble is provided by a slew of guest appearances , each mistreating Gus in more and more strange ways . Besides making the already worn-out plot even more unbelievable and less enjoyable , the characters share Gus ' lack of depth and are equally unmemorable . The character 's actions can get a little interesting , but the actors themselves don 't add anything to them , thus negating the whole point of getting big names ( they could 've been played by anyone and the character would 've been the same ) . These guest appearances seem to have been signed more for marquee value than anything else . " " Motorama " " should be interesting - it 's a unique idea , but there 's too little semblance of sense in the script for it to work . Incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti-hero and the viewer don 't , as the movie quickly moves from incident to incident , in the hope that something will eventually make the audience feel sorry or understanding for Gus . That never happens , as by doing so nothing is allowed to connect , it just jerks back and forth as if on a conveyor belt , one incident after another . With a story so nonsensical it ceases to be enjoyable , and a main character who never evolves to care for himself or anyone else on a higher level , " " Motorama " " has little to offer except a brat sneaking around and trying to get rich . Why should we care about that ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" There seems to be a whole sub genre of cheap , tired old sex " " comedies " " out there , that say the same old things about middle class couples .

What we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the type that used to turn up with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night . While it 's tame compared to what gets rammed down the throats of regular cable viewers ( our hero 's naughty bits are either tastefully tucked away behind a strategically glued-on scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect ) , there are prolonged scenes of bondage and torture that lend the proceedings just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for the kiddies . While I have nothing whatsoever against nude female heroes , I do dislike amateurishly made movies ( there are at least four in this series ) . On the plus side , there 's at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I saw . It 's no wonder Nagai 's TESTICLE BOY never made it ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Following the release of Cube 2 : Hypercube ( 2003 ) , and playing off the alleged success of the original Cube ( 1998 ) , Director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy , the prequel Cube Zero.Deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution , time and place unknown , two low-ranking operators , Wynn ( Zachary Bennett ) and Dodd ( David Huband ) sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers , some of which are rigged with death traps . Told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection , these observers have had no problem with their jobs until Wynn , a mathematical genius , discovers that one of the prisoners , a woman named Cassandra ( Stephanie Moore ) never agreed to be put inside the Cube . Suddenly it 's realized that perhaps their " " jobs " " are not what they seem , and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted ... For people that have seen and enjoyed the original Cube , this prequel will probably not be to your liking . It 's not that the story does not have potential ; it 's simply that the first Cube film never needed to be expanded on . Standing alone , it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message . It was also nicely self-contained . The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original , attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing.What this new film has to offer , which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil , certainly are good questions to be raised , but probably should have been done so on their own merits , rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations.Having said this , the other traits of the film , such as acting and direction and writing , are not awful . There is a bleak , dark look to the film akin to such film noir as ' The Matrix ' and ' Dark City ' , and they have certainly managed to recapture the claustrophobic feeling of the first Cube . Unfortunately for Barbarash , these are not enough positive qualities to save it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Very , very humdrum movie fare here with Stella Stevens taking directions from someone in disguise ( it didn 't take me long to guess who it was ) in Old Nevada Town outside Vegas for a money heist in the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas . Stevens leads her girl gang of three , and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated . Despite some neat looks at Las Vegas in the 70 's , very average yet credible acting from most involved , and a plot line with potential , Las Vegas Lady lays one big boring egg . It seems forever for the film to kick into gear , and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up . I was somewhat disappointed with this film . Sure , I wasn 't expecting anything great , but I at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70 's or something like it . Not even close . No one dies . There is a lame gunfight between creaky Stuart Whitman and officious George DiCenzo , one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney Bugliosa in Helter Skelter . The gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall . There is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument . Beyond that nothing in terms of action . And as for the girls , don 't expect much there either . Stella and her girls ( both very mediocre yet pretty talents , get in a sauna and a bath . What do we see ? Nothing but a fleeting side profile . Stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents , but I wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance . That way I could write one thing that would recommend the film . Alas , it was not to be , and I have little to say in this film 's favor . It isn 't a horrible film in any way , it just has nothing going for it either . YAWN . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Oh , where the hell should I begin ? Give a brief summary of the story ? No. either you 've already heard it , or don 't want to . Either way , it sucks . Much like the movie . I happen to be a semi-large horror movie aficionado , and I must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsily-executed movies I 've ever had the displeasure of viewing . The script is horrendously stupid . The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest . All of those torture scenes would have been A LOT more effective if we gave even the tiniest bit of crap for the characters . Since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls meet Capt. Howdy , how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them ? First off , they seem stupid for going to a party with a guy they don 't even know , and second , we don 't even know their damn names ! Why the hell should I care if they live or die ? Not to mention the fact that they actually have the guts to try and make us feel sympathetic towards Capt. Howdy after he 's been " " reformed " " ? PLEASE ! I was cheering when he got his just deserts ! He deserved them ! Hell , he deserved worse ! Also , we 're forced to sit through a pointless misdirect sequence lifted directly from " " The Silence of the Lambs " " ( and here it 's done HORRIBLY ! Of course he 's gonna give them a false address ! And even if he had given them the real one , don 't you think he 'd be waiting and not piercing some guy 's Johnson upstairs ? RETARDED ! ) Then there 's the dialogue . Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid . " " The dead are so dreadfully dead , when they 're dead " " ? ? What the hell kind of crap is that ? ! Dee Snider at one point says " " knowledge is power " . " Well , if that 's true , this film has absolutely no power whatsoever . Then , there 's the plot holes . Yes , I know this is a horror film ( well , wannabe horror film ) , but damn ! You could drive a semi truck into these holes ! First off , these have got to be the DUMBEST cops I have EVER SEEN ! EVER ! ! I mean , DEAR GOD , these guys are morons ! Call for backup , idiots ! Second , how the hell did that humungous septum ring fall out of Captain Howdy 's nose ? ! Evidentially this piercing expert guy says " " that 's the biggest one I 've ever seen " , " but if it 's so damn big , how the hell could it have fallen out so easily ? Did Capt. Howdy just LEAVE it at the crime scene because he WANTED to get caught ? They sure didn 't make it seem like he did . Also , they would NEVER release Capt. Howdy , and I know that for a damn fact . He would be in jail for the rest of his life , and there 's no getting around this . Much less let him return to his old house where he killed / tortured everybody . IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPLAUSIBLE . And now the acting . Dear God did these people suck . Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film . She 's poised and amazing . Too bad she hardly gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap . Amy Smart shows up for about 10 minutes and then drops out of existence . Even the usually entertaining Robert Englund is underused and ineffective here . Dee Snider plays the crazy guy with no talent whatsoever . I never felt threatened , scared or intimidated . I 'd rather have seen Dee Snider in Alexis Arquette 's role in " " Bride of Chucky " . " It would have been so much more fun to see this talent-less hack get it by that lovable psycho doll . Dee Snider just plain sucks . He can 't act ( one of the least scary villains I have ever seen ) , he can 't write ( did he write this damn movie in his sleep ? ) , and he 's obviously dumber than freaking Jessica Simpson ! This film is just a way for Dee Snider to show off all the weird crap he knows about self-mutilation and modern primitives and blah-blah-blah . Either it 's been done before or it just didn 't need to be done . I was bored throughout the whole damn thing . The acting sucks , the music sucks , the script sucks , the pacing sucks , the special FX suck , the directing sucks ... basically , this movie sucks . This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller / horror flick and it fails miserably . It doesn 't manage to scare , shock , or disturb in any shape , way or form . This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life . A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid .

Had I never seen them , I would have thought this good-looking but empty ; since I had , I thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient . The idea of reviving the character in a bigger , slicker production must have sounded good , but there was no point in it , other than the hope of making money ; it 's just a show , which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character 's world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he hasn 't been already ( also , the actor wasn 't at his best ) . I 'd been hoping to see Ichi at a late stage of life , in a story that would see him out gracefully and draw some conclusion from his experience overall ; this just rehashes bits and pieces from the other movies , seasoned with more sex and sfx violence .

" R책zone is an awful movie ! It is so simple . It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life . Just like Zappa did many years ago . But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors . Leon are by many still the little girl in " " krummernes Jul " , " and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie ! Even though i consider it a movie you ought to see . I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this , but i think it can show how it can end , if you are letting your child down . Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like " " Film folket " " ! all in all I think people should see R책zone . Not because it is a great film , but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes . I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it , and actually it is in these scenes , Laura is acting best . - like the ending where she is holding the gun ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A very bad attempt at a young spinal tap . At least the music in spinal tap was good.This is really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at it 's worst . A bunch of Hollywood execs , bad musicians and producers create some " " poopie " " show so their kids can be in the spotlight . Oh please ! ! ! The potty humor was even bad . I hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids ( musicians , actors and artists ) out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes along.Help u all ! ! ! !

" A dedicated fan to the TLK movies , with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel Disney has produced , along comes this film ... Now I 'm not arguing with animation , voice work , music , but this is no more than a Timon / Pumbaa screwloose in the TLK atmosphere . Although it isn 't bad , it doesn 't add anything . Basically this movie is one big joke ... and that 's about all that saves it . Make a real TLK3 , Disney ! The potential is there.4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent . The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the " " gallant " " effort to save the college from ruin , and the moralistic overtone ( especially by the leading lady ) grates a bit.But there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom , and the dancing is quite fun ( especially for alleged amateurs - ha , ha ! ) The shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights .

" I must begin by saying that this is one of the most annoying films I have seen in my entire life ! Annoying factor number one : Never seeing the " " son 's " " face ( for the entire movie ) . And the infinitely more annoying factor : That incessantly ringing phone .. nothing but listening to the phone ring over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ... you get my point . The old man was being harassed but the VIEWER was too ! At first the film was interesting to me but it deteriorated VERY quickly . The film may possibly have been good as a short but was definitely not enough to maintain anything approaching feature film length . I guess what I am trying to say is that the message about racism ( which finally put in an appearance during the last two scenes of the movie ) is secondary to this old mans being harassed . Who cares to sit and watch what is really nothing more than an old man spouting obscenities at someone prank calling him ? ?

" I loved this movie ! It 's the finest parody of Russian cinema to date . Who else but Sokurov could lampoon Tarkovsky so brilliantly . You thought " " Stalker " " was slow ? Well , step up to the plate . " " Mat i Syn " " makes " " Stalker " " look like " " Raiders of the Lost Ark " . " By no means should you miss this film ! There 's no excuse - even if you live a busy life , you can still enjoy this film to its fullest by holding down the fast-forward button on your VCR . Sokurov has given us the first feature length film that can be appreciated in 12 minutes.I suppose the next great masterpiece of the form will come when someone has the vision and courage to exhibit a film that consists of no sound or image at all - 45 minutes of a black , silent screen ( wasn 't this already explored in " " In The Soup " " ? ) .Apparently the filmmaker ( and fans ) have forgotten that " " motion " " is the first word of " " motion picture " . " ! ! ! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! ! Want to reach the heights of genius that this film achieved ? Here 's a step by step guide : 1 . Find a talented photographer.2. Find some subjects and a suitably picturesque landscape ( think Tuscany ! ) . If you need inspiration , watch some luxury car or perfume commercials.3. Shoot about 3 rolls of film.4. Photoshop the results to play around with saturation , blur & aspect ratio.5. Now just get out your movie camera , film 40 of the best pictures and have your " " actors " " mumble their lines off-screen . Don 't worry about writing it ahead of time - just let the actors say whatever they want ( lines like " " Do you want a drink ? " " and " " Let 's get something to eat " " are really all you need to fill up 8 minutes or so ) . If you can 't think of enough dialog - no problem ! Just have them repeat what they say a few times . If that still isn 't enough , just let the camera run anyway.Congratulations , another masterpiece ! As a bonus , if you want to distribute it over the internet , no problem ! The static images will compress down to nothing with standard mpeg encoding - a 73 minute movie would probably be about 2-3 megabytes , even at the highest quality levels . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

How many women really look and live like this when they hit " " rock bottom " " and if I could just borrow some cash from mum and carry out to live my fashion designing dreams - gosh , life would be great ! I was out for a nice chick-date flick with my girl ( my darling hubby likes watching movies together and I knew this wouldn 't be his thing ) , something light and easy on the senses , but this was one bad movie .

I 'm still trying to decipher that accent ! Intellectually dishonest ... this movie is the kind of film that 's able to fool so many people into thinking it 's worthwhile because it has the trappings of something more ambitious .

" I 'll say it again ... one of the worst films ever made and it was made by the director that made one of my most , favorite films - " " Excalibur " .

" I have seen three other movies that are worse than this one , " " Plan 9 from Outerspace " , " " " Side Hackers " " and the dreaded " " Blair Witch Project " " There are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just isn 't believable.Let 's start with an AMTRAK train with no skirts or handrails between cars . The killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the train.In one scene a killer sneaks into a woman 's apartment . He wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her , so what does he do ? He turns up her stereo ! If I heard my stereo suddenly get louder I 'd be concerned . He kills the women by throwing an electric hair curler into the tub . I was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cord could be tossed ten feet and remain plugged in . Plus the apartment looked modern enough to have ground fault outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted.The Boeing 747 is one of the most well known commercial airliners on the planet so this part really amazed me . First the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and second it wasn 't on the top deck of the plane . I watched in utter amazement as the pilot and co-pilot ( Where was the flight engineer ? ) walked right past the spiral staircase and headed forward toward 's the nose of the airplane.I was also amazed that bullets wouldn 't penetrate an aluminum serving cart ( good thing for our hero ) , or bathroom doors , but would penetrate the ceiling causing a fuel leak that exited through a small hole in the fuselage . Huh ? Watching three guys lengthen a runway by 100 yards in less than a week was pretty amazing as well.I didn 't check , was this a movie of the week or something ? It was terrible . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television . I remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man-eating ants . What I didn 't remember was HOW AWFUL IT WAS ! ! ! I recently caught this movie on television late at night . I 'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again ! Suzanne Somers ( at the pinnacle of her career playing Chrissy on ' Three 's Company ' ) plays a vacationer at Lakewood Manor . Constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants ' nest . Or should I say , a * MAN-EATING ANTS ' NEST * ! ! One of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants . One minute he 's picking them off his clothes one by one , the next minute he 's covered in them . The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt.If you thought that was pretty far-fetched , you should see Myrna Loy playing a wheel-chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the Manor via helicopter ! I could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie ! The final scenes depict Suzanne , Robert Foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other , blowing through straws and covered in ants.That 's basically the movie . There 's really no " " disaster " " appeal or " " big-star " " draw to the film . It was intended to be a ' grand-scale ' television event at the time . Now , it 's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4 : 00am timeslot on your local television station.If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at her best , then watch an episode of Three 's Company . If you want to see Myrna Loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills , then watch this movie.0 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As someone else mentioned , it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat . Then the main story : a photographer ( Gaffari ) and a writer ( Shepard ) meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains . First they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at , with increasing irritation to the audience , by Gaffari . Once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers ( Hansel and Gretel , anyone ? ) What happens next I will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because I most assuredly couldn 't . Now , I like Eurohorror , and this woulda been better if only Artigot ( writer AND director ) had made some attempt at logical story telling . The backdrop ( Pyrenees ? ) makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences . The verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them . The photography is nice . Just wish the whole thing made sense . You can view this film at archive.org. , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OK , if I was in the rental store and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three bucks for the rental , I 'd have to say no . The plot was implausible . I 've come to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves can not act . He can , at times , be painful to watch ( though my wife thinks he 's cute ) . Dan Aykroyd ( who is usually great ) was even a little disappointing as the crooked cop . On the plus side , the plot ( because it is far-fetched ) is unpredictable .

" I only bought this DVD because it was dirt cheap and it seemed interesting in its own special way ( " " special " " meaning " " retarded " " ) . The movie turned out to be quite uninteresting - boring camera work , nothing really driving the story , and of course the acting is horrible . It wasn 't even " " bad " " in a campy way - it was just plain bad . There are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its awkward and weak . All I could think about while watching this was that this could actually be a good movie if the script was given a major overhaul ( if it were written by someone who actually understood drug culture ) and if some decent actors were cast . I wouldn 't recommend " " Weekend With the Babysitter " " unless if you plan on a career in film and want to learn what not to do in a movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie . I guess I must have missed something . The beginning is intriguing , the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories . That 's the best part . After the three go their separate ways , the film splits into three threads . That 's when boredom sets in . Certainly , the thread with the Felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity . Unfortunately , the director beat this one to death , even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular . Bottom line : a two-hour plot-thin listlessness .

" Okay ... it seems like so far , only the Barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint . Beware , this writeup is * LONG * .For those not in the knowing ( mostly the non-Belgians ) : Tom Barman , director of this film , is the frontman of dEUS , one of the better known rock bands of the late 90 's here in Belgium . Basically , they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale . Then , egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart , with Barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the dEUS-monicker . The way it always happens in such cases , the post-breakdown dEUS was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original . They tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album " " The Ideal Crash " " in 1999 , presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting . They didn 't quite make it . However , egos were still pretty big it seems : big enough for Barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies.More often than not this sort of thing is a VERY big mistake , and this film does not make the exception . And Barman clearly went for * art * on this one , another very big mistake . For one thing , he 's a musician , not a movie director . For another , dEUS at it 's best made fun and provoking music , but never anything close to what I would consider * art * . It shows.So , what 's this movie about ? Basically , it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people , doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in Antwerp , as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting . The characters are shallow , the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn 't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings . Humor ? The whole film made me smile ( slightly ) about 3 times , and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh ( not quite loud ) . Mood ? The film just doesn 't seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all . Mystery ? Well , ( * MINOR SPOILER * ) the idea of the " " wind-man " , " inspiring the name of the film , is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza - not very , and has been done a thousand times before ( anyone remember Johny Destiny - one of Tarantino 's worst appearances on film to date ) ( * END MINOR SPOILER * ) . And well , its * artistic * , so don 't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous . In other words , except for the few smiles , it bored me out of my shorts.So what remains ? Well , the soundtrack is pretty good , though it suffers from some of the same problems that other OST 's have shown lately : first , it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the CD . Second , it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs , which simply doesn 't work . In the end , it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs . And sadly , it 's Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention , though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as I 'm concerned . All in all , it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies . Camera work is okay as well , though not anything that would make you scream out with joy.The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight-seeing factor . Since I originate from Antwerp , it was fun to play a kind of " " guess-the-location " " game . I would hardly consider this as a quality though.All in all , another chance lost for Flemmish film . I keep on noticing that lately , the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country . This is mostly because at least , they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional ( the brothers Daerden come to mind ) . Maybe the Flemmish art-house filmmakers should try that too . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Egads.I used to think Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood . I not so sure anymore , Willy gives Keannu some stiff competition with his " " I 'm made of plaster " " performance in this movie.Combine that with the fact that there is almost no plot , and not a single likable character , and it 's pretty hard to recommend this turkey.Natasha tries her best , but even Julia Roberts couldn 't save this flick from obscurity.Avoid it unless it 's really late and there 's nothing else on . -Oh heck , in that case just read a book . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Tamara " " just felt like another teen oriented knock-off of the " " I Know What You Did Last Summer " " trend and is painfully dull .

I did appreciate the cat putting on a Bugs Bunny outfit .

" The Robin Cook novel " " Coma " " had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978 . A couple of years later it was the turn of another Robin Cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment , but in the case of " " Sphinx " " virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong . This is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances , stupid dialogue , unconvincing characters and leaden pacing . The only reason it escapes a 1-out-of-10 rating is that the Egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself . Hard to believe Franklin J. Schaffner ( of " " Patton " " and " " Planet Of The Apes " " ) is the director behind this debacle.Pretty Egyptologist Erica Baron ( Lesley Anne-Down ) is on a working vacation in Cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer Abdu-Hamdi ( John Gielgud ) . Hamdi befriends Erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge . Consequently , he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of Pharoah Seti I that he is keeping secretly in his shop . The very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in Erica , for it could provide vital clues in locating Seti I 's long-lost tomb , a prize as great as the discovery of Tutankhamun 's tomb in 1922 . Before Hamdi can tell Erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop , with Erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end . Afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen , Erica attempts to track down the treasure . She finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties , none of whom are truly trustworthy . For one there is Yvon ( Maurice Ronet ) , seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives ? Then there is Akmed Khazzan ( Frank Langella ) , an Egyptian for whom Erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her.The biggest problems with " " Sphinx " " generally result from its total disregard for plausibility . Down couldn 't be less convincing as a female Egyptologist 혯 one assumes she would be quite well-educated and resourceful , yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick . On those rare occasions that she actually isn 't running from a potential villain , she does other brainless things such as taking Polaroid flash photos in a 4,000 year old tomb ! The plot twists are heavy-handed to say the least , mainly comprising of revelations and double-crosses that can be predicted well in advance . One can 't even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare , because the pacing is awfully sluggish . What little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium . A famous review of the movie declared : " " Sphinx stinks ! " " Never before has a 2-hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I suppose I can see why critics give this film two out five stars , it isn 't fantastic , but I think it is worth a look , from director Shawn Levy ( Cheaper by the Dozen , Night at the Museum ) . Basically 14-year-old Jason Shepherd ( Malcolm in the Middle 's Frankie Muniz ) is often lying to his parents and teachers , and his teacher warns him that if he doesn 't do his creative writing , he will fail his whole semester and have to repeat the grade during summer . So he completes his work , but getting a lift from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf ( Paul Giamatti ) , who hit him on the way to school , he manages to leave his paper with the story " " Big Fat Liar " " in the car . He finds out from a movie trailer that Marty stole his paper and is turning it into a major movie , so he and his best friend Kaylee ( She 's the Man 's Amanda Bynes ) are on a mission to prove Jason is for once telling the truth . Marty of course is too nasty and smug to give Jason 's father Harry ( Michael Bryan French ) a phone call , and he evens burns the " " Big Fat Liar " " paper . So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty 's life as hellish as possible , until he agrees to call Jason 's Dad . They put blue dye in his swimming pool , and orange hair dye in his shampoo , and much more naughty pranks creating chaos for Marty 's career . There is the obvious point when Jason looks like he wants to give up , but don 't worry , all characters that despise Marty help out in the final operation , and with Jason 's parents coming , he wants to finally prove his truthfulness , and boy does he deliver , big style . Also starring Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham , Lee Majors as Vince , Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson , Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell , Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan , Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pie 's John Cho as Dustin ' Dusty ' Wong . Muniz is likable , Byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support , and even though he is wasting his time and talent a little , Giamatti is great at being nasty . It is a kids film , so if it seems corny , cheesy or predictable , just keep that in mind , and try to enjoy the performances and slapstick . Okay ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This must be one of the most annoying , arrogant , poser films I 've ever seen . What a waste of budget and actors . Angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness . It is clear there is virtually no plot , even if this part of Greek history is material for great movies . He simply had some supposedly symbolic ( actually shambolic ) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them . Death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam , along with litanies , processions and the like , which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself . A totally incoherent result , which can only leave you saying " " huh ? " " or " " oh dear " " every two minutes . There is no character development at all , nada , zilch . I 'm usually complaining about some movies having two-dimensional characters , but oh boy , he managed to create one-dimensional characters . This is irritating for us and degrading for some of the actors . He even managed to make one of my favourite Greek actors , Giorgos Armenis , seem wooden . And going to the core of Angelopoulos film-making : No we 're not idiots . We do not want chewed food . Please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle . Theo do you really underestimate your audience so much or you 're simply incompetent ? Personally , I think he tried to make a Greek " " Underground " . " No matter how he tries , he can 't reach Kusturica.Only saving grace : Photography , costumes and the music . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I , like so many others on here , bought this movie at my local WM in the " " Two for $ 11.00 " " cheap-o bin . I love cheesy B horror and sci-fi movies , and this one definitely fits in that category . Pretty much what everyone else on here said is dead on . Yes it was bad , but that was to be expected . The " " main " " problem I had with this movie is that it was just basically BORING . I mean serious yawn-o-rama . The acting was bad , the costumes ( K Mart Skeletor outfit circa 1982 ) were worse , and the editing was awful . No continuity whatsoever . Mr Skeletor ultimately dies in an explosion of sorts ... uh , although he encountered multiple explosion throughout this move . I guess the last one just took its toll on him . Apparently earlier encounters with this " " military " " group ( cough ) took its toll on his horse .... it would change from red to black throughout this crap fest . Even for a B movie , do yourself a favor and skip it . The only good it serves me now it to add to my DVD collection . Hopefully no one will recognize it when they look through my movie collection .

" I can 't believe this movie was made as recently as 1984 . It 's got some laughable acting , not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever . Who would ever ask fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to escort an Italian he illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy ? Not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it - in fact , it 's about as generic a title for a wannabe action / cop film as I can think of.I 'm glad I only saw this on MST3K with Mike and the bots as a shield . They remark on the female lead 's resemblance to Elaine from Seinfeld ( " " None of them are spongeworthy " " ) and riff non-stop on Baker 's weight . This movie probably isn 't worse than " " Mitchell , " " but Baker 's reputation definitely precedes him here : when his title comes up at the beginning of the film , Tom says , " " I wish I was illiterate so I wouldn 't have to read that .

" Ocean 's 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on . Like a celebrity awards presentation , each major actor / actress is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking " " applaud now " " sign . The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed , poorly edited , and at times , utterly unrelated to the story and confusing . Speaking of the story , ... there is one , kinda , ... but its barely visible for all the " " look at me " " shots and cameos . Only Matt Damon seemed to actually " " act " " during this film ... the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session . As for the heist , the action , the drama .... it was put into the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic . Horrible ! Horrible !

" it MIGHT have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie ... it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian group t.A.T.u .... coincidence ? i don 't think so . There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous.You know the recipe . The other actors ... well , i just don 't know what their role is supposed to be . Most of them are well - known people in Romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors ( e.g.Mihaela Radulescu ) .SO to summarize it : " " girl band tatty " " + desperate / publicity needing " " actors " " + a non-existing plot + the occasion to use bad language in order to shock = Love sick .... too bad ... the idea was good , though ... and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill " " wonder of the human body " " documentaries by bravely , if bizarrely , opting to elicit disgust in the viewer . In one scene , the camera closes in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it . In another , the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo . In a final tour de force , the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of ... teenage armpit hair . Unfortunately , I 'm not making any of this up . See this film if you must , but : bring your vomit bag , and don 't have pasta salad beforehand . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" So much for JUDGE AND JURY , which lives up to its nonsense title . What good is there ? The lighting is terribly foggy ! Another horror movie you ask ? Well , that 's perfectly explainable . David Keith actually does pretty good at disguising clowns , chefs , and other shenanigans while being the killer who escaped death row . But overall , despite some new twists , it 's reasonably stupid . Unapix has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently , and this one only means so much . We , the jury , find this film guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us sitting around believing it 's a total waste of our time ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

As I watched it , I started laughing , thinking to myself , does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real ? So I had to look it up , and now see that it is a movie , but now since it isn 't a documentary , it is now a movie with bad acting . SO , either way , it is pretty bad . I actually didn 't make it to the end . I had to shut it off . I am a NYC Police Officer , and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary , with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers .

" I desperately want to give this movie a 10 ... I really do . Some movies , especially horror movies are so budget that they are good . A wise-cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry ... definitely fits this ' budget to brilliance ' system .

" I had never read Gary Paulsen 's novel , Hatchet , for which ' A Cry in the Wild ' is the adaptation of , so I can 't make any comparisons to the book . I will , however , say that as a film on its own , adaptation or no adaptation , it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters.Think of ' A Cry in the Wild ' as a less luxurious , teenage mountaineer ( was Quincy , California the only place this was filmed ? ) version of ' Cast Away . ' Jared Rushton is 13-year-old Brian Roebson , a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father , until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain , leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself.There are basically three parts to the film . The obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters , namely Brian and his mom . The next third of the movie ( which really consumes nearly all of the film ) is that of Brian " " roughing it . " " These scenes contain no particularly amazing action , nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful Yukon landscape . Nothing to put you on edge , no real encounters ( except a brisk confrontation with a cub ) , and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen . You might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness Brian dealing with his situation through first , primitive means , and then more improved ones ( using tools , etc ) for his survival . It is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation , and that is pretty much about it . In other words , they put no meat on the Paulsen 's words when they translated them into a visual media.And , of course , the third part of the movie is his rescue.There is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time , however . Some conflict between Brian and his parents that created a rocky , awkward relationship between them . However , for the most part , it is only explained in brief , intermittent , minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video . Any minute , the singer from Jefferson Starship , should chime in an start singing ' Sara . ' Other than what the viewer can draw from the implications , or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative , we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters , whether or not it really had anything to do with Brian 's survival adventure in the third part of the movie . These are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and , for me , almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more ! It certainly was not , for me , a good adventure tale . But , for fans of Jared Rushton , it was one of the last few movies he made . So , watch it purely for nostalgia , if nothing else . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing : sex . Don 't get me wrong , I 'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all I 'm interested in is highly offensive . Take The Convenant , a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and / or a script that wasn 't written by a six year old . This is essentially The Craft with ( supposedly ) hot guys . And , yeah , that 's it . It bored me to tears . Even my friend , who usually laps us crap films , hated it . It is really stunningly bad , to the extent where it can actually be funny . I would have laughed if it wasn 't for the fact that several other females in cinema attendance seemed to be enjoying it . They were accompanied by several shifty looking guys who positively curled up and died when the ( really clich챕 ) boy on boy kiss happened towards the end . Watching them squirm really was the highlight of the film . I don 't think mainstream , Hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers ( or , indeed , for anyone ) so I think I 'll give up . Unless you 're a teen who likes The Pussycat Dolls , thinks Paris Hilton is " " hot " " and watches MTV it 's like some sort of wasteland . Life 's hard when you 're a fifteen year old who likes art house . : ( P.S.

It 's not like anyone else is interested . She 's the only reporter there . Anyway , her editor discourages her from working on this lame story . But hey , she does anyway .

In the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street , there 's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse , some car chases with wreckage & death , a fake suicide , etc. etc . Lotsa stiffs , all kindsa carnage . Great stuff , but what the reporter and the bodyguard can 't figure is : why in hell the original guy got whacked . What 's the motivation ? Of course , it might help us to figure out why the reporter 's even interested . Through almost all of this she 's the only reporter on the story . Nobody else in the media cares . Not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies . True , the original guy who got whacked wasn 't exactly a celebrity . His job was a little bit dull . He was just the President . Yeah , the one who lives in the White House . Oh , and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent.Is that the spoiler ? It should be . After all there are no TV cameras , no other print reporters , no bloggers ... just another one of those police blotter crimes ... So what 's the spoiler ? Lemme think ... No ! Wait ! The spoiler is that his wife did it ! Yeah ... the First Lady . She was p---ed because the President was fooling around . And she gets away with it . She 's really sharp , huh ? But how the hell could anybody ever figure that out ? Why would anyone bother ? After all , only one reporter is even interested . I give this move a " " 1 " .

" " " Dutch Schultz " , " AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer , was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented . This movie which purports to depict his life should have used a fictional character , because the overdramatized events are too strong a departure from the facts and the chronology . Not only that , it ignores some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations fiasco in upstate N.Y. and his religious conversion . It is true that he was executed by Luciano , Lansky , et. al. but that 's as far as it goes . The exploding plate scene which represents Luciano carrying out the execution of Bo Weinberg in his own home , assisted by his own mother is rediculous . Also , there is the scene in which Dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to Legs Diamond . It just doesn 't work . The character of Mrs. Fleggenheimer doesn 't work either . This movie does not need a doting Jewish mother for comic relief . The lame representation of Legs Diamond was humorous enough . I 'm sure the man is turning in his grave . And , by the way , Dutch did in fact personally kill people , but , he was not Rambo or 007 . The scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd . I don 't know . Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I just didn 't get it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am not a big fan of horror films , and have only seen a handful of them ( and none of the " " Halloween " " s or " " Friday the Thirteenth " " s ) - but I can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore . And I 'm pretty sure this isn 't scary . What 's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere ? In all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots , so there 's no real surprise in any of this film . ( Not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway , but . . . ) The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow 's third cousin ( John Hudson ) , who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like ( Peggey Webber , giving one of the worst performances ever ) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband 's mansion . Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident ? OOOOH ! ! ! ! Wonder who did it ! ! ! ! This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and / or drive their wife insane . If you want to see a well-done version of this stuff , try " " Reversal of Fortune " . " And BTW , Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson . The MSTing was okay but nothing special ; paired with the " " Gumby " " short , however , it makes for good viewing . Two stars for " " The Screaming Skull " " ; eight stars for the MST3K version . And now , to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself : " " How bad is this film ? " " " " You have no idea !

And that 's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen : that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience .

The casting ( and direction ) in Undercurrent is more insipid than inspired in this noir clunker that fails from the outset to get off the ground . Robert Taylor 's wooden style poses a roadblock almost immediately for the highly affected Kate Hepburn and it 's bad chemistry from the outset.Naive and innocent Ann Hamilton ( Hepburn ) falls for handsome airplane manufacturer Alan Garroway ( Taylor ) and rushes to the altar with him . She soon finds out there is a lot she does not know about him . As Alan becomes more remote she delves further into the murky past and Ann soon finds herself living a nightmare instead of the American dream.Undercurrent resembles a few Hitchcock plots but Vincent Minnelli rapidly establishes he is no master of suspense . Hepburn is no shrinking violet and she is a hard sell for a character more suited to the reticent styles of Teresa Wright or Joan Fontaine . Minnelli never really succeeds in getting Kate to defer in desperate fashion to Taylor 's limited abilities as an actor . Her attempts come across as silent Gish while Taylor 's wide descent into madness takes on restrained Bela Lugosi . Robert Mitchum completes the miscasting as the sensitive brother . Talk about piling on.Cinematographer Karl Freund provides some highly stylized noir interiors but Minnelli and cast utilize the atmospherics meekly and the tension remains tepid . With Minnelli far from his forte ( musicals ) and Hepburn 's victim role fitting her like a bad suit Undercurrent drowns all involved . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Really , average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see this.The acting was average ( maybe a bit above average ) , the camera usage was average ( actually below average . The picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry . ) The plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasn 't put to good use.This could 've been so much more if it didn 't go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgrounds.All we see are flashbacks here and there of Alice and how her home life is so " " bad " " ( her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter . ) We see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her " " tell your Mom to make some better food " " and " " everybody says it 's your mom . " " Yeah that 's embarrassing but why would you run away from it . I could definitely see if her Mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it . How immature ! We 're not even given a glimpse of what the couple 's lives have been like ( except that they 've been prostituting for awhile and the woman , forgot her name , gave her baby up when it was 9 months old . ) This really could 've been so much more . It could 've had Alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to Florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute . Or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie ( that is ) Alice , a girl with a home life of probably 90 % of America 's population ( WORKING CLASS ) runaways to Florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitute.I don 't see why it won an award at Sundance ( it must 've been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award . ) Also to me , Alice 's Boston / New England accent seemed forced . It didn 't seem genuine . ( I should know , I was born and raised in Boston , but now live in Georgia . ) 4 / 10 Not really worth your time in my opinion . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Compared to the recent gore flick HOSTEL , which this movie reminded me a lot of-- I would say that See No Evil is slightly better but not by much . The very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter jail sentence . The kids soon end up being killed off by a lumbering religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins ( I guess ) . The one thing I dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a WWE wrestler , Kane . He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one-word lines in the movie . There are a couple fairly gory moments , mainly involving eye-gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat-- probably the most effective demise in the movie.I can 't say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely far from great . Can 't recommend it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There 's plenty to appreciate here : spectacular locations and flying sequences ; period costumes , props and sets ; and competent writing and acting . However , to enjoy a drama , we need at least one principal who exhibits some qualities that we can like or admire . In this bunch of catty snobs , we found only one character who is at all likable 혰 a hapless enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim . From the reviews here , it is clear that we are completely out of step , but we did not find their malicious-schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining . Even the dog is detestable .

" Yes , even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice , this show is pretty bad . I didn 't mind the first couple of shows , but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place.The antics of Alex and Aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show.Ryan , you can have Trista . She had the most annoying voice I 've ever heard on television , and she definitely wasn 't the smartest girl around ( very media savvy , but I doubt there 's much more there ) .I haven 't really watched any of the shows since , apart from the occastional re-run on daytime TV . I think the point of reality TV is to treat it as " " entertaining trash " . " View it as something you can laugh over , and don 't have to think too hard about ( I don 't watch CSI its like reality TV-tired and clich챕d , but you have to think too much anyway while watching ) .A couple of thoughts on some reasons fro going on the show . At the very first ' the woman tell all " " Woman such as Amy ( who had a lot of class about her ) commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it wasn 't happening for her . Hey Amy , how about joining a club ? getting a hobby ? doing charity work ? changing your job to one where you meet more guys ? gees , all I know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner.Amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting " " the perfect man ' . Clue to ladies : he doesn 't exist . There are , however , many great guys out there that would make great husbands , some who may be right for you ! they may not earn six figures a year or be a JFK junior look alike , but they are great guys all the same . The shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable . Im still a youngster , at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner . This show is proving otherwise.Overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society . It really is a terrible show and I think all of these types of shows should just stop being made . The best dating shows by a country mile are Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel because they are fun . Nothing is manned more between the " " couples " " than a simple night out. the bachelor , sadly takes itself way too seriously . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Dialogue : stilted , clich챕d ; Acting : hammy , clich챕d ; Plot : predictable , clich챕d.Just what are Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this " " B " " rubbish ? Plummer was well established decades before this movie was made , Kinski had masterpieces like " " Tess " " and " " Cat People " " behind her ... Must have been desperate.The bad guys all have bad-guy accents - * bad * bad-guy accents ! ( Plummer especially ! Where * did * he learn to do " " German " " ? ) and most of them have bad-guy sneers as well . The innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh . The good guy survives , amongst other things : * a 5 " " throwing knife buried hilt-deep in his shoulder - just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all ; * marines ' machine-gun fire ( I think someone referred to a .50 ) in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp ; * several fist-fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium-first into a door frame ; * a fall , backwards , from what looks like the third floor , onto paving , without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience . The script has exactly 3 clever lines , the rest of the time it 's all so dull and boring.OK it 's not all bad . Plummer does bring a certain class to his part , and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick . Of course that doesn 't say much , but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here . He delivers his " " Ve haff vays and meance " " type lines with some menace , but you are always aware you are watching Christopher Plummer acting the villain.This movie is truly an awful waste of time . The acting , such as it is , is sort of 70 's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets Bruce Lee 's very obviously faked fight scenes , but it 's not even anywhere near as good as either a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee film .

" * This comment may technically contain " " spoilers " " but it sure doesn 't contain surprises * My cousin and I rented this the other day hoping to get a good laugh at a typical amateur crappy excuse for a horror movie . Unfortunately , we didn 't get too many laughs , and we certainly didn 't get too many scares either.Plot outline : A plane containing a company head 's daughter and some weird piece of technology crashes in an area where our furry friend lives , so the company head assembles a team of personalities , rather than skilled hunters , to recover it.For the first 3 / 4 's of the movie , things get pretty boring . It mostly consists of shots of Big Foot lurking in the trees with the party members occasionally hearing him , and passing it off as nothing . We also see several shots of the party through Big Foot 's point of view , and he apparently sees in thermal vision.To set up the plot , we have to watch sequences of the group sitting around the campfire talking about possibilities to justify the sasquatches existence and actions . " " maybe he can dodge bullets ... if he sees them coming " . " Sure enough , we later see he can . " " There are many uncharted lands that the sasquatch may live in . Maybe this is one of them that was over-looked " . " And obviously it is . " " Maybe the Sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members " . " And sure enough , thats the case . Along with those scenes , there are a couple of " " Oh my god its the sasquatch oh wait its just you ! " " scenes , and sadly , they are among the scariest.Then , finally , people start dying . Well , 2 people at least . Plus , the bodies of past victims are discovered . The death scenes are pretty lame . It mostly just leaves it to our imagination by showing the Sasquatch grabbing them , then cutting to a different scene , but first , we are treated to some horrible screams off camera.Then at last , we get to see the protagonist 's final showdown with the monster . I gotta admit , I found it pretty exciting while it lasted . But alas , it 's pretty short lived , and after we are treated to an ending that makes a half assed effort to seem cryptic . Then , some closing text with a rather boring conclusion.I can 't say I recommend this movie . It 's not quite bad enough to give the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 , and its definitely not scary enough and boring to enjoy as a horror movie . Just don 't bother with it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic throwback to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels . It 's where the first novel ( Dune , Ender 's Game ) blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story . The sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make . The Matrix is finally the film equivalent . The Matrix stands tall , alone , as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle . Seeing this cash cow just sitting there , and wanting to explore other aspects of society , the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most painful monologues and non-action sequences in SciFi . While the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies , the new explorations of the characters falls terrible flat in the sequel .

There all annoying and stupid . Especially Margaret who thinks she 's the most popular girl in school and thinks she 's soo pretty ... its just beyond awful . I hate all the seasons of this show , its just terrible in every way ( the first season was better though ) .If you value your life , you wouldn 't watch this crap , its painful and stupid , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I started watching this because I was looking for a nice ' background ' comedy for my Sunday morning . Then I noticed that this was going to be a road-movie and I decided to actually watch this.First 15 minutes were awful , but I wanted to give this a chance , because I never judge a movie without watching it throughly . Then things started to get little better . This seemed like a nice road-movie about friendship .. But then the movie started to get horrible predictable clich챕-twists and when the movie was over it left you feeling like you had wasted your time . Did this have anything to say ? Why did they even make a movie like this ? And I wasn 't expecting a modern Citizen Kane , but still , I have several ideas how this movie could have been improved.So take my piece of advice ; leave this alone and go watch a real road-movie . There are many of those . I won 't make the directors of those movies seem bad by putting their names on this review.1 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Priscilla , Queen of the Desert " " is always being trotted out as a masterpiece of Australian cinema . I found it quite disappointing . The lead actors are great - Terence Stamp is aging beautifully , Guy Pearce should do more comedy instead of the dour roles he chooses and I 've been a fan of Hugo Weaving since I saw him play Oberon eons ago . The cinematography is great , but if you 've ever been to the Australian outback , you 'd know that the air is so clear and the light so brilliant that they could have shot it on the movie equivalent of a Box Brownie and it still would have looked spectacular.So what 's my problem ? Well , three things . First , there is not a sympathetic female character in the whole film . A woman who has to earn her living shooting ping pong balls out of her privates in a roadside pub deserves our sympathy . Tick 's wife doesn 't get much better treatment.Second , the scene when they sing " " I Will Survive " " to a group of Aboriginals is offensive . To try to draw any sort of parallel between the struggles of drag queens and trannies and the almost total destruction of Aboriginal culture , which is what I assume the scene is supposed to do , shows a level of historical understanding worthy of Paris Hilton.Last of all , and the greatest defect of the film is that it just isn 't funny enough . Did Stephan Elliott actually talk to any drag queens when writing the film ? Anyone who knows a drag queen ( or three or four ) knows that most of them have rapier-like wits and they 're not afraid to use them . Now , I can understand that a lot of drag queen banter probably would have got the film refused classification but Elliott should have been able to gather enough " " fit for the kiddies " " material to complete his film.So , all in all , a waste of a good idea and a great cast . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Purported documentary that tries to examine sci-fi films of the 1950s and how they affected ( and REflected ) America . Steven Spielberg , George Lucas , Ridley Scott and James Cameron are interviewed and Mark Hamill narrates.Pretty terrible . The " " insights " " that are given are nothing new--for instance--the Cold War and the threat of nuclear war affected a whole generation of children . Well-duh ! They try to cover all of the different sub genres of sci-fi films of the 1950s--the big bug movies , invaders from space movies etc etc . That 's good but they choose the most obvious films and they 've been over analyzed to death already . It was cool seeing clips from " " Rocketship X-M " , " " " Destination Moon " , " " " Forbidden Planet " , " " " The Thing " " and " " The Day the Earth Stood Still " " but everything the directors said was so incredibly obvious to any viewer that it 's insulting .

" Utterly ridiculous movie which makes fun of the college admission process . While it is true that the SAT 's is not everything in evaluating a student for admission to college , what the movie talks about is utterly ridiculous and not worth repeating nor viewing.College admissions officials are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the entire process . The film is an insult to hard-working high school students who work hard and then have to suffer through a long process until they receive that letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools they have applied for . This movie certainly deserves rejection on all levels . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This film could have been great- but wasn 't . Amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent . The main star of the film plays a good lead role . He is convincing and has those scary Italian eyes . However , he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across . The opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing . It looks like Gay Porno . Fortunately no one stripped off . The rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish . The prison sequence was the best part of the film- although irrelevant . The movies soundtrack ( if you can call it that ) sounds like a teenage boys first attempt at using cooledit and some sample cds . It is boring , repetitive and extremely lame .

" Three Stooges - Have Rocket , Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature length film to star the Stooges and it is pretty bad . It makes THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE ( from 1963 ) look like a masterpiece.The Stooges are janitors at a rocket place . They climb into a rocket and it goes to Venus . They meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call " " Uni " " which they bring back to Earth with them . " " Uni " " speaks like an average , pleasant person - ' Oh , hello . How are you ? Lovely planet here . Hope you like it . ' Hilarious.Very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and on.The Stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes , but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens . The Stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over.High point of the film - the end where the Stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey . The Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies . Brutal.Another writer mentioned the fine musical score . Huh ? The only music I even noticed were two classic tunes - I 'LL TAKE ROMANCE and THERE GOES THAT SONG AGAIN , both of which are played at the party . And * that * really is the high point of the picture - music from old Columbia films.The tall sexy blonde was nice.Awful - a brand new VHS video from the 99 Cents Only store . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue . Like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer , this movie is cognizant of the conventions of this type of horror movie and manages to come up with a few good lines and scenes that play on those conventions . Unfortunately , Shrieker is just boring . The plot is your basic Ten Little Indians whodunnit with a monster controlled by one of the suspects / victims . You know from the beginning that each of the characters will get bumped off until only the hero ( ine ) is left to defeat the evil . And this is exactly what happens . Absolutely no surprises and no tension . Production values and acting were ok , but I had no motivation to watch to the end ( although I did ) because I already knew how the end scene would play out . The ending did surprise me a bit , because it managed to fizzle out , literally , instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects . Maybe the special effects budget had been spent up by the end . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones . Well , that 's my opinion anyway . This one will always be in the bad movie category , simply because all but Shu Qi 's performance was terrible.Martial Angel tells of Cat ( Shu Qi ) , a professional thief turned straight after leaving her lover , Chi Lam ( Julian Cheung ) , two years before . But her past returns to haunt her as Chi Lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software belonging to the company Cat works for . In order to rescue him , she calls on her old friends from her orphanage days , six other feisty women , to save the day ... I may have told the synopsis cheesily , but this is a cheesy story . In fact , the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all . Much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as rice-paper in water . If I could sum it up , take a bad Jackie Chan movie , remove the comedy , remove the choreography , throw away the budget , and you have Martial Angels : a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at all.Mind you , I do have to give credit where credit 's due , and Shu Qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action , as it was her performance that shone through . Okay , you can 't say she was excellent - after all she had absolutely nothing to work with - but she did manage to dig some character out from her role . Other than that , only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made any other impression - although these were mostly glimmers and very brief.Elsewhere , the film just fell to pieces . Scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable , special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen , poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes , camera angles that were elementary and unflattering , and direction I 've seen better from a lost dog.I guess this film was a too many cooks affair . Most probably , the budget was blown away on the over-enthusiasm to have seven babes on the same silver screen . That didn 't leave much else.Frankly , the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn . Charlie 's Angels , it ain 't . In fact , while sisters can do it for themselves , none of that was really that apparent here.Definitely one to forget . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes.Example : When Dave retrieved his keyboard from the rain , I was eagerly anticipating the funny sounds that were going to come out of it .

A truly witty writer would have not only had a field day with that , but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital keyboard can become completely soaked but then work perfectly.There were at least 10 other similar situations .

I give it a 1 out of 10 , just because there is no zero . I seriously implore anyone with an IQ of over 60 not to watch this , and not to waste your money . The 1.6 / 10 should tell it all .

" Forget everything that you have ever read about the Mallachi Brothers ' straight-to-video release " " Snakes on a Train , " " especially if it was a negative review . This movie is way more fun than the movie that it obviously rips off : " " Snakes on a Plane . " " Frankly , I am surprised that more people aren 't rhapsodizing about this low-budget Asylum Release . Instead , most reviews that I 've read have nothing kind or critically worthwhile to say except the usual stupid herd mentality idiocy , such as the acting was amateurish , the action didn 't numerically live up to the advertising , and the entire thing amounted to a hideous waste of time . Of course , it doesn 't help that the title is a tip-off to the obvious rip-off nature of this film . Actually , I felt that " " Snakes on a Train " " surpassed " " Snakes on a Plane " " for a number of reasons.First , the producers used real , genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they substituted either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a super-giant snake that consumed an entire Amtrak like train . How many movies have a snake gobble a train ? As a result , " " Snakes on a Train " " ranks as the first movie to scale that height.Second , this low-budget movie employs some grisly gross-out effects . The woman who coughs up baby snakes--real ones--was fantastic ! The special effects of her forearms getting tore up later in the movie were visually enticing ! Also , you get to see a little white girl get eaten alive by a snake . She was as cute as she could be , no more than 10 years old or thereabouts , and she died screaming all the way as nasty ol챕 giant mister snake head swallows her . Not only kids in jeopardy but kid eaten ! This is exactly the kind of graphic material that you won 't find in 99 % of all theatrical Hollywood releases . Of course , she wasn 't eaten by a real snake , but it 's the subversive thought that counts.Third , it is one of those cursed upon movies where Alma ( Julia Ruiz of " " That Guy " " ) , the chief female character--no heroine--has a curse placed on her by her parents because she didn 't marry the man that they recommended . As a result , she is filled with snakes , coughs up quantities of green radiator fluid slop then chucks up a baby snake . Imagine Medusa , the mythical characters that had snakes for hair , only with the snakes in her belly . Her psycho-shaman type boyfriend collects all the snakes that come out of her because they are heading to L.A. on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back inside of her and return her to normal . Talk about a whacked out character performing stomach churning routines . Prepare yourself for lots of slime , blood , and gore . Fourth , the train had only about twenty or so passengers , not hundreds . Nevertheless , it looked like the Mallachi Brothers filmed this above-average horror flick on-board a real train with real snakes and they played up the swaying motion of the train on the tracks.Fifth , the snakes slither around for the first hour , quietly infiltrating the train before they turn weird and attack everybody . In other words , it 's suspense , suspense , suspense , before people start dying from snake bites.Up until the last five minutes when the snake grows bigger than the runaway train and swallows it , " " Snakes on a Train " " is warped , wonderful , and way-out . It doesn 't have the Attention Deficit editing of a big league Hollywood movie . It 's a fantasy about an unfortunate Hispanic women victimized because of her feminist , at-odds-with-society attitude . Altogether , you 've got gory fantasy type stuff ; suspenseful snakes slithering around the train , and am over-the-top gigantic snake at the end . Incidentally , they get on board the train because a bunch of other Mexicans have bribed a train employee and the Mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend on free.I think it 's better than " " Snakes on a Plane " " if you want a tough , little , independently produced horror movie . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I went to see this because I 'd never seen Tel-Aviv , where the story is set . I was disappointed , since it doesn 't offer many views of Israel 's largest metropolis . It 's also pretentious혰one of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders.The main protagonist is Batya , a woman in her twenties ' who works as a waitress at catered weddings . Her parents evidently don 't care about her very much , and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her , Batya feels compelled to take care of her . The little girl doesn 't speak , and Batya can 't give her to social services because it 's the weekend and the agency is closed . So she takes her back to her apartment with the leaky roof , and when it comes time to work in the evening , she has to take the little girl with her . The boss is very unhappy about this and other shortcomings in Batya 's work performance.Another main character is Keren , who is getting married . At her wedding party ( where Batya is of course working ) , she breaks her leg climbing out of a ladies ' room cubicle whose door won 't open , and so she and her new husband cannot take the Caribbean vacation they 've planned . They end up in a dingy hotel on the seafront without a view . It smells bad , there is noise from the traffic , and Keren is complaining all the time . Her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman 혯 a writer 혯 who is also staying in the hotel , and Keren worries that he has slept with this stranger.The third main character is a Filipino woman named Joy who looks after old people . The old woman she is hired to care for is very crabby and speaks no English , only German and Hebrew . Joy speaks English but no Hebrew or German . Joy is mostly concerned with how her son is doing back in the Philippines , and wants to buy him a toy boat , as he has asked . She finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it . The daughter of the old woman , who hired Joy , is an actress appearing in some sort of post-modern " " physical theater " " adaptation of Hamlet , and does not get along with her mother.The way in which these three stories혰which intersect momentarily혰resolve themselves is presumably supposed to mean something profound . I didn 't get it . There is a fantasy element to Batya 's relationship with the little girl , and maybe Batya 's non-existent relationship with her parents is somehow inverted in this relationship . When Joy sees the toy boat in the shop window , there is a strange effect used where the little sails billow as if blown by the wind , and they do this as if they are on the scale of a real-life ship . Keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is on a brochure cover in the hotel room , and a narration of the strange woman 's poetry mentions a ship in a bottle . But what does all this mean ? I thought about it for a while and realized I wasn 't going to lose any sleep in the process . If anyone out there has a clear idea of what it 's all about , maybe they can fill me in . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" At what point does a film become so bad it 's good ? Compelling in it 's awfulness , Darkhunters stands out as a shining example of c * * p cinematography and for that alone , probably deserves some kind of award.The plot revolves around the age old battle of Heaven and Hell for the unclaimed souls of the recently dead . In the case of Darkhunters , the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves variously as a herd of cats , a hooded Grim Reaper figure with a face of flickering flames similar to a coal effect electric fire , a Philip Marlowe-a-like with a seriously bad manicure and a female psychologist who appears to be on day-release from Kwik-Save.The protagonists are competing for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film running around a foggy field and bizarrely , a boarding kennels in an attempt to evade his pursuers.The plot is spread thinner than a dieter 's sandwich with no character development or attempt to build suspense . The acting is laughable , comparable to a school play - although that would be an insult to many educational establishments . And the dialogue .......... oh , how my sides ached ! With the unclaimed souls of the dead being described as " " life 's unwanted gherkins " " by the flame-glow demon , you wonder whether Hell really is a McDonalds.But is is bizarrely compelling , you find yourself watching just to see how bad it can get - at just over 80 minutes , it 's worth the time spent for the unintentional giggles . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" So I got this from the rental store where I work before it was released ( release is 8 / 21 ) , just watched it today , and now I 'm speechless . They could have had a decent movie here , but they screwed it up in some painfully obvious ways.First of all , the parts with John Krasinski were funny , and are the only reason I gave it above a 3 , but they are broken up by bad acting and terrible " " serious " " reflections on life between the main character ( Andrew Keegan ) and his girlfriend ( the annoying Lacy Chabert ) . It would have been much , much better as a straight comedy ala Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.I wanted to like it , because I think Krasinski is funny and want to see him do well . The story wasn 't bad either , just not very original . But the directing ( and a lot of the acting ) was terrible . I swear they had trouble keeping peoples faces in the shot and just went with it anyway.Their carelessness is showcased when the gun expert corrects another character and says that a " " Dirty Harry " " gun is not a .357 magnum but a .45 ( it was , as everyone knows , a .44 magnum ) .So see this if you 1- really like John Krasinski 2- like to watch low-budget ( and poorly-directed ) movies or 3- Have too much time on your hands ( this is me ! ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Flashdance is one of those awful , stupid movies that you actually kind-of enjoy , just because they 're so crap . I just watched it on TV & my friend and I were amazed at how dopey it was . It 's true that Don Simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of a fairly cheap , lowbrow flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a soundtrack of ( admitedly catchy ) pop , so Flashdance is an odd sort of pioneer : the first MTV movie . Adrian Lyne started out in advertising and it shows because Flashdance is almost a commercial for itself . You 've already decided to watch it but the movie has this weird , panicky undercurrent , as though it 's frightened that you might change your mind at any moment . It keeps selling itself to you over and over , all the way through , using slick commercial-style editing and glossy close-ups of jiggling breasts . The story is wafer thin ( I honestly can 't think of another film I 've seen with less plot ) and it never makes much sense , but its a very contrived , calculating movie , so it feels consistent . People say it 's dated but Flashdance was always rubbish . Viewers in the early 80 's knew it was just cheesy T & A but it does work in its own silly fashion . There 's soppy romance for the chick-flick crowd and stacks of oily , writhing female bodies for their dates , all set to a pumping disco beat . How could it fail ? It helps that the dialogue is pointless , so you can grab a popcorn without missing anything major and , if this sort of thing isn 't your cup of tea , you can always laugh at the ' interpretive dance ' on display . The scene where a stand-in for Jennifer Beals convulses / ' dances ' on stage in front of a TV with a fan in it and a face full of white clown make-up had us in stitches . A genuine guilty pleasure . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Not too good a movie . Sure , it contains action , but the effects aren 't all that good for a ' 08 movie . Gunshot effects are downright horrible . Acting is " " meh " " It is nothing like Far Cry , other than names and the very basics of the story ( genetically enhanced super soldiers going amok ) . The super soldiers are very different , the mercenaries are different , the setting are completely different ( tropical island in the pacific in the game , island in northern-ish America in the movie ) .I loved playing Far Cry .

" The story idea is excellent . Unfortunately , the execution lets it down.The movie lacks pace , for one thing . It should be an exciting ride , but it is slow and more than a little boring.I think the problem 's mainly in the screenplay and editing . There aren 't enough obstacles and reversals to ratchet up suspense , and there are scenes which don 't really move the story along very effectively.The producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite . Unfortunately , when the producer is also the writer and the director , this evidently ain 't gonna happen.Much of the acting seems kind of flat , and that is down to the director - all the actors have been quite competent in other projects.It 's a shame , because with better writing , editing and direction , this could have been a really good thriller . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you like films that are totally bizarre , then this one is for you ! Abdullah is one mean mother , with a passion for strangling people and eating ham .

If you get bored of the film half way through you should persevere , just for the sake of seeing the aliens , which are nothing more than little toy robots , but in my opinion are the films highlight .

I was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production.But it turned out to be the the biggest let down . A far cry from the whimsical world of Dr Seuss . It was vulgar and distasteful I don 't think Dr Seuss would have approved.How the Grinch stole Christmas was much better . I understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on . Whereas The Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than I would have liked.Growing up with Dr Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .Lets see what they do with Horton hears a who.I hope this one does Dr Seuss some justice . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations . I had seen Jacquet 's previous movie ( march of the penguins ) and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio . However , I was severely disappointed . Most of all , this movie is terribly boring . Literally NOTHING happens . I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend , and we both ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like " " well then the winter comes , and then spring , and then there 's an eagle , and a river , and one time it is dark , and the girl goes into a cave , and another time the fox has babies " " and so on . After about half an hour I began sighing , yawning , rolling my eyes , cursing the reviewer at the radio station , and hoping that it would be over soon . But the movie went on and on . When it finally ended I had sunken so deep into my chair that I must have looked somewhat similar to Stephen Hawking . The most annoying parts of the movie are ( a ) The girl , who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with . She wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie ( one year ) , and shows exactly two facial expressions : Joy and Seriousness . She is cute , no question about that . However , a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all-too-human presence . I found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear , drown in the river , or something similarly terrible . ( b ) The commentary by the girl 's adult voice , which tells us nothing but negligible , obvious , boring , redundant things . ( c ) The music , which is desperately lacking subtlety . When the girl is happily jumping around , the music jumps around , too . When the fox is threatened by an eagle , the music becomes threatening , too . It reminded me of the very early days of film-making , and was just too predictable to enjoy . Admittedly , many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it , at least they got somehow involved . Thus , my warning concerns adults only : If you are over ten years old , avoid this movie . You can get a better ( and cheaper ) sleep in most other places . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In Sudan , the Arabs rule and are constantly at war with the Christians and Animists who inhabit the southern portion of this East African country . This film follows a group of of Dinka boys , a tribe of cattle herders , whom were left orphaned after their village was destroyed and their families killed in a brutal attack carried out by the Arab forces . Most of these boys are now teenagers and have been dubbed " " The Lost Boys " . " The filmmaker follows a group of the " " Lost Boys " " on their journey , as they have been accepted as refugees in the US , where they will land in Houston . Those who 've been accepted as refugees gain celebrity status , as they feel ( from what they 've heard ) that America is amazing . Making a trip from Sudan to America is like " " making a trip to heaven " " says the one young man . A huge party is thrown for their departure , and they are told to do Sudan well , and once they have been educated , to return to Sudan so that they can contribute to Dinka society . They are also warned not to be like " " those with the baggy pants " " whom are responsible for the negative stereotype of Black men , and also , no matter what happens , not to forget the Dinka culture.You watch as the boys come from a third world country into America and how they attempt to integrate into American society , as they have gone from a place with practically nothing to this plentiful world where everything is massively overproduced and overconsumed . They are taught about cleanliness and how to use all the utilities that we take for granted on a daily basis . It is humorous at times , humbling at others.Listening to the comments they make about Black Americans and American society / culture are quite interesting . As the film progresses you see how American culture begins to corrupt their previously humble ways of thinking.One of the boys , Peter , is not content with working and making just enough to survive , so he up and moves from Houston to Kansas City so that he can pursue an education . When the other boys visit him , they talk about how they cannot get into any schools . The main reason they came to America was to get an education and the media is saying that the boys have been brought from Sudan for an education . This is occurring because the boys were given arbitrary ages , making them older than they actually are , preventing them from being able to enroll in high school.The film juxtaposes images from Houston to Kansas . We watch as Peter enrolls in school , where he befriends a group of Christian conservative kids , and as Santiago attempts driving school ( even though he drives without his license anyways ) , and works at Walmart . We see Peter struggle with high school life as he strives to make his schools basketball team , and as Santiago has trouble keeping up with work , the rent , appeasing tensions back home in Sudan , and most of all , coping with loneliness.It comes to the point where the boys want to return to Sudan , and tell them that everything they are taught about America there is lies . " " You must make it alone here , do everything alone " " one of the boys says . A damning message to a Liberal Capitalist lifestyle , showing how it causes people to become radical individualists ( a trend which led to the creation of both the neo-conservative and radical islamist movements ) . Their biggest beef with America though , is that there is no time ; time is money and we don 't waste a second ! Despite all this , the boys never lose their sense of Dinka culture . They celebrate Southern Sudan Liberation Day , which marks the day which the SPLA began to fight in Sudan , a fight which continues today . They also meet with other " " Lost Boys " " on the anniversary of their arrival in America , where they discuss their experience in America as compared to back in Sudan . When asked , one boy says that if he were able to make a living he would much prefer to live in Sudan . It is much too lonely in America he adds . They never lose their sense of community , which has been conditioned into them as part of their culture ! This film makes us question the way we live , makes us question the artificial happiness that materialism and the nature of our societies has created within us . It will also change the way I look at refugees , I will never again take for granted how hard they must work and what immigrants mean for a country such as my own , Canada . This is a wonderful film . I laughed , I cried .. a very emotional journey , and a very well made documentary . 10 out of 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie stinks . I don 't think I have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value . The plot was relatively interesting , but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland . This could have been an a good movie . I think it just relied on it 's grotesque visuals . I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos , but it felt like Miike shot it for the sake of shooting it . Just one poorly executed film . There just isn 't anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest , pedophilia , necrophilia , rape , self milking , parental and sibling abuse , and fecal dispersement .

" An interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus . ( but done several times by now ) Overall the movie is too long and drags a bit . The editing could have been tighter . I am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits . Maybe the movie was rushed to market . The lighting was too dark in places . But the worst technical problem is the audio . The level was good enough to hear the dialog , but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them , which is very distracting . Either they were not careful in the recording , or the sound mixing could have been better . Also too much background noise got through . The should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes . The tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle . Especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter.Also the acting was a bit flat . I am sorry , but when I see that the same person writes and stars in a movie , in my experience it is a red flag.But it was a good effort so I gave it a 4 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people , two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah . It is really just another film about some beautiful , rich people trying to decide who they should bed next ; the peasants and naxalites and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop . Literally , as we don 't hear the villagers say a word , never mind learn anyone 's name , thus they occupy the same ' role ' as the ' natives ' in old Hollywood films . The movie is also dull , and the story does not actually get us anywhere - except to various bedrooms . We are apparently supposed to admire the artsiness of it all , which merely means no good song and dance routine , which would not have saved the film of course , but might have at least alleviated the boredom.My friend Japna was annoyed at the immorality of the whole story , not the bedroom bit but the whole pointlessness of the story .

Would be graduate has an idea . He wants total control . So he writes , directs , produces , his cinematic masterpiece all by himself . Usually , his concept is far beyond his budget . Usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with . Usually , he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes . Usually , he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it 's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget . Usually , he ends up with a series of encounters ( we cannot do justice by calling them scenes ) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old . And usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer . When you look at Judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it 's just the usual fare . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I did have some expectations from this film because 1 . It was a Yash raj production 2 . When the songs were first shown on TV , they seemed catchy 3 . The star ( ? ? ! ) cast was new . Well , I must tell u that I just couldn 't sit through this movie . Uday , ( with his red lips-what were the make up artists thinking ? ? ? ! ) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably . I won 't even get started on his acting ( if u can call it that ) . ' Cleavage queen ' Tanisha with all her screaming and ranting n raving just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration . I think Uday was slightly more tolerable than her ! She seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister . The story is pathetic ... the same old tried and tested formula .

Kronk is a lovely character , being good hearted and dumb all at once , but it were Pacha and Kuzco in drag that woke me up at the end of the movie .

The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role . You can see the plot points a mile away .

" Well , I 'd be lying if I said that this could easily rival Spiderman or the Batman movies . Still , it was more appealing to me for it 's moral value . I first bought the VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite . My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie , " " Hollywood Shuffle " . " True , he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable , but his movies are still fun.Meteor Man provides a hero with an Urban Contemporary feel . I always felt that , if there were superheroes , they wouldn 't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics . Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems : Car broken into , bad neighborhood , local drug-dealing gangs using children for distribution , etc . The scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community.What I found to be truly entertaining , outside of James Earl Jones ' " " young forever " " performance , was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers . It wasn 't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him , without his input , of course . It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived.Yes , the plot was weak , the movie was predictable , there was bad acting and continuity was rotten , but it ranks # 1 with my kids . Robert Townsend works to bring movies " " home " " so to speak . I doubt he 'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor / producer / director he truly is , but there are and will always be , those that love him for his efforts.One point to ponder about the film , which I find amusing : Throughout the entire battle with Simon , no one bothered to call the police ? ? ? ? Also , what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window ? My mother would have been right there , scrapping by my side , toe-to-toe . Dad would be loading his pistol. lolRent it and check it out .

Great job with the cameos Robert ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow , I just finally managed , after several attempts , to finish watching this god awful movie , only to learn that Rick Sloane and his production team have completed a straight-to-video sequel this year.Of all movies reviewed by MST3K--and they truly dig from the bottom of the barrel , screening the reputationally bad ' Manos , ' ' Werewolf , ' ' The Incredibly Strange , ' and the lesser know disasters like ' Laserblast , ' ' Zombie Nightmare , ' and ' Time Chasers , ' --this certainly has to be the absolute biggest pile of garbage they 'd ever shown ( which makes it perfect for riffing ) . Very simple , the movie is about a bunch of Munchies-like gremlins on the loose , exploiting people 's desires for fame , fortune , prowess , and of course , sex in ways that end up with people getting killed . But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous ( a test of machismo , for example , is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools ) , the writing is so forced ( such as the oft-described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it , if only she turned her head a quarter to the left ... and this isn 't the first time in the movie this happens ) , and the story is so ... rarely given attention ( hence the MST3K riff about a " " law in the future where films have to be made by FILMmakers ) , that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen .

" The worlds largest inside joke . The world 's largest , most exclusive inside joke.Emulating the brash and ' everyman ' humor of office space , this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books . The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary , and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist.The entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time , listening to music and writing a novel while working . These are his goals . You can 't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when ( around halfway through ) they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria , but then gives it UP ! The director and screenwriter ( Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth ) completely remove the audience 's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof.Apart from that major stumbling block , the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen . Without these asides , the audience wouldn 't have noticed anything particularly strange . Humor is only effective if it doesn 't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" These days , Asian horror films are among the best in the world , noted for their atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society . This is not one of those films ! Instead , " " The Record " " is a mediocre slasher movie highly derivative of American movies like " " I Know What You Did Last Summer " " and " " Scream " . " The plot is familiar - 5 teenagers accidently commit a terrible crime , but cover it up swearing to secrecy . One year later , they 're being stalked by a knife-wielding maniac ( with the decidely unscary disguise of a hospital sterile mask and an orange jumpsuit ) . It doesn 't help that the teenagers are a generally unlikable group ( this is one of those movies where the killer 's motives seem pretty reasonable ) and there are numerous stupid plot setups to keep the story going . The direction of the movie is unsubtle , more influenced by MTV than by current Asian horror films ( like " " The Ring " " ) .

" ( There Are Spoilers ) Usual slasher film with the story taking place in and around this God-forsaken mine outside the almost deserted town of Sutterille . After receiving a letter map and gold nugget from her brother Jared , Shadrach Smith , Clair and her husband Nick Breman , Carrie Bradac & Sean Hines , drive to the village together with four other friends and armature gold-prospectors Alx & Tori , Steve Wastell & Sangie , and Hayden & Rox Ann , Rick Majeske & Elina to stake their claim . It later turns out that the fact that Jared disturbed the long-forgotten gold mine caused the ghost of the notorious Jeremiah Stone , Vernon Wells , to come back to life and with that restart his reign of terror . Stone , or 49er , is about the most ridicules slasher / killer in motion picture history . Stone looks like he was buried for years under a few tons of coal runs around with this hook slicing people in two . After doing in almost the entire cast local hermit Aunt Nelly , ( Karen Black ) , who 's daughter Eve ( Alexandra Ford ) was also one of Stone 's victims , tells those still alive that unless they return the gold back to the Stone mine the crazed miner will never rest until he kills all those who still have it.Aunt Nelly is given just enough time to tell her story before she 's turned into a human torch by Stone and ends up jumping into a nearby stream.The movie goes on endlessly with the killer miner on the rampage looking like he 's about as scary as burnt toast and just as dark . Even those in the film seemed to show no real fear of him . In one scene when he broke into Aunt Nelly 's house everyone inside all charged , instead of running away , him causing the ghost miner to lose his right arm ; Stone spent the rest of the movie with a miner 's pick attached to his " " stump " .

" An in-name-only sequel to John Carpenter 's Vampires , this movie takes place in Thailand and involves a sect of bad vampires , who enjoy killing people , and a sect of good vampires who do not . While it 's an interesting idea to set a vampire film in Thailand , the writers don 't seem to do a lot with the exotic locale . This film could just as easily have been set in Los Angeles . Which brings me to my next point , which is that this seems a lot like Blade Lite . We 've got the rock soundtrack , the martial art battle scenes , a dance club bloodletting and , of course , lots of sharp objects going through vampires . What we don 't have is the budget and talent . Yes , the hero is a good martial arts fighter , too bad his acting wasn 't as good , and there 's plenty of decent wire work , and tons of revved up fight sequences , maybe too many . The problem is they just don 't have the same impact as the ones in any of the Blade films . Perhaps it 's just that the film has a " " been there seen that " " feel to it.However , for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn 't take enough time to establish the relationship between the lead , played by the buff and bland Colin Egglesfield , and his girlfriend . She gets snatched at the very beginning of the flick after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend . We have no vested interest in her welfare at this point and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her . Now that 's a major drawback when that 's the major thrust of the plot.In the end , you could do worse than waste 85 minutes of your time with this , but I can think of a lot better things to do with your time , like renting any of the Blade movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Dietrich Bonhoeffer 's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a Christian , and I eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life . Words can hardly express my disappointment . This movie was disjointed ... it gave no background about his life , no historical context , and nothing about his great writings ( except a brief , passing reference to " " The Cost of Discipleship " " by a colleague at the beginning of the movie . ) Instead , we see him enjoying jazz ( apparently in the States ) and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to Germany . Apparently to show his human side . OK , I 'm ready for the dramatic part . The part where he stands up for his faith . Instead of emphasizing that , we get a very badly acted romance with a 17-year-old schoolgirl . Whether or not that actually took place , it should not have been a major portion of the movie . Now ... still waiting for the dramatic part , or some narration explaining what his writings were all about ... or SOMETHING to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man. drum-roll ..... waiting ..... .... waiting .....

" John Madden 's cinematic interpretation of Edith Wharton 's Ethan Frome falls short of doing justice to a great literary piece . While the story is maintained the elements that give the novella its soul are skewered and all in all lost in the film . Madden fails to convey the innocence , and overall tragedy of Ethan and Mattie 's relationship instead transforming it into a morality tale . The mark is missed and the point lost in added details and poor dialog . Zeena ( Zenobia ) in the book is almost completely the antagonist , the books least sympathetic figure , where in the movie she can be almost pitied though it 's a stretch you kind of feel bad for this sick woman who is being cheated on . The book more accurately describes Zeena 's tyrannical control of the house and of Ethan . The movie just ticked me off . The addition of the fox was pointless , as well as the scene with Mattie trying to kill herself . It was just poorly interpreted and done . Film mistakes : Ethan 's elusiveness in the church dance scene , interactions with Denis Eady , addition of love scene , fox scene , store scene , saying his plans allowed , lack of displays of Ethan 's inner emotions and thoughts , introduction of the priest instead of nameless engineer , let on to much that Zeena knows about the growing relationship where in novel reader never knows what Zeena is thinking or aware of . Just too many flaws and poor directing decisions . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I suggest if you have already seen the original American Graffiti , do not see this movie . If you haven 't seen the original , I still don 't recommend this , but it will be a lot less painful to watch . The characters from the first film are great , and by the end you fell a connection to them . This movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become . It 's a chore to watch ! Set on New year 's eve in 1964 , ' 65 , ' 66 and ' 67 , we have four stories about the characters from the first film . In ' 64 , we have John Milner ( Paul Le Mat ) who is now a professional drag racer . He meets a foreign girl Eva , and though his plot really goes nowhere , it 's the best of the four . In 1965 , we have Toad ( Charles Martin Smith ) who is stuck in Vietnam , and more than anything , he wants out . He tries to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get out . In ' 66 , we have Debbie ( Candy Clark ) , the girl who Toad picked up in the first movie . Now she is a pot smoking hippie , and really I 'm not sure what her plot was about . It was her going to a concert ... not much of anything happened . Finally , in 1967 , Steve Bolander ( Ron Howard ) and Laurie Bolander ( Cindy Williams ) are having marriage problems that end in a anti-war rally and police action.None of these stories are very good . The script in some parts features very , very bad dialogue . These poor characters who I enjoyed so much in the first film , ended up where they are here ... why ? Why was this sequel made ? I guess if a sequel was made , it had to feature the Vietnam war , and hippies and police action , but the real thing is that this movie shouldn 't have been made.The direction was stylish , but it just amounts in a huge headache . Each story has a different style . Milner 's is just a regular ( depending on how you watch it ) wide screen , and is filmed how the rest of the movie should be . Toad 's plot was shot in 16mm , and what it amounts to is a poor looking picture , which is the size of a small box in the middle of the screen . Debbie 's plot is shot in multi-screen . At one point there might have been one screen , but for the good majority , it 's anywhere from two to twenty screens up at once . Don 't bother trying to follow the screens , since there 's nothing going on anyways . Steve and Laurie 's plot has the weirdest filming style . It 's style really doesn 't mean anything , and is dumb and pointless . Instead of just a full widescreen , it 's a condensed widescreen that looks like a full screen version of widescreen . Though I don 't like the others , at least I understand what they were going for , this one just doesn 't make sense.The music is this movie 's saving grace , not that it could save this ! Bob Dylan , Simon and Grafunkel , Stevie Wonder , Marvin Gaye and dozens of others have nice songs featured here . They don 't save the feature , they just make it a little better than it is . It 's still bad ! Overall , this is a pointless sequel . Any fan of the original should avoid this lackluster sequel ! My rating : * 1 / 2 out of * * * * . 110 mins . PG for language , drug use and violence , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes . The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking ( through the jungle , up a rocky cliff , near a river or lake ) to pad out the running time . The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging , bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb . Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing , gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras . For a zombie / cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn 't see an uncut version . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well since seeing part 's 1 through 3 I can honestly say that they should have NEVER made part 4 . Everything from the tacky , and I DO mean tacky score to the really bad acting , I dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds.I mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of Damion , but without him around in this one it 's just not the same . Sure by the end of part 3 I was getting a little tired of the continued story line 's , but it was a good closure at the end of the third one . Again there was no reason for a part 4 .

" This is " " realism " " ? If Rivette was seeking to give us a ground-level study of a woman in a certain place and time and how she was able to influence ( and was influenced by ) the world around her , he has failed miserably . Most prominently because we never get a clue as to why thousands of men would have followed her into battle . There is certainly not enough exposition of the cultural / historical context to define the country 's need for such a savior and , god knows , there is nothing particularly charismatic about Joan as she is presented here . Unless Bonnaire 's wooden posturing and flat line readings are supposed to indicate transcendent faith and determination . The use of landscape is particularly uninspired - we never lose the feeling we are watching twentieth century actors wandering in a supposedly medieval landscape . And as for the battle scenes ( which , in contrast to some commentors claims , do take up a good 15 % of screentime ) - they look like look like some some History Club from your local high school recreating a medieval siege , although the kids would no doubt put more passion into it . I will give Rivette credit , however , for picturing a side of Joan left out by other movies : that of a petulant , naive , and narcissistic adolescent ( played by a woman all too clearly at least twice the age of the character she is supposed to portray ) obviously unable to understand her place within the movement she is helping to create or the world existing outside her own passions . Joan 's outrage at her own soldiers swearing and astonishment at the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience to her are jarringly spontaneous and believable notes ( you suddenly realize such moments must naturally have occurred ) in an otherwise uninvolving historical " " representation " . " Unfortunately they also serve to point out precisely what is not addressed on screen -what made Joan SPECIAL ? I must say I also continued to be puzzled and frustrated by certain foreign film lovers who equate tedium and lack of dramatic involvement with " " artistry " " and " " seriousness " . " Does this film really increase our understanding or involvement with the subject ? Or with anything for that matter ? 4 / 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm sorry folks , but these enthusiastic reviews on this prestigious site about this movie " " Respiro " " are very strange , to say the least . Is craziness picturesque , I ask and didn 't find an answer . Of course , the movie is beautifully filmed , at part it 's almost a documentary . But then , the fact is that when it comes to the women Grazia , she shows every sign of a deep illness and I was wondering throughout the movie what the heck she has . Her behavior is absolutely worrisome and the ( shocked ) citizens of the village are very right indeed in wanting to send her off to a proper institution to see what can be done about her condition . She needs treatment , urgently ! Behaviour like hers is inferno to everybody around her , her husband , the poor children ( especially ) and the fellow citizens . Let 's not be falsely romantic about this ! I hated this condoning portrait of a mentally ill . WHY , for God 's sake , should the husband not want to have her cured or at least try to do this ? Why the horror of going to Milan ( a big city , sure , but lots of possibilities of capable persons to cure her ) ? Narrowmindedness ? Irresponsibility ? Anyway , I inspired myself on this site for renting the movie on DVD and after seeing it I HAD to post this for others to make themselves an opinion on it .

" The Governess was , by far , a very pitiful film . I do not use this word loosely , as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie . I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind 혚 " " why " " ? Honestly , you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit . There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development ( both in the story and in the characters ) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation . Scenes would occur with no foreshadowing , understanding , or drive to a complete ending . It was as if I was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution . Actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved . This was my biggest issue with this film . The complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine " " ripple-effect " " being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result.Let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film . I would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it . It made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all . Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this deed . Her character 's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent . She would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister , but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time . She has her first moment of passion in this film , and there is no pain or excitement . It nonchalantly happens , and this just didn 't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister . She is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson 's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention ? That was confusing and completely random . Is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non-existent . Anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn 't teaching Cavendish 's daughter anything . The sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers nearly had me laughing out loud . I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this film as Rhys-Meyers literally " " poofed " " into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama . It felt that the director ( or writer ) was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast , so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit ( or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts ) . Well , it didn 't fool me , I saw that he was nearly a " " cut-and-paste " " character used to strengthen an already weakened story . Don 't get me started on the ending , which had no consistency to the rest of the story . Again using the " " cut-and-paste " " method , the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story , and this was the only solution they could arrive to . It is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character 혚 but I guess that is the name of the game in Hollywood . Fix until completely broken , or at least salvageable.The remainder of the story was unexciting dribble . There were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent , period piece music , but nothing to write to Grandma about . More family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more , but as I stated before , by leaving open-ended scenes just lying around the entire film , you will experience a crack in your foundation . What may seem like a sturdy story , will eventually wear down over time , and by the end of this film I felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me . Wilkinson plays his normal self in this film , while Driver apparently did not want to get naked , but everyone else had too ( I will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes 혚 eeewwww ) . Also , she wore the same dress everyday . That was disgusting and I could smell her through the television . Sex and dirty laundry . Now there is a great film for you ! There just seemed to be some potential floating around here , but instead it was just rubbish . Nothing was answered , questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska , and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme.Overall , this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together , but instead it was just pitiful . I cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre-explanation . I don 't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child , but something should have been done to build a foundation . Just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used . If you were as confused about that as I was , then you will completely understand the film The Governess , while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal 혚 then , maybe this film is for you !

" I 'd never thought that I would be caught saying this : But I think " " Dog the Bounty Hunter " " is more entertaining than this 90 's era cop drama . Walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of " " High Octane " " cop shows such as CSI , CSI : Miami , and so forth . I 'm not saying all these shows are bad , but they aren 't good either . I like the karate chop action that Walker dispenses on the enemies of justice , and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the CSI series . But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this . Stereotypes / Countertypes ! That 's right , Stereotypes / Countertypes ! Unfortunately , this is a show for the moderates of Red State America who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime . For example , there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into Dallas where he encounters group of kids in Goth / Punk clothing and they start harassing him . Now ! This is exactly what Middle America perceives the Goth / Punk culture . I mean come on , how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business . Whenever there are Blacks and Latinos in the plot it 's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood . Okay ! Not everyone who 's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime , drugs , poverty . Again , this is what Middle Red State America sees of these people .

" CORRIDORS OF BLOOD Aspect ratio : 1.66 : 1Sound format : Mono ( Black and white ) London , 1840 : Whilst attempting to formulate an anaesthetic solution , a dedicated surgeon ( Boris Karloff ) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers.Riding the coat-tails of a Gothic revival occasioned by the recent success of Hammer 's THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN ( 1957 ) , Robert Day 's CORRIDORS OF BLOOD is an odd mixture of historical drama and Grand Guignol theatrics . Producer Richard Gordon lured Karloff away from Hollywood - where his movie career had become stalled in a B-movie rut ( VOODOO ISLAND , FRANKENSTEIN 1970 , etc . ) - for a couple of lurid shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control . In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER ( 1958 ) , he played a novelist who stumbles onto a horrific secret whilst researching a series of murders from recent history , while in CORRIDORS OF BLOOD , he 's a drug-addicted surgeon who falls prey to a gang of criminals masterminded by East End pub landlord Francis de Wolff . Less a horror film than a melodrama with ghoulish trimmings , the movie hedges its commercial bets by including a number of gory thrills ( a leg sliced open , a face destroyed by acid , etc . ) , but the narrative is motivated chiefly by Karloff 's altruistic pursuit of an anaesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery.Produced under the title ' The Doctor from Seven Dials ' , the finished movie went unreleased until 1962 due to indifference by distributors MGM , by which time co-star Christopher Lee had earned a prominent screen credit , despite playing a small - but significant - role as ' Resurrection Joe ' , a sinister Cockney thug who murders carefully selected patrons of de Wolff 's squalid pub and sells the remains to local doctors . Lee filmed this glorified cameo before THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN catapulted him to international stardom , which accounts for his limited screen time , though his intense performance is one of the film 's highlights . Adrienne Corri ( VAMPIRE CIRCUS ) distinguishes herself as de Wolff 's partner in crime , and there 's a feast of familiar faces in supporting roles , including Francis Matthews ( DRACULA : PRINCE OF DARKNESS ) , Betta St. John ( THE CITY OF THE DEAD ) , Finlay Currie and Nigel Green .

" After waking up at 3 : 30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep , I decided that I may as well be entertained while I suffered from sleep deprivation . This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it . What a mistake ! Here is the plot ( potential spoilers , if you even care ) : a neurotic man with an addiction to candy ( Josh Kornbluth ) works as a temp for some ridiculous company . Suddenly , he is offered the chance to " " go perm , " " which seems to be the favorite catch-phrase of this movie . But with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp , Josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn 't want to do it . He hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt . His inability to send several " " very important " " letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious , but is merely stupid . Josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together ( obviously a fantasy of Josh 's in real life , as such a thing would never happen ) . A bunch of other stuff happens , but it 's too trite and inane to go into now.Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy , I only laughed twice during it ; the first time was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth ( my initial reaction was one of stifling fear ) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman ( yeah , right ) . Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying-looking person I have ever seen in my life . He is an unattractive , overweight , balding Jewish man who I am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women . I do not at all sympathize with Josh 's character .

" A truly , truly dire Canadian-German co-production , the ever-wonderful Rosanna Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term " " problem child " " - a few uears prior to the " " action " " the child murdered her father , and mum took the fall for the offspring . Now she 's moved up to the Northwest US to start over , but her child still has a problem in that she 's devoted to her mother . So devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bond.Unfortunately Mandy Schaeffer ( as the daughter ) murders more than people - she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie , though the incoherent script , useless direction and appalling music ( check out the saxophone the first time she displays her bikini-clad bod ) don 't help any ; we 're supposed to find her sexy and scary , but she fails on both counts . Almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing ( not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer don 't really convince as mother and daughter ) , all condolences to Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow , both of whom are worthy of far more than this , and both of whom ( particularly Rosanna ) are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this farrago.One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not since the three-hour " " Love , Lies And Murder " " ( from Two Short Productions ) has there been such a " " You must be joking " " credit . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The Patriot ( nothing to do with the Mel Gibson film of the same name ) came out Steven Seagal was still doing that ' saving the environment ' thing in his movies . Which is fine . But it doesn 't make for good action.When the plot ( ? ) of this film finally kicked in I saw the twist ( ? ) coming a mile off . Seagal 's anti-warfare , care-for-mother-nature stance is not very subtle . For a film that was originally going to debut in the cinemas it is shot very much like a TV movie despite some wonderful shots of the country by Dean Semler , the photographer of Dances with Wolves.Steven Seagal does like 1 fight scene in the entire film and it 's totally boring .

" I 've been willing to put up with a lot from late-spring / summer action fluff movies , but in general that 's been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff ( i.e. cool special effects , interesting plot twists , comic value , Steve Buscemi , etc . ) . This movie , however , had none of this . All that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of Eva Longoria 's cleavage ( an issue of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket ) . There is an embarrassing lack of plot , suspense , back story , character development , continuity , etc . I would get into specifics , but quite frankly I 've already-maybe willingly-forgotten most of the movie.The entire time I was in the theater , I was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on DVD . Save your money on this one , folks . Unless you really , really , really like Eva Longoria 's cleavage . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Obviously , someone was looking at catching onto the " " Blair Witch " " wave.This movie was set up like all the " " reality " " haunted shows that are popping up on TV lately ( and I must admit , I get a kick out of these ) , but this movie is MUCH cheesier ! Probably the first three-quarters of the movie is filled with the " " participants " " going through the house , WHINING . Give me a break ! Spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time . Any paranormal happenings are blatant setups . No strings , but too perfectly caught on camera to be real . The " " participants " " were not very likeable either . Two goofy guys who don 't take it seriously , one girl who scares at the drop of a hat , and the quintessential over-played " " paranormal " " person . Is this becoming the clich챕d- " " formula " " for a ghost movie ? I have to admit , the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension . They took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those 15 minutes . I admit , I spent that time pacing in the kitchen . I really wouldn 't recommend this movie to younger viewers , even if it is PG13.If you 're looking for some entertainment , if you don 't take it seriously , you will get a kick out of this movie . There 's tons of situations to make cracks about ! If you 're looking for an great story-line .. look elsewhere ; ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" T. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s , but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times , styles and fashions . He 's like stuck with the same old-fashioned film-making style.Actors are not bad , not good either . Anil Kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son , but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic . Rekha is good , but then - she 's always good , and here she 's nothing more than such . She makes the best of what she is given , but she always does that . In conclusion , nothing great at all . Raveena is OK , which means ordinary , not bad , not good , nothing.This film is melodramatic , occasionally stupid . Maybe it 's a delayed film ? Well , even then it still would be below standard . The script is terrible , the film is overdone , and the story goes nowhere . It feels like a film made in the early 1990s , but the script makes it look even older , the style is like from the 1950s.Don 't recommend , unless you 're a big fan one of the starring actors . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The hysterical thing about this movie is that , according to the director , it has difficulty finding a distributor in the U.S. because most of them that viewed it couldn 't reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of Christianity and American angst . The thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable.Because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone " " Godspeed " " this makes it a " " Christian " " movie ? One could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the " " Land of Plenty " " with all of its material excess , the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse . Plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe ? Plenty of useless homeless missions ? How about plenty of psycho Vietnam vets ? As a pill-popping delusional survivor of agent " " pink " " are we to think America is a " " Land of Plenty " " of paranoid patriots ? Maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients ? Certainly we don 't have plenty of people concerned about Palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film . Of course if you worked in a German homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how Europe is the " " Continent of Plenty " " when it comes to sophistication.Indeed I agreed with the title in the end as the United States is the " " Land of Plenty " " and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts , amateur acting and dispassionately directed films . Life is too short and one , even an American , doesn 't have " " plenty " " of time to waste watching this piece . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I had never heard of this one before the owner of my local DVD rental outlet mentioned it to me ; being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the U.K. , I decided to check it out . The film turned out be a dull , amateurish and ugly-looking ride ; the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time , whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept ! What ? 셲 worse , the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings . Soon , one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again ; another , still bed-ridden , is quickly disposed of ( after being forgotten for most of the duration ) . The heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house : a harridan of a bible-thumping mother ( cue horrendous overacting ) , her repressed ( and long-suffering ) daughter , and the latter ? 셲 weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests.Often resorting to dinner-table reminiscences by the man-hating mother ( as a means of filling in the dreary , to say nothing of unoriginal , backstory ) and which invariably develop into mother-daughter sparring contests , the film does have one ace up its sleeve ? ? the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious , but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film ( as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore ) or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is truly a re-make that should never have gotten out of the stable . It has two casts that are acting in entirely different strata . At the top of their game are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell . Every nuance of the Franks is in plain sight. at the rock bottom are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts . I cannot imagine how Schell and Plowright manage to play so well when Gilbert and Roberts are working their anti-magic . Gilbert ruins every scene she 's in . It 's like Father Knows Best in the Ghetto . She 's Ann Frank light . Her run at Helen Keller was thin but not awful . This is sacrilege . Doris Roberts makes Mrs. Van Damm merely annoying . She is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious , dissatisfied presence caused so much trouble in het Acherhuis . This needed to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered what it was like to voluptuous . Her weight is not the problem . Joan Plowright could have played this part beautifully . Roberts was on a career high when this was made , getting lots of press and many opportunities . Her performance here displays her weaknesses as an actress shamefully.James Coco and Clive Reville , have most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts , and , strong though they are , they are completely incapable of undoing the damage done by their partners . Reville is a wily actor capable of the kind of iconic performance given by Ed Wynne in the original film . He gets no support from Gilbert . She drain the color out of every scene . I 've read with dismay the comments by those of you who grew up watching this version , filled with attachment to these performances . It 's a lesson in how the version you see first attachs to you . It makes me reconsider my attachment to some inferior products I loved in my childhood . I encourage you to watch the original .

" don 't watch this Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda look out for this documentary and you will see facts and truth http : / / imdb.com / title / tt0283181 / The Death of Yugoslavia documentary series ( of five episodes ) is a painstakingly compiled and researched account of the extended mass-bloodshed which marked the end of the old Federal Yugoslavia and spanned almost the entire first half of the 1990 's . It includes a huge wealth of news footage and interviews with involved parties both " " Yugoslav " " and otherwise . The only real " " improvement " " which could be made to this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the Balkans since the program was made . This was indeed done in the late 1990 's for a repeat showing on BBC television , but the addition of some even more recent events would help to complete this admirably detailed and fulsome piece of work . Perhaps another whole episode might be warranted ? The very succinct title of this documentary was made all the more appropriate by the eventual abandonment of the term " " Yugoslavia " " by the now-named Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a much belated and formal admission of that which occurred years before.not fiction like in " " Yugoslavia : The Avoidable War ( 1999 ) " " , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
I too am a House Party Fan ... House Party I is my favorite movie of all times . House Party 4 is a disgrace to all of the HP 's and to Kid n Play ... This was supposed to be part of a series really .. there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans .. yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a House Party movie b / c its kind of focused on teens .. but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance ... you can tell how good it was b / c it didn 't even make it to the movie theaters . Immature was in House Party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy ... but they should have represented right ... they should have left it at House Party 3 .

" Blake Edwards tried very hard to change Julie Andrews image in this film . He tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was . I think they were both still a bit irked that Julie had not been chosen to film her Broadway success of Camelot and was passed over as not being sexy enough . Unfortunately , they chose this vehicle to try and assuage this belief . It gets to the point where it is almost funny seeing Rock Hudson , who we all know now was gay , kissing Julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie . It seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that Julie was a femme fatale but that Rock was straight . Sadly , they have absolutely no chemistry together and the unending kissing scenes start grossing one out . The other error they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making . It is almost three separate movies . There is the drama of Julie as the German spy trying to get military secrets from Rock . There is an air war movie with lots of footage of WWI vintage planes swooping about and there is the stupid attempts at humor that Blake Edwards seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not , In this case , it was not . The only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely Dame Julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell-like soprano . Of course if you love her , you may overlook the weaknesses of this film just because of her . You can always tell yourself , afterward , that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through STAR ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The film is a bit tedious . It 's mostly a silent film , with the bulk o the story provided through a series of voice-overs . While making a silent film like this is not such a bad idea , this is one of those films where the lack of dialog and the repetitive early scenes make it simply tedious . You don 't understand the reason for the tedium until well into the picture , and by then it 's too late . The first 40 minutes of film is something of a slow piece of Mexican soft porn , and unimaginative soft porn at that . Later in the film the style of the first 40 minutes starts to makes sense , but it 's too late , because by then the audience is lost . There is some nice location shooting at the National Autonomous University of Mexico . I 've often wondered why more films aren 't shot there . The campus is built on the edge of lava fields that lend the campus a very otherworldly feel . My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who doesn 't know the story will view it .

Decent acting , somewhat thought out plot , even if they are potboilers , and last but not least , directors who have a clue.All three were made by very competent directors , all of them took the films in a different direction , equally exciting.Redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch , and made them the extras , then picked up his leads from Hollywood 's unemployment line.And the script.Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theatre 3000 bad.This is 70 's made for TV movie bad.Yeah , the movie had a few cool cars , but you don 't really get to see that many in action , and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases , and if the cars aren 't thrilling you , why go to a movie like this ? Im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers , and I cant stop laughing out loud.Im getting dirty looks , but this was just a debacle.Rent the F & F movies.Go to Nascar Race.Go to a karting track and race yourself.Whatever you do , avoid Redline like bad cheese . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Both movies depict crucial events in chinese history , FMC in the 20th century and TA the first unification of the whole chinese nation in the 3rd century bc . FMC succeds with memorable characters , gorgeous cinematography , convincing sets , good acting and an interesting story . The Assassin fails on nearly every level ( okay , the sets are great , the cinematography is good , and the few battle scenes are quite exciting ) . But ... the pathos . Call me a cynic , but too much is too much . If you felt that Saving Private Ryan was too pathetic , be aware , this here will make you sick .

" A really very bad movie , with a very few good moments or qualities.It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair , who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks , I 'm not sure . She jumps through a window and wakes up , and we see she is very pregnant . The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie.She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island . Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies ! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend ( you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff ... ) . He 's taking photographs , and she 's translating an esoteric German book about witches , I think.Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it , and a real estate agent , and a woman I thought was their daughter . Evidently she was an architect , and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple 's children . I guess they all traveled to the island together , but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them ( maybe they were filmed separately ) .The hotel seems neat , certainly from the exteriors , but it isn 't used to any great effect . An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes , which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder.People start getting killed , either in their dreams , or sucked into hell or something . Some of these gore scenes are OK , but not enough to recommend the movie . Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover , the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut . Much of the scene is showing another character 's reaction shots , since we 're not seeing anything ourselves . The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone . He looked particularly nasty . There 's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed . I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her , they would do something original with her role , and let her leave Exorcist behind her ( except for the yearly horror conventions ) .In the weird , largely Italian , tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to , this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2 . That is , it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse , La ( 1988 ) - it 's not ( that 's also a better movie than this one ) . La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead ( 1981 ) and Evil Dead II ( 1987 ) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 ( and much better than those ) . There 's also a Casa 5 , La ( 1990 ) AKA House 5 , which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House : House ( 1986 ) House II : The Second Story ( 1987 ) , The Horror Show ( 1989 ) AKA House III , and House IV ( 1992 ) . How 's The Horror Show fit in there ? It doesn 't really , it claimed to be a sequel , thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less ( or more ? ) confusion . Oddly , The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House , and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2 . Does your head hurt yet ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" For most people , RoboCop 3 is the film that really is the big disgrace for the Robo series . It has few fans , and most people hate it for it 's shameless commercial PG-13 approach . Now , I 'm not going to say that RoboCop 3 is any good . Frankly , it pretty much sucks . But as far as being a properly shot and executed film , it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos . Yes , the truth of the matter is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a near-masterpiece . So what if RoboCop 3 turns Robo into a cartoonish super hero in a ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy - at least it 's doing it openly . I don 't know where RoboCop 2 begins and ends , I don 't know what or whom it 's about , I don 't understand what 's going on in it , I don 't understand which jokes are deliberate and which aren 't , I will go insane if I try to understand the characters , I see nothing of any value in anything anybody is saying , I can 't believe anybody looked at the shooting script and figured it would work and I can 't believe that Irvin Kirshner saw the finished result and figured that he liked what he see . He probably didn 't by the way , neither Miller , nor Weller nor Allen did . It 's not hard to see why.Now , RoboCop 2 has it 's fans , I know this . Mostly they belong to this league of absolute anti-pretensions , dismissing anybody who expected any depth , or subject matter from the first film , as academic Roger Ebert Sith apprentices . It 's just a lot of fun , a good piece of action and great entertainment , the argument goes . Yeah well , I guess if you just don 't listen to what any of the characters are saying you could fool yourself that we might as well have Arnold in the suit instead of Weller . Don 't get me wrong , I like a good action film , with pure entertainment value as it 's only - most satisfying - virtue . But RoboCop 2 , sir , ain 't no such thing.Look at the first couple of scenes . This horrible actor makes Robo repeat that he 's just a machine , and then goes into this operatic speech about how he could never be a man , where-after Murphy 's wife ( who 's suing OCP for robot-stalkings ) walks in out of the blue and have this sad little moment with him , and then is never heard of again ! I surely would like to go in to this film scene by scene , because every one has these kind of absurdities in them . It 's like a twelve year old fan boy has done the screenplay , the characters act totally random and first say this , then say that . OCP wants to stop crime with a new Robo , especially this drug called " " nuke " " but then it seems they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city 혯 politics are abandoned I guess , understandable given the comic relief mayor , The villain ( played by Tom Noonan , who did a better version of this in Last Action Hero and that 's saying a lot ) is an addict , but is still used for this machine . The woman behind it all has an agenda which is impossible to understand.Speaking of twelve year olds , this film has the infamous role of " " Hub " , " this mad kid who swears and kills people , played by a child actor . I 'm not going to be all moral about it , it 's a free world and if you want a psycho kid in your action movie , go for it . I don 't know how much of Frank Miller 's original vision was put into this , but the credits at least acknowledge him as conceiver of the " " story " . " And , if I zoom out , I could see this as being quite a cool character . It 's grim for sure , to have a maniac killer kid but then again this is the world of RoboCop and who would be surprised ? This whole business with the OCP trying to become this giant monopoly over everything , is properly dystopian and good as well . Also , the idea of RoboCop getting in touch with his wife and kid , having them embedded into the story somehow - would also be great , and as far as I can see a natural and logical step if they now had to make a RoboCop sequel.But , of course , these are just ideas . As many people have already said , the screenplay is 100 % mess . The kid has one scene ( the torture scene ) where it 's hinted that he in fact is just a stereotype messed up kid , and then we have this unimaginable scene where he is dying and gets all soft and friendly towards ol ' tin head . Why doesn 't he just take up his uzi and try to take him down with his last breath ? Isn 't that what his character would do ? Does he give his life a little second thought there on his death bed ? Not necessarily , given that his last words are " " it sucks " , " so why ? It really makes no sense , and this can be said about everybody , no everything , in this film . IS there a strike in the police force ? IS RoboCop machine or man ? What 's the deal with turning Robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes ? I mean , sure , it 's pretty funny I wouldn 't deny that . But why build it up , and then discard it ? And why the hell is Allen so criminally underused ? and what is it Weller has an obvious urge to express with his character and yeah , well , the threads are many and the mess is enormous.This review is just as messed up as the film . The only reason I give an extra star up there is because of the actors from the first film , I 'm sure they had good intentions with it .

" This movie is overrated , to say the least . It 's not good as a comedy , and it 's not good as a " " serious " " film either . The pacing is far too plodding for the former , and there is too much lame slapstick for the latter . The only laughs come from some of Bud Spencer 's reaction shots when he becomes exasperated by his brother 's behavior . The dubbing is excellent but the full-screen framing is appalling .

" This was one of Christie 's later stories . Throughout her long career , she was interested in the shifting narrative and the notion of conflicting agents . Both are essentially the same thing and boil down to questions of who it is that controls or creates the situation.In detective fiction , the game is a matter of conflicting realities . The murderer intends to change reality to fool the detective , the writer intends to do the same to the reader . Both the reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see . That 's why her stories often include a writer.In her works , she explores every combination of tricks she can think of that deal with this . Along the way , we often have bodies that are not who they seem , and times , and intended victims and such . But the real magic of the books is this notion of control . In ' Bertram 's ' it was literally a building.Here , it is a dead man . Well , sometimes that happens , but not like this . It is as if the writer were the famous Mr. Rafiel . This is particularly sweet to Marple readers who remember this same character from the ' Carribean Mystery , ' which in a way was also framed by her nephew . In that story , Rafiel was the conveyor of the story to the authorities.The producers of this series have an almost wacky commitment to using a different creative team on each one . Sometimes it produces bland work . The ' Bertram 's ' episode was rather brilliantly staged . This one is the most lavish of the lot , and has an active camera . But unlike the ' Bertram 's ' work , it has nothing to do with the story.The camera moves and captures merely because it can . The ' Citizen Kane ' quote at the beginning was a little too literal and blunt . This story is good , but the adapter took out some pretty critical stuff , and that irrelevant camera annoys.Ted 's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 : Has some interesting elements . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When a hardworking entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club , he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from Ty Webb ( Chevy Chase ) and turns it into a theme park / golf course in which everyone can join.This is by no means a good movie , but it is still slightly amusing at times . Almost all of the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for Chevy Chase . Chevy Chase plays one of his greatest roles as Ty Webb for a second time and plays it great . He is not only the funniest character in the movie , he is the only funny character in the movie . Even Dan Akroyd fails to bring humor to this film which aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy but falls to rubble with others shown on Comedy Central . The movie might have been better if Ty Webb ( Chase ) had a larger role but instead he was reduced to a minor character and the star became Jackie Mason ( Who ? ? ) They should have brought back all of the cast and made a sequel the right way ! This is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie . Overall , Caddyshack II is humorous but a large mistake.I do not recommend this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The only reason I remember this movie is because it was ( and still is ) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent . I was 17 and my friend was 18 . We were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most ( ok 2nd most ) . We walked out feeling so insulted , we wanted our money back , but the time could never be regained.The editing is what killed this movie . As the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in 4x4 VW Bugs shooting rockets at the truck . Please , rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium ? What 's worse is the these VW 's manage to get 15-18 shots off of a 4 rocket launcher . You would see on VW with 4 rockets fire 2 of them , cut around the truck with the last one attached , come back a second later with two rockets attached , fire another , then go in front of the truck and now it 's back to a full set of 4 rockets.We toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened . It looks like they just ran out of money and stopped.Just ridiculous . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie lacked credibility for two reasons . One , no mayor of a major city , and New York is certainly as major as it gets . Would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live ; especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security . All of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly , Jewish or defenseless . At 62-years of age , I have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did . Even " " Escape from New York , " " which was fictional , up front , i.e. they told you that this was science fiction , didn 't resort to such deep-seated violence . In this movie , most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them . Also , in this movie and I have not seen the prior two , is more lawless than the " " Escape " " movie . Secondly , gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be . On the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he 's killed . Yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers , the next gang over is welcomed with open arms . Outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped . We are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang , the other gangs want to be all into it . Why did the outside gangs come to help ? I believe that more than one gang from outside came to help . What did they come for ? Another question , why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack Bronson 's character ? This was not a great movie and I could go on , but I won 't . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just want to start by saying this is the first review of a film I have done on the net . I felt the need to warn people about this film because it truly is one of the worst films I have ever seen . After reading interviews with the director he says he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible.1. The actors . I know the budget may not have allowed for great thespians but with Nicholson working in the industry for over ten years surely he knew some actors who were at least average.2. The incredibly lame make up and special effects . Once again budget obviously interfered with what was originally intended but after working in make up for so many years there is really no excuse.3. The obvious similarities to Hostel . Whilst not being exactly a rip off it sure does try to cash in on the former films success . Only problem is Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there ... 4 . The music . Not at all creepy or haunting not even sickening just plain annoying.5. The script in general . All dialogue was forced and terrible ! Also the sub plots about the theatre and the guy who comes in to save them were weak as and almost like an afterthought.6. The editing . WTF . How jarring , and not in a good way. nuf said.Seriously I would like to hear the director 's thoughts on my post ( he no doubt frequents his pages on IMDb . ) cause buddy ... what were you thinking . Surely at some point during either the shooting or editing you realised what a turkey yolu had on your hands ... Sorry I don 't want to be harsh but you must have more talent than this i hope your next feature that gutterballs movie or wahtever is better , hopefully practice makes progress.But in the mean time avoid this like the plague . I want my 81 mins back with interest . ( At least I didn 't pay to watch it . ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I don 't think I 'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie I 've ever seen . I 've been working on a list of my favorite war movies : " " The Longest Day , " " " " To Hell and Back , " " " " Bridge on the River Kwai , " " ( all black and white ) which all have good plots , rich characters and great acting . I 've seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays . The plot , however isn 't a bad premise - just poorly implemented . It 's kind of like a traffic accident , though , I couldn 't seem to turn it off ! A movie doesn 't need big money or great sets i.e. " " Twelve Angry Men " " and " " Lifeboat " " to be good ... so budget is no excuse . What were they thinking ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you . Where is the absolute last place you want to hide ? I 'd say inside the uncanny Virgin of Nuremberg torture device , because there 's a good risk you 'll get brutally spiked to death . And yet , the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin . " " The Vampire 's Coffin " " is a rather disappointing sequel , as director Fernando M챕ndez doesn 't re-create the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957-original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs . No more ominous castles with eerie cobwebs and dark vaults , but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughs instead of frights . The story opens inside Count de Lavud 's final resting place , where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin in order to examine the corpse at a private clinic . Naturally the wooden stake gets removed from his heart , and the vampire count comes to live again , immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work . The vampire has his eye on a beautiful female patient at the clinic , and it 's up to Dr. Enrique Sald챠var to rescue her soul and to destroy the bloodsucker . " " The Vampire 's Coffin " " uses a limited amount of locations and there 's very little action . The whole film would actually be pretty boring if it weren 't for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances . The photography is amazing , though , with the sublime use of shadows and darkness . This is most notably during the scene in which Count de Lavud stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night . It 's the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film , the rest is fairly mediocre and d챕j횪-vu . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is really special . It 's a very beautiful movie . Which starts with three orphans , Sho , his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi , They 're poor children 's , living on the street , but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money , and then their able to live on , to buy a house , and their life seems to become much better . They 're making new friend , life-friends . But something went wrong and they 're becoming enemies and it all ends up with them killing each other.I was negative about this movie in the beginning , because when singers ( Gackt - Solo , ex-singer in Malice Mizer , Hyde - Solo , singer in L 'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel , both very famous in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer ) trying to become actors , but this isn 't like the other singers-going-actors-movies . They 're doing a great job , and with no earlier experience in movies ( except for Lee-Hom , who had been in two movies before ) .This is absolutely one of my favorite movies . Maybe that 's a little because I 'm a very big fan of Hyde , but - it was this movie who made me discover him.Well , Gackt ( playing the main character - the orphan Sho ) was a part of the group who wrote the script , and it was he who insisted that Hyde should play Sho 's friend , the vampire Kei . At that time they didn 't know each other , at least not like friends . But after the movie they became really good friend , and that shows us too that they really worked hard on this movie and that they had good cooperation.The movie have many different feelings running trough the story , Love , Hate , Sadness , Pain , Loneliness , Happiness and so on . I think the first hour are the best , it 's so beautiful . After that people are dying , Kei 's leaving and it all changes so much . But still it 's a great movie , it 's the only movie who has ever made me cry , it ends up so sad , but still beautiful.So if you haven 't seen this movie , you really should . Because it 's wonderful , but sad . You won 't regret it . ^ ^ , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies , when you put them together that 's my sweet spot : horrible sleaze . You 're not going to get it in this film , though.There is certainly sleaze , in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured , tied naked to various things . The sleaze isn 't very sleazy , though . It didn 't register very high on my sleaze meter , mainly because none of the girls were in the least attractive , nor did they attempt to act as if they were even threatened . They seemed to be thinking more about what was for lunch , or maybe when they could score some crack.Forget the effects , they were lame in the extreme . The lameness was contributed to by the bad acting ; effects are harder to believe when even the actors and actresses aren 't buying into them.Cinematography was pretty bad , they could have hired a couple cameramen from a porn movie and done better . In fact , that might have raised the sleaze factor enough to make it enjoyable . As it is , there are a lot of dark shots where you can 't see very clearly , and what you can see isn 't looking too good.The horror factor is nil . Null . Zero . Nada . Zip . Zilch . I 've seen kids movies that were more frightening . There 's no camp here , either . It 's just a movie that attempts to be shockingly sleazy , but doesn 't even come close . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Tasteless . I can 't even write intelligently about the movie . I laughed the entire movie . It wasn 't supposed to be funny . Matt Farnsworth has no clue what he is doing . His story is written , it seems , without any knowledge of Iowa culture and the meth problem . I know Farnsworth is from Iowa , which makes his movie even more puzzling to me . Why do the two main characters have accents ? It doesn 't make any sense . The acting was mediocre at best and at times hard to watch . Gratituous violence and sex filled the movie . I am guessing that the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy , but it came across as unbelievable and offensive . The ending of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all I could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief . As I walked out of the theatre everyone else who was leaving was laughing along with me . The ending of the movie was meant to evoke tears , but it did the exact opposite .

Of particular annoyance is a gigolo character from a 60 's Doris Day movie.The cast bleeds ketchup while the Chupacabra bleeds day green glow in the dark blood .

" Hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that 's wildly overhyped and underwhelming on a first-time viewing basis . Hannibal is bad , terrible , inept , lame , droll , idiotic , contrived , laughable and utterly atrocious ( no pun intended ) . Minor spoilers follow ... This movie has huge logic holes - more than any Bruckheimer / Bay movie - or for that matter - any movie that exemplify the indulgence of Hollywood exaggeration . It 's a slick Hollywood production designed to cash in on Hannibal Lector mania , directed by " " so-somber-he-takes-this-way-too-seriously " " hack director Ridley Scott and produced by a hack Italian producer with an inflated ego whose credo is " " doesn 't matter whether film is s * * t , money is good " . " I can 't get over the fact that acclaimed screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote this tripe adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good-novelist-turned-hack-author Thomas Harris . David and Steven - well-known and immensely talented screenwriters - wasted their effort on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat paychecks . Another factor in the disappointment of this film.There are too many ludicrous scenes to list that are laughable in clunky execution and poor logic e.g. Starling / Pazzi cell-phone in the midst of Lecter pursuit that turns up Inspector Pazzi as the victim . Not to mention laughably bad dialogues delivered by Tony Hopkins with a smirk and Julianne Moore , Ray Liotta and others who cannot act with the straight face . Hopkins gives the true meaning of " " scenery-chewing " " along with hammy acting by Gary Oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on exacting revenge against Lecter.The gore effect is good , but only serves to repulse rather than provide suspense which is notably absent from Hannibal . The predecessor - Silence of the Lambs - is more believable with tension and suspense . Suspense is what made Silence of the Lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller , not to mention superbly written and tensely directed . The " " brain dinner " " sequence is so laughably fake it borders on self-parody.The ending is kinda blatant and idiotic - are we supposed to believe that Lecter is still a menace to society with the last shot establishing his glittering eye glaring at you ?

" Sometimes intentionally campy , at other times unintentionally silly ( like in the opening scene , where a woman is " " informed " " that she has been raped and that her family has been slaughtered , just for the sake of exposition ) , this film is ultimately neither funny enough nor competent enough ( as a straightforward adventure story ) to be really enjoyable . I 'll leave you to decide which may be the highlight , but the low point is probably the fight with a silly metallic dragon . Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for Sonja , with her fresh face and her firm , slightly muscular body ( and I think that her dark-red hair suits her perfectly ) , but Schwarzenegger gives one of his few colorless performances as Calidor .

" Sheltered young woman , home-schooled and possibly quite gifted , harbors a disturbed , overly-emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit , asking for a divorce . Directed by celebrated cinematographer William A. Fraker , this ill-titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in : each shot is composed for the utmost style , but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight , gripping narrative . Fraker ( and his cinematographer , L찼szl처 Kov찼cs ) are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones , giving the picture a burnished , tableaux feel . The mansion at the center of the action looks like a funeral parlor , and Fraker paces the wheezing yarn just like a funeral . Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman ( as Shaw 's fianc챕e ) , two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s , manage to cut through the plastic overlay and are quite compelling despite the jagged editing ( which turns their scenes into little bits of half-realized business ) . Sondra Locke , another interesting screen personality , seems cast for her resemblance to Catherine Deneuve in " " Repulsion " . " Pale and saucer-eyed , with imposingly thick and long hair , Locke is a curious human puzzle , and she 's initially quite intimidating and dangerous ; however , this role is so old-hat that Locke can find nothing fresh to bring out of the deep freeze , and she flounders . Fraker allows Locke 's freak-out scenes to go on and on , while Shaw ( looking terrifically debonair ) is put in the impossible position of playing touchy-feely daddy to her . All of this nonsense might be worth slogging through if the screenplay had been peppered with a modicum of tangibility ( or , at the very least , some dry wit or humorous relief ) . As it is , Lewis John Carlino and Edward Hume 's limp script , adapted from Stanton Forbes ' novel " " Go To Thy Deathbed " , " strands the viewer early on , and only the charisma of the players gets us to the finish line . * 1 / 2 from * * * * , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The initial precept was promising , but in all respects afterwards it was totally awful . Let 's run through the main points . Plot - good initial idea but truly terrible development .

Characterisation - all of the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures . I keep trying to think of one that wasn 't - possibly the mother , but that 's it . Music - intrusive , inappropriate and generally terrible . Direction - totally amateurish . Cinematography - doubt they 've heard of it . Camera angles / stability / zoom levels often really bad .

" The Hazing is confused mumbo-jumbo that wants so hard to be The Evil Dead that it even references Bruce Campbell several times . The problem is , it is simply not in the same league as that terrific movie . This movie is nowhere near as original . The plot has been used before , by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons , and that was a lot more fun . This flick wastes too much time with complicated exposition before getting the kids into the spooky mansion and starting the demonic happenings.Brad Dourif is , as usual , not given much to do here , but when he is on screen he puts in another over-the-top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous . As for the acting of the kids , it 's passable but by no means good . The shaky camera work is more annoying than clever or atmospheric . There are a few good moments when the first guy gets possessed and throws around some deadly one liners while dispatching his victims , but it was never scary for a second . The gore level is mid-range to low , but the director tries to make up for it by showing the actresses topless a few times .

" OK , this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments , but there are a couple of items I wish to add . The mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf . If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that , fine . But the animal in the cage is a coyote . That would make a werecoyote . Did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote ? They 're easy to tell apart . That 's weak.Secondly , this movie was covered in the third episode of MST3k ( on the Comedy Channel ) . It took Joel and the bots a number of episodes to get up to full riffing steam , and they weren 't up there quite yet on this one . They DID add enough to this snoozer to keep you awake until the end , but it was not one of their better episodes . They never even mentioned the glaring omission of an actual wolf , and THAT joke was just hanging in the air waiting to be smacked . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" OK , so my summary line is a cheap trick . But the movie is full of them and it gets absurdly praised , so ... I caught this one on TV ( uncut , as TV here shows all movies , that 's for you Americans who might say I didn 't like it because I saw a cut TV version - fortunately that 's only an US thing ) , and had no idea about what it was . I switched on , caught the last minutes of a show , and the movie began .

I don 't even know why I didn 't switch channels ) . And , yes , in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy , albeit an unintentional one.Marina Zudina is pretty enough , but gosh , what a dreadful performance ! While casting a foreigner in the role is smart enough ( she doesn 't talk so bye bye language barrier ) , yet , sorry , Marina baby , playing mute doesn 't mean impersonating Harpo Marx . Her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments , just look at her when she draws an X in the air while stalked by the killer . He wants to kill you , it 's no time to play Zorro . We get plenty of " " running upstairs " " stuff passing for tension , as in the worst slashers , and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other . Ugh ! Will Hollywood ever learn ? Yet the best / worst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a bathtub and ... Well , I have never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub , but I 'm sure you can 't see the blue cartoon rays in real life , do you ? And how about immediately trusting a mean-looking guy because he SAYS he 's a cop , and not asking him to show you his credentials ? OK , so he turns out to be a real cop . But still , not asking for the badge makes no sense ( plot-wise , we could always think the credentials might be phony or he might be a crooked cop . Screen writing 101 ) . And how about the big twist ? Don 't tell me you didn 't see that coming from 200 miles away ... I feel sorry for poor old Alec Guinness and his useless stock footage cameo . Now I think about this , what 's the point in giving him a " " Mystery Guest Star " " credit ... in the END titles ? The movie 's over , there 's no mystery anymore , and everybody and their brother have identified Guinness ( even non-movie buffs will recognize " " the old guy from ' Star Wars ' " " ) . Yet better off this way , so we can pretend it 's not the late great actor.People keep comparing this to , of all people , Hitchcock . I suppose it has to be John Hitchcock the milkman , as the late Sir Alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this , let alone making it . And this gets a 6.8 / 10 ? ? ? ? It 's Bottom 100 material !

" There is an excellent reason Edison went straight to video : it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud . The movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring . Just a notch above lowbrow ( thanks to Freeman and Spacey , who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films ) , the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non-existent as Justin Timberlake 's acting . I hate to knock the guy , but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte , the better.The movie isn 't all bad ... just mostly . I like the fact that LL Cool J was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man . He deserves it . And , unlike his fellow musician and co-star , he can act . Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable as well ( you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery ) , and Freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars ( out of ten ... he 's not THAT good ) .When all is said and done , the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo-action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake .

What a mistake , the acting is a shambles , the special effects ( if you could call them that ) , look like something that wouldn 't be out of place at a school play . Some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen , which unfortunately is all to often . As for a story , forget it .

" Critics have started calling it the Oscar Winner club , understandably . What after Halle Berry won it for Monsters Ball then going straight to the diabolical Catwoman . Hilary Swank triumphs in Boys Don 't Cry and follows it with The Core . Jamie Foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the dull Stealth after scooping a gong for Ray . Now it 's seems Hollywood Starlet Charlize Theron craps all over her " " Monster " " Oscar with this one of the worst Sci-fi spectacles ever made.The film loses its audience interest after a mere 20 minutes meaning the only thing really worth staying for is the fact that despite the film being rubbish Charlize Theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a crude and laughable premise . Not only is 횈on Flux ultimately shallow but for an action flick it 's also really very dull . It will only really appeal to comic book fans and Horney teenagers who like the idea of Theron running around half naked for 90 minutes . Flux only really succeed in failing.Set against the 2011 virus that kills 99 % of the world 's populace , and in the last city on Earth , Bregna , the survivors , some four hundred years later , in the year 2415 , are continuing to live in the Goodchild dynasty , the name of the scientist who developed its cure.All is not well in this utopia and it is not what lies beyond its high walls that protects its citizens from the never ending jungle but what unspoken , unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unfortunates ' together that lies within these walls of paranoia , conformity and unquestionable obedience . Filmed in and around Berlin , ironically , this is a story set against a totalitarian state , a walled city , where its peoples are no longer capable of reproducing , and its sinister and most secret plot of how it sustains life.횈on Flux is the assassin that has been assigned by the underground rebels to change the course of Mankind , forever . This is the story of her fight for justice , freedom and revenge.횈on Flux combined lousy narratives , ropy pacing and truly dire effects . Looking more like an unrealistic video game rather than a film . The only thing that is fortunate about the failure is that no sequels are in the works , Flux might just be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history , thank god for the lousy box office takings then.My final verdict on this truly lousy feature ? There really isn 't a story here just Charlize Theron jumping around in a black suit like a grass hopper . The acting is very wooden moronic and emotionless compared to the other cinemas that are out there today . It try 's too much to be like an adaption and doesn 't really take much from the cartoon which is what I was expecting , the only thing that was done half right that pays tribute to the cartoon was the fly in the eye scene . Avoid at all costs . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably first ever written review of a film I 've done of my own accord - not for some class assignment . I think that fact alone says something about this movie ... not a good thing ! I am no seasoned journalist or critic ( though I have seen my fair share of movies ) , but I found this particular film so terribly painful to watch , it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience . Where better to do it than IMDb ? As I forced myself to sit through the movie , physically writhing from the inability to connect-the-dots , I was sure there would be some " " light at the end of the tunnel " " - a revelation to explain what in samhe.-.ll was going on . The movie ended and I was as enlightened as dog * * * * . After several rewinds to review certain scenes I still could conclude nothing sensible . I found myself wanting to yell " " Does this make sense to anybody ? " " I would recommend to not waste your time , but then again if I were you I 'd probably want to experience it myself . If that 's the case , bring a crossword puzzle or something so you don 't get bored . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" No one goes to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and expects the second coming of Citizen Kane . The same is true for the majority of low-rent horror flicks , especially those Roger Ebert has dubbed " " Dead Teenager Movies . " " The Hills Have Eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a Dead Teenager Movie , only here , the teenagers have been given the superficial appearance of military trainees.Some will argue the line " " it 's only a movie " " when questionable facts are raised in a movie review , but I 've always been a firm believer that all good fantasy must be rooted in reality in order to be effective . In the Hills Have Eyes 2 , we 're to believe the main characters are military people on a training exercise , but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert . The dialog is awful and frequently vulgar to excess . Though the films aren 't nearly comparable , I kept imagining these " " soldiers " " being in Platoon , and shuddering with dread.Very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and fatigues : radio transmissions are carried out like teenage phone conversations ; a Colonel is addresses as " " hey , asshole " " by a Private . And nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do , or any sense of command structure , when things begin to go wrong . I think of the soldiers in James Cameron 's Aliens , a film of pure fantasy , and how even those futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations . Fantasy rooted in reality.I try to begin watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10 , and judge it 's strengths and weaknesses from there . You have to allow concessions for the material ; there 's no way Star Wars is as good of a movie as The Godfather , on equal terms . But both are excellent examples of their type.In that respect , while the Hills Have Eyes 2 is a pretty dreadful exercise in amateur and immature writing , it 's only modestly worse in that regard than the typical Dead Teenager Movie . On a technical side , the movie appears to have decent production values and is pretty well made from that perspective . Scenes that are intended to shock , or which are intended to evoke urgency or suspense generally work . So , while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 may indeed be a fate worse than death , there are certainly far worse horror flicks in circulation.It 's worth a watch for those who enjoy this type of stuff without the usual fanboy baggage , or those who don 't tend towards thinking every movie they see is either the Best Ever or the Worst Ever of all time . If you don 't " " get " " horror , especially the Dead Teenager variety , you 're not likely to have a good time with this one.4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" What Fox 's fascination with dysfunctional families , made up of mean , obnoxious , spoiled kids , and parents who are determined to be cool , as opposed to being a parent ? ? I 'm sorry , I don 't get it . The one episode that I was barely able to stomach watching involved one of the kids demanding a Bar Mitzvah , with the intention of getting thousands of dollars in gift money . Of course , the idiot mother decides that her precious little junior has to have the biggest and bes-test party of all , and has no problem dropping 20 grand on the big event . The ditzy , brain dead , boy crazy teenage daughter bounces back and forth between wanting to be Jewish and then Catholic , when she see 's the " " cute " " religious tutors.The one borderline " " heartwarming " " moment in the entire episode , was when the putz of a father , who has been convinced the entire time that the Bar Mitzvah is solely a money making scheme , see 's the son studying his Hebrew lessons , and is momentarily duped into thinking that perhaps , his conniving offspring is being sincere about the right of passage into manhood . This warm , fuzzy feeling is immediately ripped out of his chest when he informs junior that since he has not yet had a bris , a certain " " procedure " " needs to be performed . The Bar Mitzvah is called off , and the mother is out several thousands of dollars when the kid refuses to comply.This show is garbage , and I am saddened that I shall never get back the 23 minutes of my life I wasted watching this piece of crap , because nothing else was on TV ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie isn 't worth the film it was photographed on . The dialog is flat , filled with clich챕 overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time . The choppy , shaky , film style is a cheap imitation of the " " The Ring " " style visual effects . The characters do not even act like a normal person would . For example , the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door , creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn 't even once call out her sister 's name to see if she is home . What ? You would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her . Way too many flashbacks to her childhood . Too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director . It is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street , up the driveway , around this corner , over here , over there , oh a side view , now a front view .

" Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since , in fact , most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events . Unfortunately , what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom . One cares not who wins , loses , dies or lives--just end it as soon as possible . This is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology . Scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality about them . They might better be done on a bare stage and left that way . One cannot expect the amazing effects of " " The House of the Flying Daggers " " or " " The Golden Compass , " " but , after all , this is a 2002 digitally mastered production . Characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene , so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms . In my view , this film turns the French Revolution of the 1790s into the " " papier-mache " " revolution of a " " papier colle " " world . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The " " math " " aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this TV show apart from the millions of other cop shows . The only redeeming aspect to this show is Rob Morrow , although his career must have been ( undeservedly ) waning after Northern Exposure if he signed up for this schlock.The lame-ness of the " " math " " aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co-starring Lou Diamond Phillips ( which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned . ) In order to catch a fugitive , the " " mathematician " " uses some theory about " " bubbles " . " So , he gives this long explanation that , if we have seen the suspect in places A , B and C , then we can use " " bubble theory " " to calculate where he might be . He does this all on a chalkboard , or maybe with a stick in the dirt ( I cant remember ) .Anyway , when you look at the finished product , he basically took three spots , and picked a point right in the middle and said " " Ok , mathematically , here 's where we are most likely to find the fugitive . " " At which point , one other character points out " " Oh , that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live . " " Is that math ? Its not even connect-the-f * * k * * g-dots ! ! !

" The best thing I can say about " " Quintet " " is that it 's not quite as bad as I remembered it being on my first viewing.But that doesn 't mean it 's good.This weird , sci-fi thriller is not quite like any other movie I 've ever seen , which I guess at least gives it the stamp of novelty . But it 's a borderline disaster of a movie , and one of the worst Robert Altman ever made . On the DVD special feature about the making of " " Quintet , " " it 's clear that even Altman didn 't know what the hell the movie was supposed to be.It 's set in some distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age . The film was shot at the abandoned site of the Montreal Expo ' 67 , and I do have to admit that this gives the movie some interesting production design elements , even if much of it looks like it 's being filmed in an iced-over shopping mall . Paul Newman , looking zonked out and absolutely disinterested in anything going on around him , and Brigitte Fossey , play drifters who wander into this futuristic city looking for Newman 's brother . Soon Newman is caught up in a deadly game of " " Quintet , " " which all of the bored inhabitants play for lack of anything better to do , and the rules of which are never made clear to the audience . All we know is that the object of the game it to kill everyone else you 're playing with and remain the only person alive . This gives these nihilistic inhabitants their only thrill , because as one of them says at one point in a psychobabblish soliloquy , only by being near to death can one appreciate being alive.The movie is slow , ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch due to its unrelenting gloominess . It 's almost as if Altman was purposely setting out to make a movie no one would want to sit through . There aren 't characters -- oh sure , actors walk around speaking lines , but none of the lines really means much and the impressive list of international actors Altman assembled for this register not a whit . Only Bibi Andersson gives the closest thing to a memorable performance as could possibly be found in a movie like this . But nevertheless , it does succeed in establishing an atmosphere , even if that atmosphere is one of pure awfulness , and it is oddly fascinating in the way that watching a man slowly starve himself to death would be fascinating.Altman really hit a dry spell after nearly a decade of superb films . " " Quintet " " followed close on the heels of the atrocious " " A Wedding " " and was followed in short order by the not bad but mostly forgettable " " A Perfect Couple , " " the by-all-accounts terrible " " Health " " ( which I 've never seen because it 's not available anywhere TO see ) and the disastrous " " Popeye .

" Okay , let me coin a new word here : polyphobia : The fear of polyamorous relationships . This is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by titillating audiences about some kind of threesome , only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamistic solution . Only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person , and this director is not one of them . Bleh.Mark my words : a few decades from now , polyphobia is going to be just as big a faux-pas as homophobia , but guess who was too close-minded to realize this ? Right the first time : the producers of this movie . And so many like it . Why even make a ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned type of movie like this ? Priding itself on being limitlessly open-minded about gayness , it completely overlooks the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy , which in turn in turning into swinging and polyamory .

" This movie has no respect for the viewer 's time . It takes a 15 minute story and stretches it into 95 minutes . In order to achieve this , they have to use a very slow narration and have everyone run around with some implausible frantic angst . By the time this movie showed anything interesting in the plot , I just didn 't care . The problem is not in the acting , but instead the pacing . The story is just weak . Jim Carrey is a capable actor , but his attempts to inject light humor into a serious role is just out of place . His style of humor is not generic , so he comes across as a watered down version of himself . The number 23 causes great grief and frustration to the people in the story , but the justification for this is never logical . At most it 's just mildly interesting . Jim Carrey has far more ability in a serious role than this movie reveals . Don 't waste your money seeing this in the theater . Rent this movie if you 've had problems sleeping . If you are still wide awake after 10 minutes , then you liked it more than I did . I was not fond of the lighting and artistic aspects of the film making either . A lot of passive visual eye candy was thrown at the viewer with lighting or effects and it did little to enhance the already weak story . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Since I 'd bought the DVD , I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet.The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary , falls in love , and marries her . Complications ensue.Douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor , given to heavily dramatic roles , sometimes hero , sometimes rat . He 's not bad in this thoroughly comic part . The problem is that the part isn 't particularly comic and neither is anything else.The plot rambles on . A dozen " " quirky " " characters come and go -- most prominently Keenan Wynn as Douglas 's friend who does nothing but make wry comments . Thelma Ritter was better at this sort of thing.Well , if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of . Some gags are silly . Others don 't clear that bar . Here 's what I thought of as an amusing line . Douglas has just hired Day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her . Day is disturbed and remarks that she 's never heard of a writer working in a beach house . Wynn asks if she liked Douglas 's previous book , " " Last Year 's Love . " " Yes , of course she did .

" What the hell was all that about ? I saw The Matrix and was amazed . It was the most spectacular movie ever made . What ever possesed the Wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond me.There is no plot , you can 't argue with that . Basically all this film was was a load of talking , and don 't get me wrong , I have no problem with talky films , but all the talking in The Matrix Reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle . Then there would be a fight sequence which lasted WAY too long , then more pointless drivvle , then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anti-climax ever . A little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes.Also , Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance yet . I knew he wasn 't a good actor but this was beyond a joke .

" Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has . The movie is pretentious garbage . It does not achieve anything at an artistic level . The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India . If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy , the ban would have been more justifiable.Now that I 've got my distress out of my system , I am more able to analyse the movie : * From the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in English . The director , of course , did not make the movie for an Indian audience ; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it . Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true . * Next we get regular glimpses into Radha 's dreams . These scenes are not very effective . They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie . I 'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story . I felt that the surrealism was lost . * The love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement . In any case , they do not achieve either of the two . * The names chosen for the women , Radha and Sita , are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences . However , since the film wasn 't meant for Indian audiences in the first place , the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal , which is absurd . * The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled . A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject . * The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some life into the role , the others were wasted . I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film . The male leads were outright rubbish.In case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director , stay away from this one . Please . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday evening , thinking that it might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis . On this promise , at least , the movie delivers : her character is ineffectual , adhering to nearly every slasher-type horror movie cliche . As does the movie . A cataloguing of its studied adherence to them would be an exercise in recall of something I hope to quickly forget , so I won 't make one . Basically , this is a whodunnit , heavy on the red herrings : everybody appears guilty , rather than just the two one suspects from the beginning . The " " rule out the logical and obvious , and what 's left is it " " rule of bad horror movies works well on this one . The only surprise to have any impact on me was its final snagging of the indeterminate ending cliche : will Jane keep her appointment with her attempted rescuer , who will tell her the ( obvious to the audience ) identity of the 2nd conspirator , propelling her into another round of hysterical victim-play .

" There are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that : 1 ) The people who made this documentary ( including the director and the producer ) are Serbs or of Serbian origin , therefore the criteria of neutrality fails . For instance , they mentioned that the diaspora Croats ( the so called " " Ustase " " ) played a huge part in the fall of Yugoslavia , but they didn 't mention that there were equal Serbian organizations as well ( Cetniks ) ! For you who aren 't that familiar with Balkan WW2 history : The Serbian so called " " Cetniks " " that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped British paratroops during the war . Well , that 's only half the truth . They were also a fascist ( Monarch ) group who collaborated with the Germans , but then switched side when Hitler started losing the war . It 's also ironic that they don 't mention the Cetnik leader Mihajlovic in the documentary , a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over Bosnia and Croatia . But they mentioned a certain Ante Pavelic ... Hm ... Allow me to be just a little suspicious.2 ) Most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown .

Who knows.3 ) In The documentary they talk about Kosovo and how the Serbs have lived there for ages , and therefore it should belong to Serbia ( even though they are a minority ) . Well , when they mention the Serbian dominated part of Croatia ( Krajina ) suddenly the Serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long . Fine , but what people don 't know is that the largest city in Krajina ( Knin ) has great historical importance for the Croatian people . It was there where one of the most celebrated Kings of Croatian history ( Zvonimir ) was crowned , and therefore the city has a historical value for Croatia . The Serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later ! But no , the Serbs should have Krajina and Kosovo according to the documentary . Is that fair ? To me it looks like double standards of morality from the director . Plus , it is said in the documentary that the Croatian constitution didn 't have any laws about minority rights , this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented BECAUSE of the fact that Croatia had a huge Serbian minority.4 ) The film mentions a radical Croatian Paramilitarian leader called Glavas . Or the Muslim radical Oric . They accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war . Yes , they were radicals , but if you want to talk about radicals , why not also mention the Serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as Seselj and Arkan ? The flaws are so many that I just presented a few of them , just so that people get an overview of the documentary . It looks like the people who made this documentary weren 't well prepared and didn 't have the guts to criticize the Serbs because they were afraid that their Serbian relatives would slap them or something . There aren 't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality , but the best so far is " " The death of Yugoslavia " " where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed ( e.g. Milosevic , Jovic , Bulatovic , Tudman , Izetbegovic , Karadzic etc . ) and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of Yugoslavia and the war.One other thing . I saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the US gave support to a country ( Bosnia ) that had connections with Bin Laden during the war . Well , first of all , all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the Bosnian Muslims didn 't have an old ethnic identity ( previosly they were called " " Muslim Croats " " ) they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people , and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common : Their religion . And they took help from the Mujahedin because no one else would support them . They had to fight the 4 : th largest army in Europe ! They needed all the help they could get . Nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war . History has shown us that . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Foreigner is a straight-to-video Steven Seagal film that was originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in March , 2003 , an intention which was reportedly reversed when Seagal 's prior film ( Half Past Dead ) tanked at the box office . According to some reports , the film had a lavish $ 20 million budget , including location shoots in Warsaw and Paris , and was completed as part of the studio 's obligation to a two-picture deal which was negotiated after the relative success of Exit Wounds seemed to indicate that Seagal still had a solid following.Despite the size of their investment , Sony Screen Gems probably made the right move in shelving this movie . It is nearly incomprehensible . What am I saying ? It IS incomprehensible . I don 't think I understood what was going on at all , except in the very broadest terms.Seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy . Other mysterious guys try to stop him . Other highly mysterious guys try to kill the moderately mysterious guys who try to stop him . Other really , really mysterious guys do especially mysterious stuff , all of which which was in fact too mysterious for me to figure out . The intended recipient 's mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband . Because he is a self-proclaimed " " consummate professional " " who has been hired to deliver the package only into the hands of the husband , Seagal at first defies the wife , then later gets involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with unexplained agendas , as well as from her husband.Many people have mysterious , cryptic conversations . Many people blow each other 's brains out . Some guys seem to die more than once , while in other scenes gunfights end without a clear view of the result , so the audience sees somebody die , but is not sure which one of the gunslingers is headed to boot hill . Allegiances shift often , adding further mystery . Or should I say confusion ? I don 't know who was on whose side , or what anybody really wanted , and the resolution was as unsatisfying as the exposition . At the end of the movie , I just sat there thinking , " " That 's the end ? What the ... ? " " I couldn 't even figure out the credits . IMDb says that Aussie actress Kate Fischer ( from " " Sirens " " ) was in this film , but I 'll be damned if I know where . Either she was left on the cutting room floor or she wisely opted out of the project . She could have found some activities more beneficial to her career , like having unnecessary surgery , ripping those pesky insert cards out of magazines , or taking some community college courses in animal husbandry.Seagal used to be a pretty fair hand-to-hand combatant , but the action scenes didn 't manage to redeem this film at all . Seagal is in his 50 's now and is a very large man , so he is reduced to a mimimal level of physical exertion and even during that he is contained in a knee-length coat to hide his inchoate Brandoesque girth . He might even get a little winded removing the wrappers from candy bars , although that 's understandable if you estimate just how many of those he must have to eat to maintain his present girth.Steven Seagal seemed to be making a comeback with Exit Wounds , but if his last film was half past dead , this one must be pretty close to filling out the other half . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
The Greek locale for parts of the movie were very beautiful and the photography get all my votes and that 's about the extent of my raves for this movie . I found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes found so often in the American culture and were shallow and uninteresting . Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to look at but I found their characters very narcissistic and unlikeable for many other reasons . When Gena Rowlands sings at a party it made me wonder how this woman could think of herself as a competent star of the stage . I was tempted to hit the MUTE button until she finished singing . Molly Ringwald was herself and Raul Julia 's character was so lecherous he was downright creepy . The movie was much too long for my liking and I could not sit through it again even at the point of a gun . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's funny how instinct warns you of something . For example as soon as the company credits read Nu Image I knew instinctively I 'd seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn 't remember where . Nevertheless I just knew JUDGE AND JURY was going to be crap and it was . Maybe I 'm psychic ? ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! The opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time . I don 't know about you but I 'm geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language , especially if it 's spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie . Anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife . Oh did I mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night ? Yeah he 's a serious badass mofo . In fact he 's so bad ( And I don 't mean the acting - I 'll get to that in a moment ) that he 's impossible to take seriously and this is before he 's executed only to return as Elton John , Elvis , a French chef etc . I wonder if Keith David got paid for this ? because he looks lke he 's having so much fun on screen that 's the only reason he 's playing the role . What a pity this reviewer didn 't have any fun whatsoever watching JUDGE AND JURY . Hey maybe the producers could send me Keith 's fee ? Gawd only knows I deserve it.I disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn 't guessed and my main beef isn 't with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence . If like me you 've had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you 'll know violence is an obscene painful thing , but JUDGE AND JURY will have you believe that if you 're thrown through a window , crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you 'll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs . It could of course be argued that any film starring Sly , Arnie or Bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with JUDGE AND JURY it yanked my chain , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * * * May contain spoilers * * * I had very high expectations for this film , based on the trailer . I knew a bit about the real Ed Gein , so I figured this was a medium-budget Hollywood version of the real events . Man was I wrong.First , the writing apparently came from an eight-grader who barely knew anything about Ed 's history and cranked out the script in about 20 minutes . The movie completely passes over the most interesting facets of Ed and his relationship with his mother ( not to mention what the real police found in his house ) and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy who looks like he just wandered onto the set . Likewise , all of the male characters seem to be ad-libbing their dialog throughout the entire movie . I 'm not exaggerating.Don 't even get me started with the historical goofs in this movie . Seriously , who the hell directed this ? This movie is supposed to take place around 1957 , but the cops are carrying modern side-handled batons , some of the stuff in the hardware store look like they came from Lowes , and when the cop gets to a payphone he dials 9-1-1 ( didn 't exist back then ) . Also , Ed was a small guy , scary like Anthony Perkins ' character in Psycho ( who was supposedly based on real-life Ed ) , not this burly dude who ended up looking way too much like the bad guy in Men In Black.Another thing that really bugged me was the appearance that the makers of this film shot the whole thing in an abandoned , 3 building set . Because of the " " clever " " camera angles , you never see any actual town , and the interior of the sets looked like old , long-abandoned shacks . Pop a cash register on a saw-horse and bam ! --instant hardware store.I 'm usually pretty forgiving of low-budget horror films , but this one just begs for it . All you had to do was include most of the real events ( even embellish them ! ) , pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones , and for Pete 's sake take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while . My advice : Google Ed Gein , you 'll be far more entertained . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film is so awful it is funny , not quite to Troll 2 levels of hilarity , but funny nonetheless . The acting is awful , the music is atrocious and the story does not make a blind bit of sense . The story revolves around a man dressed in an awful granny costume killing a bunch of people at a party . The death scenes are so badly done they are hilarious . One girl is stabbed repeatedly in the chest , but does not scream , try or defend or self or run away . She also manages to remain standing despite being stabbed repeatedly . Another death scene involving a rope is also extremely hilarious . No thought seems to have been put into the plot . The Granny seems to magically move from one area to another ( e.g. be hiding under leaves in a woodland just where the victim just happens to stand , appears in front of someone even though it had been behind them ten seconds earlier ) , people kiss at extremely inappropriate moments ( would you stop and kiss someone if you were being chased by a homicidal maniac ) and the double twist at the end is utterly ridiculous , it seems they just threw it on just to confuse people . I would advise people to watch this film if they love awful horror movies like Troll 2 , The Dreaded or Blood Gnome , but do not watch it if you are expecting a scary horror movie , you will be disappointed , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Although a well produced made for television movie , Dying to Love You reeks with low grade melodramatic splendor.The film opens up to Roger Paulson ( Tim Matheson , looking much older than I remember him to be ) , who is a struggling businessman that leads an empty , lonely life after his wife Ruthie ( who looks suspiciously like Roseanne Arnold ) leaves him with the quickness . Now all Roger has is his cats .... and his ad in the newspaper . Once his ad is answered , he calls Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa-oh it doesn 't matter I 'm whoever you want me to be-Lawrence . Then ... they have phone sex.I 'm not sure where you 're from or when you were born , but I remember that phone-sex bit was played out by the late ' 80 's . I 'm sorry but that was trashy.Soon Roger and the broad hook up and have a whirlwind romance . They fall in love , visit the zoo to see gorillas , and then have some kinky sex with Roger 's son in the other room . She ties him to the bed and seduces him.Roger is just so stupid that he does not realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a bimbo that loves to sleep around . God forbid women only sleep with one man . Soon enough , strange phone calls begin to occur , Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute quickness , and she keeps ranting and raving about her ex-husband who used to beat her . It 's funny to see Roger believe her through all this stuff . That 's until a frumpy co-worker tells him to go snooping through her belongings like a nosy housewife . He takes her crappy advice and lo and behold , he finds a suitcase crawling with fake ID cards and wigs and guns and a crossbow . He immediately takes the suitcase to the police and has her arrested . Even though all this jazz , he still loves the dumb broad . She tells so much lies , it seems her tongue will catch fire if she tells the truth once.Roger goes on with his life and meets an ugly woman named Angela who looks like something off of Gremlins 2 . She has a child as well and Roger takes quite a liking to her . But something inside Roger 's subconscious keeps him connected to Lisa Rohn ( if that 's even her real name ) and he keeps going back to see her.Now Lisa is the " " ex that won 't go away " " as she " " earns " " herself a get out of jail free card and shows up at Roger 's doorstep and his son Matt is so busy trying to check her out , he pours juice all over the floor . IL ' Rog is so stupid , he throws Lisa out and doesn 't even change the locks . Boy , if all people were that stupid , I wouldn 't even be writing this review . The ending of this movie is so corny , you won 't believe.Tim Matheson is a Made-for-TV-Movie king. he just looks like such a dawm mummy in this movie . He 's a little wooden and stiff . The dazzling Tracy Pollan works well with her role and her trampiness rings true . She is extremely beautiful and I do see what Michael J. Fox sees in her .

" I really wanted to like this movie . The previews looked marginally funny but I figured they put most of the funny stuff in the previews . In this case , they not only did that but they twisted the clips so that they appeared much funnier than they were in the real film . I like John Travolta , Uma Thurman , Vince Vaughn , The Rock , Cedric the Entertainer , etc. so I wanted to like this movie but it just never seemed to do anything.I saw Get Shorty and did not particularly care for it . Too slow and unfunny for me . This movie is certainly no better and , if anything , is worse . There were a lot of opportunities for some good comedic moments but it took none of them.The acting was okay but even John Travolta seemed toned down . Cedric was okay but he was too reigned in to be really funny . Vince Vaughn and the Rock were pretty good and ready to be funny but they just let it all pass them by . I wish they had been given a chance to follow through with the funny things they set up but instead it just kept going back to the same old thing and back to just setting Vaughn and Rock up to be funny ( though never allowed to really deliver that punchline or comedy ) .Overall , this was a very disappointing movie and I am glad I only saw it on video .

" " " Go Fish " " garnered Rose Troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.Its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms .

" By now most of us actually do know , that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes .

I would have thought that the story of the creation of Las Vegas would prove interesting but it fails at almost every turn .

Once or twice he flashes through the fog of his performance to deliver an interesting scene but most of the time you just can 't care about him .

" * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * Disjointed and confusing arson drama that has to do with a sinister plan to burn down a major vacation resort before New Years Day . Being insured for ten million dollars the man behind Valley View Estates in the Blue Mountains in Australia Julian Fane , Guy Doleman , is determined to bring his own project down in flames in order to collect . This has to happen by January 1 , two weeks hence , before the insurance policy on the project runs out.With his mind totally on his work builder and architect Howard Anderson , Tom Skerritt , has no idea that his boss , Julian Fane , is planning to burn down the resort he 's building and possibly set him up as the fall guy . Anderson gets a bit suspicious when insurance investigator Sophie McCann , Wendy Hughes , informs him on some very fishy goings on between Fane and the insurance company Proud Alliance . It turns out that Proud Allience is actually owned , or 60 % of it , by Fane himself ! This explains whey Fane is having all these arson fires happen in order to collect the ten million dollars of insurance which is at least twice as much as the entire Valley View Estates is worth ! We later have Sophie McCann murdered , in a faked swimming accident , to keep her from finding out whats happening with the suspicious fries around and in Valley View Estates . It 's when Lloyd 's of London , who 's underwriting Proud Alliance , insurance investigator George Engles , James Mason , shows up that Fane takes a powder leaving his ace arsonist on his own and out of control to blow Fane 's entire plan.Meanwhile Anderson has gotten wise to both Fane and Engles who unlike Fane wants the Valley View Estates to go under for reasons which are never made quite clear , just watch the last few seconds of the film to realize that , by it 's writer and director . The arsonist is exposed as he 's about to do in his girlfriend with Anderson coming to her rescue . We then have this wild chase scene with the arsonist getting lost in the Valley View construction site only to have it set on fire , with the help of Howard Anderson , where he ends up burning to a crisps by the time the fire department came to hose him down.The sudden and unexplained ending never made clear to just what happened to the Big Cheese in this whole scheme of things the sinister and evil minded Julian Fane . It 's as if Fane got away Scot-free and only his unstable and deranged henchman , the arsonist , who was only the instrument of Fane 's crimes ended up as the only person who payed from them . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was a flick doomed from its conception . The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film , and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie . I wasn 't the least bit interested . Then came the trailer . Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic , but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie ; and I 'm not exaggerating - every moment , every plot point , every joke is told in the trailer . It 's like a 3-minute Cliff 's Notes version of the flick . So obviously I wasn 't gonna pay to see it , but once it hit DVD , I thought sure , I 'll watch it for free . Maybe Steve Carell can save it.Nope.I 'm still baffled as to why he signed on for this . He must have owed someone a favor . The jokes were all so flat and obvious , and the director obviously asked him to go for very broad comedy style like the original Bruce Almighty 's Jim Carrey . But it 's just not funny . The studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40-Year-Old Virgin , complete with several of Carell 's past co-stars , a reference to the flick on a theater marquee , and another musical closing credits sequence . But even the talented Carrell can 't save this . His co-stars don 't fare much better , with people like Morgan Freeman , Jonah Hill , and Ed Helms just wasted . Wanda Sykes isn 't wasted , she 's just a waste in anything she does , and her horrible one-liners and reactions just make you wish people would stop giving her work.The story itself is just predictable and lazy . It pounds you over the head with obvious foreshadowing , like Evan 's disregard for the environment ( drives a gas-guzzling Humvee , opts to use wood from endangered trees for his house , hates animals , ... ) , and by the end it 's just over-the-top preachy on both faith and the environment.Why the movie was made at all is puzzling enough , but I really don 't understand how it reportedly became the most expensive comedy ever . The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals , and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue / green-screen work I 've ever seen . Maybe the rental of the live animals on set cost a fortune . Who knows . But whatever it was that cost them so much , it didn 't translate to quality , that 's for sure .

This statement defines his cinema perfectly , a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations , adventure and war films , westerns and of course , his famous melodramas.Sirk 's melodramas were , as the very word signifies , dramas with music . The music sets the tone for his masterful style , and every stroke of his brush ( Sirk was also a painter ) leaves a powerful image on the screen-turned-canvas . But this ain 't life but its representation , an imitation of life . Sirk never tried to show reality , on the contrary . None of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by Hollywood ( most notably Technicolor ) to distinguish the artificial from the real thing . Let 's remember that his golden period coincides with the time when Hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama ( Blackboard jungle , Rebel without a cause ) . Sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else.Another of Sirk 's statements summarizes this : ' You can 't reach , or touch , the real . You just see reflections . If you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass ' . I defy anybody that has seen Written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen . One ends up giving up.Therefore , we are in a hall full of mirrors where there 's no difference between real and its false copy . Nobody can say that the Hadley are real people . That town ain 't real either , with those hideous oil pumps all over the place . So in this realm the acting is affected , the decore is fake , the trick is visible . Everything is pushed a little bit off the limit ( the sexual connotations of Dorothy Malone with the oil tower , for example ) . Sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time . ' The angles are the director 's thoughts ; the lighting is his philosophy ' . In Written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows . The Hadleys house , with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way . A house that resembles a mausoleum , that no party can cheer up . As tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night , Sirk 's photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters , and so are the colours of the clothes they wear . Drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director 's craft.Sirk considered himself a ' story bender ' , because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose . Written on the wind is a good example . It wouldn 't work in any other hands.The other director that was using similar strategies was Frank Tashlin , who was for 50 's comedy the same that Sirk was for melodrama . Their films are full of the machinery of american life -advertising , TV sets , jukeboxes , washing machines , sport cars , vacuum cleaners- to depict its emptiness and decay . I 'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences . The game was played by both sides , so it was camp . Now we regard them as ' cult ' or ' bizarre ' , because we are not those spectators anymore . That is why Todd Haynes 's homage ' Far from heaven ' turns into a pastiche , because it reproduces Sirk 's work nowadays as if nothing happened in between . Then Sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that Julianne Moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film.Sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly . There were always immovable characters ( Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall here ) against which he could assemble a series of split ones . His balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters , because these are the ones Sirk is interested in too . When Robert Stack flies the plane and ' tempts ' Lauren Bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them ( obvious Faustian echoes ) we are strangely fascinated with him too , as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with Mitch alone by the river.In the Sirk 's universe the studio often-imposed ' happy ends ' have no negative impact . In fact they worked just great . Sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the Deux ex machinea of his day . Thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback , so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the Hadley feud.It was pointed out the many similarities between Written on the Wind with the Godfather saga . I absolutely agree and I 'm sure the parallel is not incidental . Both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family . The temperamental son portrayed by Robert Stack has an amazing physical resemblance with Jimmy Caan 's Sonny Corleone . The action of fighting her sister 's male friend is symmetrical . The non-son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films , as the fact that both families carry the names of their town . Even details as the gate that gives access to the property , and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves , suggest that Coppola had Written on the Wind in mind while setting his masterwork . Because both films deal with the subject of Power : the acquisition of power , its manipulation and legacy ( even Kyle Hadley 's sterility , the event that hastens the turmoil , is an issue easily tied to the central theme of Power , in this case , a weakness in sexual power ) . The other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is Citizen Kane . One wouldn 't think at first of similarities between Welles and Sirk 's films but there are a good many , starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family 's fortune and ending in the fact that Mitch Wayne ( Rock Hudson ) , as Charles Foster Kane , was adopted by a tutor , having his own father alive . Amazingly , the same actor ( Harry Shannon ) perform both Wayne and Kane 's fathers . This detail is cannot be a coincidence.Written on the Wind is a masterpiece in every aspect , in execution and vision , in style and technique , a highlight in the career of this wonderful director . Some say that this is his best film . In my opinion , ' Magnificent obsession ' , ' All that heaven allows ' , ' There 's always tomorrow ' and ' Imitation of life ' are just as good . And for those who put Sirk in the level of Dallas or Dinasty I wish them no happy end . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself : 1 . Plants eating people have been done HUNDREDS of times . It 's been used by Nintendo in everything from Mario to Zelda to Metroid Prime . It 's been used in plenty of low-budget 50 's movies , on par with the lowest of the Godzilla franchise . And this brings it to a whole another level of cheese with plants that TALK . I 've known no one who walked out , but I know a lot of people who absolutely broke out in hysteric laughing during parts of this movie . I was one of them . Doesn 't the horror genre deserve something a little better than this pile of laughable crap ? 2 . The characters easily could have been copy / pasted from Hostel or Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek or any other movie with collage kids with bad luck . Yet it 's called " " characterizing " " when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clich챕s that hundreds of characters before have had ? Don 't you ever wish a movie had characters that weren 't just forgettable pieces of meat with legs ? 3 . This was not gory . A guy cuts his skin off . Oh , my ! ( Not . ) A guy gets his legs broken . Oh my ! Gasp ! ( Not . ) I have shown movies like this to my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick , and she said : " " I 've seen PG movies worse than that ! Why was it rated R ? " " So , why was it rated R ? 4 . Here 's the only plot the movie / book has : collage kids drink , have sex , get naked , cruse , bleed , and eventually die . This is possibly the most typical example of a cheap , thoughtless horror movie , yet people call this " " mature " " ? What the . . . ? 5 . I do not think I have ever seen something less original sense I watched A Beautiful Mind . Haven 't you ever sat there and wished the horror genre , easily the most diverse genre out there , would do something . . . well , diverse ? Something truly original ? I just wish more horror movies would have actual horror , not just cheap collage parties put on film with a few splatters of fake blood tossed around.1 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was such a waste of time . Danger : If you watch it you will be tempted to tear your DVD out of the wall and heave it thru the window.An amateur production : terrible , repetitive , vacuous dialog ; paper-thin plot line ; wooden performances ; Lucy Lawless was pathetically hackneyed.Seriously flawed story , completely unbelievable characters . The two worst concepts in film and t.v. are : ( 1 ) the evil twin , ( 2 ) amnesia . There are no twins.The plot " " twist " " ? Outrageously simplistic and obvious - like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies . It doesn 't even resolve properly .

" I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script : 1.Let 's make a serial killer movie like Se7en , Knight Moves , Copycat , and Silence of the Lambs . People like serial killer stuff . It 'll sell ... 2.The killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern . I know ; he 'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel . That hasn 't been done yet , at least not exactly like that . 3.Now , we need some kind of way to make this movie unique ; of course , the good guy can be bedridden like in Rear Window . 4.Lastly , we need a twist ending that will give this movie the success of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.Okay , now that you know these things , you know the whole movie , so don 't waste your money . One thing I really hate about moviemakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and completely run them into the ground . I wrote better stories than this when I was in Junior High . I just kept checking my watch every five minutes . When the twist ending finally came , I wasn 't shocked , I just said , " " Oh . Who cares ? ! " " The characters are two-dimensional . They have your typical movie personalities . This movie is just proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script . I give this movie 1 out of 10 . Normally , it would earn at least 2 or 3 , but I 'm so sick of the unoriginality . When will they learn ? 1 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Lame movie . Completely uninteresting . No chemistry at all between Indiana Jones and the guy from Black Hawk Down . The car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum . They manage to switch vehicles a few times , but always end up right on the tail of the baddies . The scene where Hartnett grabs the family 's car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be . He is telling them about Eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die , which I imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty . It just came off as moronic , totally unbelievable and even cruel.Some subplots weren 't even explored , they were just used as filler . Why does Hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes ? Why , and on what grounds , is the bad IA guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief ? Why can IA pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be Indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist ? For some reason , even though Ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor , ( he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer 's house to jack up his own commission ) , they keep coming back to him anyway ! They knew he lied to both of them ! Yet there they were , coming to terms that both said they would never go for . Stupid , just stupid . This is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders . There they were , just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover . Amazing that they didn 't hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds each .... The scriptwriting was terrible , the action sequences were boring , the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for Ford and Hartnett . It fails miserably . And Ford 's phone ! Turn the damn thing off ! How many times could it ring in a 2-hour movie ? 50 ? 60 ? It was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie ! Every 30 seconds , that stupid tune would play ! And if it wasn 't Ford 's , then Hartnett 's was ringing ! It was incredibly annoying !

" This series takes a classic story and makes rubbish of it . Robin is somehow mystified by an elk-man in the forest and is embroiled in all sorts of druidism and outright satanic episodes . The story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor . This is barely watchable . And to top all the ridiculousness they kill Robin at the end of series 2 and replace him with another actor . Some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is NOT a Robin Hood show .

" * * Possible Spoilers Ahead * * Whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes , a name that invariably comes up is that of Larry Buchanan . This amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys ( ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS ) , cheap-jack crime dramas like A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY , and tawdry conspiracy flicks like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN . THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a humdinger to say the least . Overlooking the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow , Larry filmed this howler on a wide and round California lake . Early on , the film boasts some dazzling ( for the budget ) underwater photography and creates some atmosphere in spite of itself . Then it degenerates into windy dialogue uttered by no-name actors with lapsing Scottish accents , not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the much-maligned bagpipe . At one point , campers sing " " You Take The High Road , I 'll Take The Low Road , " " just to throw in one more Scottish cliche . If Scottish people ever decide to jump on the Political Correctness bandwagon they 'll sue Larry Buchanan over this film , his surname notwithstanding . The monster looks like a giant papier-mache puppet and it makes the dragon in Beanie & Cecil look terrifying by comparison . In one unforgettable scene Nessie takes to land and , to evade some patrolling soldiers , the fifty-foot long critter tries to hide behind a tree-and the soldiers don 't see it ! THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a true mind-boggler that must be seen-several times--to be believed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A young woman nicknamed " " T.N.T. " " for being virtual dynamite in a fight and a knockout in terms of looks to boot , goes to the most lawless part of Hong Kong in search of her missing brother Stag Jackson . When she learns he has been murdered , she decides she will bring the killer to justice in a fashion only she can.Sounds good , doesn 't it . Well , there 's really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting base for a martial arts / blaxploitation action thriller , which is what this aims to be . The leads actually prove pretty good too with Jeanne Bell fitting nicely into the role of " " T.N.T. " " and Stan Shaw doing well as the ambitious , power-hungry Charlie . Where this fails miserably is in terms of the fighting action it offers up . The fight scenes are totally and completely unconvincing and / or sometimes so completely over the top it reaches the point of ridiculousness which doesn 't at all help when the basic focus of your movie is a Kung Fu action heroine . Also the poor lighting , actors sporting accents making them hard to understand , the confusing camera-work and the sometimes poor sound doesn 't help this obvious low budget effort out either any . This does deliver in one area which may delight some fans , it does offer up plenty of the T in " " T & A " , " in fact practically every fight scene in the film is proceeded by some type of nude scene and Jeanne Bell actually does have one extended fight scene in which she is completely topless.In the end , this fails to be something you want to revisit because the fight scenes are so pathetically , laughingly bad . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue , the epitome of wooden acting , awful casting , all wrapped together without a plot.Tara Fitzgerald 's casting was bizarre , almost comic .

But a lot of it was clich챕s one after another . And did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like " " Lord of The Rings ?

It was one of the shortest movies I 've ever seen , and thank god ! How is robots turning against humans creative in any way ! It 's been done like a hundred times !

" The comment by " " eliz7212-1 " " hits the proverbial " " nail on the head " " for this turkey of a program . But it is a hoot to watch William Shatner " " cavort " " and " " dance " " ( yes , the " " " " marks on the word dance are necessary for what Bill does ) . This show would be a great skit on SNL or MAD TV - and it does rate a few stars for one viewing , or so , to see Shatner , who seems to have taken " " camp " " to new heights - whether in a role or as himself . But the guy is funny.The girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls , will be pretty much out-of-luck when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey-a-go-go genre , with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more.I watched the first contestant , who was annoying , and literally " " dumber than a : post , " " yet through sheer luck , walked away with a quarter mil or so . The second contestant , somewhat more intelligent , but who 'd be lucky to gain $ 1,000 on Jeopardy ! , got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question - which he didn 't know , and thereby left with zilch.This plethora of game shows , which dangle , and sometimes award , large sums to everyday individuals , are admittedly a cheap effort , overall , to attempt to woo viewers . Even if the host is well-compensated , and they give away six figures in an average episode , I suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable - since you don 't have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures , per episode , with some big residual deals as well.But I suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long . This one has already pretty much reached this point . I think his offerings , especially with James Spader , and the others on " " Boston Legal " " should give us a satisfying quantity of Bill Shatner 's offerings.Again , the above rating is simply appropriate to view Bill hoot and prance , perhaps one time ; that should be sufficient . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The Jeremiah Stone dude was hilarious . ( * SPOILER * ) I 'll never understand why he bit his finger off out of nowhere when he was holding that chick up hostage.The premise for the movie is just as atrocious as the other flaws . From what I could get from it , Jeremiah Stone was a gold digger during the Gold Rush , and a notorious outlaw . He had a crapload of gold , ( * SPOILER * ) and put a curse on anyone who went after his gold before he was gunned down by the locals after he killed some girl , but not only did he survive , he bit off his own finger and ran off . So , present day , a group of clueless morons find out about this gold mine , and of course , they are warned by locals about " " The Curse of the Forty-Niner " . " And what do they do ? As expected , ignored the warnings and greedily sought for the gold . They get the gold , and all sorts of s * * t goes on . Thankfully , ( * SPOILER * ) the bitch gets her head cut off.That 's about it . Looking at the cover of the film , you can tell what kind of movie it 's going to be .

I doubt they 'll be replacing this one , somehow.I couldn 't say that it 's one of the worst movies I 've ever seen , but it 's very dull . No real cannibal scenes . Me Me Lai is not naked enough of the time ( only about 4 or 5 times ) . And she 's not the Thai goddess that I expected , either . So two of my reasons for watching this movie were knocked out.There is some severe animal violence here for those that enjoy that sort of thing . A great fight between a mongoose and a large snake gets quite bloody . Animal torture , as well , some of which is real and some fake . Thankfully the fake is somewhat funny , but the real is just a little sickening.Generally speaking , it 's a 70s film - overly long , under-developed , not as deep as it would have liked to have been .

" " " Witchery " " might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80 's but , luckily enough , it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects , an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices . Honestly the screenplay doesn 't make one iota of sense , but who cares when Linda Blair ( with an exploded hairstyle ) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer ( who can 't seem to get laid ) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo , sewn-shut lips , upside down crucifixions , vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune . Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts . The young couple is there to investigate the place 's dark history ; the dysfunctional family ( with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are ) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex . They 're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady 혯 an aging actress or something who always dresses in black 혯 starts taking them out in various engrossing ways . Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window . Anyway , the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of " " The Evil Dead " . " The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film .

" I checked this out at the Vancouver International Film Festival and was not impressed.The only area of the film I enjoyed was the commentary on film-making . For the most part , this film seemed random and somewhat fantastical ( I don 't say that in a complimentary way , however ) and just silly . It was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life , which may sounds intriguing in some films , but the fantasy merely seemed needlessly perverse.My criticism of this film is not upon the actors , rather the story itself . I found it boring and narcissistic . I wanted my money back , but considering it was a Film Festival , that wasn 't about to happen . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy Charles Bronson vehicle . Bronson is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys . He was quietly moving in the TV movie " " Yes Virginia , There is a Santa Claus " " and showed a lot of class and style in the Sean Penn-directed " " The Indian Runner " . " In " " The Evil That Men Do " , " however , Bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists , knives and , of course , guns . There 's nothing here you haven 't seen in the last five " " Death Wish " " flicks . Wait , I take that back . This has to be the most sadistic and repellently violent film Bronson has ever had the dis-service of being in . Not just repellent in the scenes of torture or the descriptions of torture , but in the fact that these scenes were put in a film just to sell tickets . And Jose Ferrer ! What in blue blazes was he doing here ? ! ! I mean , he won an Oscar , for crying out loud ! ! ! Okay , sorry about that outburst . Let me just say that " " The Evil That Men Do " " has to be one of the worst movies I had ever seen that was based on a book . Yeah , that 's right . I wonder if it was written with Bronson in mind ? No stars . Watch " " Death Wish " " instead . At least IT was topical . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I passed this one on the shelf a few times , looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes ( with tiny names ) on the front and wondering if I was missing something . The other night it was on one of the movie channels , and I tuned in . I missed nothing.I must admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes . Perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that . Given the slow , plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 , I seriously doubt it.The lead character starts the movie in classic " " I don 't know how to start my movie " " style , with a long , tiresome monologue about how he doesn 't want to get sued . It 's not funny . It 's not even remotely funny . Others have commented on the " " San Franclisco " " bit ; ok , a small chuckle the first time he says it . Then he grinds it into the ground , smiling at the camera like it 's the funniest thing ever written . Get over yourself . In fact , I think the talking to the camera bit was the reason I instantly disliked the film . Don 't assume familiarity with your audience . Familiarity is _ earned _ , much like respect.From there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp . I didn 't realize he 's Jewish ; it 's a discredit to Jewish comedians to call this " " Jewish humor " . " It 's just unfunny humor . Just because you 're Jewish doesn 't mean you have a knack for the comedy . A WASP , Spalding Gray , does a better job of self-analytical humor than this guy , so obviously it 's not about ethnicity.If one of the bits I had seen had worked , I might have stuck around . But some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with , then listing them for five long minutes , doesn 't make a great movie.This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of " " Office Space " . " Don 't let yourself become a victim of target marketing . Just say no to " " Haiku Tunnel " . " , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Even by the standards of most B-movies , this movie is by far the worst I 've ever seen . The graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. the ocean water effects are especially laughable , including the one scene where they board the mini-sub , and the " " water " " looks like its frozen in place . The problems with this film are so numerous that I 'll just stop here with the details. needless to say , I kid you not when I say that even Uwe Toilet Boll himself could do a better job . Avoid this movie at all cost , there are other B grade movies out there that , despite being horrible , are at least a good way of passing the time by . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When ' My Deja Vu , My Deja Vu ' aired last season , I was pleased . Scrubs , I thought , is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clip-show concept . Instead of replaying footage , they 're replaying jokes in a self-aware manner , and I really enjoyed it.I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong . One season later , they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do , the clip show ... and it looked like it was put together by the work-experience kid . Dr Cox 's shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together , as it doesn 't appear again until ' My Long Goodbye ' some 4 episodes later . I can 't imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom . Who knows why it was slotted there , it just seemed lazy and out of place , reminding me ( largely ) of episodes that have aired within the past year.Three second clips jammed together with background music is a DVD extra for a ( very ) rainy day , not an episode of prime-time television . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The trouble is , there is too much gore for kiddies , so definitely don 't put this in your VCR for the toddlers . It starts off with a little bit of promise , giving you the impression that the box cover artist may have actually started watching this film before designing the cover , but then descends quickly into epic stupidity . The " " killer scarecrows " " are clumsy oafs that are about as scary as the one in the Wizard of Oz , but not quite as smart . If they 'd only had a brain ... ?

" It pains me to say this about an Australian film but Mr. Accident ranks with the worst of the worst films I have ever seen . What 's even more tragic is that it doesn 't fit into the ' it 's so bad it 's good ' category . What annoys me the most about this film is the fairly large amount of money that has been frittered away on a pointless , unfunny , underdeveloped , inept screenplay . Dumb performances ( What are Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore aka Elle McFeast doing in this trash ? ) , inadequate direction , no plot and a general sense of meanness totally take away from the interesting production design and leave you with a truly horrible taste in your mouth .

" " " Nat " " ( voiced by Trevor Gagnon ) , along with his brainiac friend " " IQ " " ( voiced by Philip Bolden ) and the always hungry " " Scooter " " ( David Gore ) are kids with big dreams . They want to be the first flies in space . And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon , the Apollo 11 , is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out.The first thing you notice is the animation of the film . I found it done very well done . The scenery had depth to it , as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes . I didn 't see the movie in 3-D , as it was broadcast on HBO . However , I could see that there really wasn 't any scenes which took advantage of the 3-D effects except a fight between characters near the end . I also wasn 't really impressed with the design of the characters . To me , they didn 't look like anything resembling a fly , especially in the coloring . The flies were an unusual blue-gray that was kind of distracting to me.The performances from the cast was not bad , but it wasn 't good either . There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story . The writing was certainly written for a younger audience , with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh . I saw nothing for adults , like jokes that they 'll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning.History was not followed in this film . In fact , I think it was completely ignored , as the main focus was the flies . I also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction , and no flies were on Apollo 11 . I did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though.If you are an adult , this is not for you . It was not made for the entire family . This is certainly just for kids . But , save this one for a rainy day . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Considering the original film version of ' The Haunting " " is in my top ten films of all time ' I approached this adaption with trepidation . I was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh , all those involved should be ashamed. the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason ! you see nothing . Robert Wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work 's . The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B , sadder still is that the ingredients were there ( actors such as Liam Neeson , Catherine Zeta Jones ) to do something different . This film should only watched as an example of studio butchery ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw ' Descent ' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was one huge disappointment . Disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful , the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and , being a fan ( sounds pervy , I 'm not ! ) of ' rape / revenge ' flicks of the 70 's , I was needless to say very curious to check this movie out . My conclusion : let 's stick to the classics ! Yes , the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat , the actors unconvincing . Even Dawson is empty . Some would say that it 's a right depiction of the college world in the US , that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial . Just like the scene where Dawson gets raped : it seriously lacks intensity ! I wasn 't expecting anything ' Irreversible ' -style but still , aren 't we suppose to feel compassion for her ? I didn 't . Not for a minute , she was so lame all the way ; - ) And I read that the photography was impressive . Well , it is good indeed but nothing ground-breaking either . I must admit that the screening at the festival wasn 't so good so maybe I missed out something here but at the end of the movie , I couldn 't help thinking ' I feel like watching Argento 's ' Inferno ' again. lol . More seriously , the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but I had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the American-Canadian border in Lynch 's ' Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me ' ... the crude red and blue lighting , the heavy bass music , the general lascivious / decadent atmosphere ... No , I just couldn 't get into this movie . Too bad . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge . I was suspicious seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I have never heard of , but it was a freebie , so why not check it out.Well my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget he 's ever taken part in such a shame of a film.Apparently , if your script and dialogs are terrible , even good actors cannot save the day . Not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film . Too many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers , reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie . It 's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound . The music is awful and totally out of place , and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play.I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other , better , movies .

" So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series , and had just watched parts 1-3 , which I thought were ALL excellent . They had a unique charm to them , and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated . About a year ago , I even saw Puppet Master Vs . Demonic Toys , which of course was bad , but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch.From the very beginning of this film , I knew it was in trouble . The cheesy Power Rangers-style Egyptian skull villain who watches the Puppets ' Rita Repulsa-style ' through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field ! All of the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd ! Suddenly we have a grand assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three films . I seriously doubt that when the first Puppet Master was being penned , the writers had visions of someday seeing an Egyptian Power Rangers villain , totem monsters , annoying twenty-somethings who seriously can 't act ( and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent ) , and a lame " " Decapitron " " puppet who 's head can morph into the ghost of Toulon.Another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry ( Part II , since III was a prequel ) . Suddenly , the puppets are back at Bodega Bay Inn , back in their case ( minus Blade ) , and Toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again ( he betrays them in part II for his love of Elsa ) . This isn 't explained AT ALL ... and so with that , and all of this other junk thrown in , I was no longer amused.I 'm a huge fan of ridiculous B movies , a connoisseur if you will . I even collect laser discs of rare B movies you can 't find on DVD , and so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies I have ever seen in my life . I still love those puppets , the original ones , Blade , Tunneler , Pinhead , Jester and the rest , and if they had only stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that wasn 't broken , well , the series might still be alive and in good health . That being said , even though the reviews aren 't so great , I 'm really interested in checking out Puppet Master Retro , sounds like an interesting one that pays great tribute to the original themes . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I thought this film was a poor effort by the British film council - fell flat as hey , come on , Tim Robbins is an old guy and here is this beautiful young woman who falls straight for him as well . Like lost in translation its really hard to suspend disbelief in this context . It 's a good looking film but lacks punch . When Tim Robbins is pretending to be psychic it looks like he has a small migraine . He looks uncomfortable and life less . The part where he is screening suspect employees at sphinx is laughable . If an investigator came to my factory the last thing I would do is tell him about my freckle fetish . It 's obviously over-intellectual . Clumsy . The city is as it is , a convenient backdrop . They obviously picked the most futuristic city they could ( shanghai ) as a backdrop but the city never really comes out and effects the characters as in for example blade runner , where the characters of the city often intersect the story. slow as a wet week .

" I 'd heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on DVD . There was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we 'd both heard that this was a terrifying film , really scary . How disappointed was I ? ? VERY ! ! ! ! Apart from that one scene ( we all know which bit ) NOTHING happened ! ! ! I was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes , like appear at the window or walk across the hall or something.Nearly all the reviews here say what a scary , gripping , atmospheric movie this is .

" A film with very little positive to say for it.Firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama.Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again . I lost count of how many times I had seen " " that " " field at night or that bit of cracked earth.It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don 't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused . So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it 's fine . We find Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre . Beth has a key to a warehouse of books ? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie , much later , in fact too late.And on the point of the acre . Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary 혯 and also if they 're meant to be an acre big then make them so.There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as Beth ( the best performer in the piece , followed by Jefferson 혯 the cop ) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on " " medication " . " With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child ( did he crawl out of the window ? He 's six months old ) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene . Bad plinky plonk " " horror " " music fails to add atmosphere.Often bad films can be amusing but not The Empty Acre , which is just bad . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I cannot BELIEVE anyone is giving this film a good rating . In addition to the terrible acting , thin ( nonexistent ? ) plot line and slooooooooow pace , this would be the movie to watch if you were really TRYING to fall asleep . The writer 's and director 's brains must have been fried eggs to ever have concocted something as abominable as this . Based on the plot summary on the DVD case , the premise really sounded promising . But within the first ten minutes I knew it was a lost cause .

" I have been living in Istanbul for 24 years and I ( a 39 years of experience would suggest ) do know what Istanbul has gone through all those years.Faith Akin is still quite young ( born in 1973 ) and falling in the great mistake of being ORIENTALIST when looking at Turkey ( just as his other movie Gegen Die Wand did ) This movie SERIOUSLY LACK contemporary urban Turkish life AND MISLEADS the audience when giving out ( quite false ) clues as to the geographical and cultural spreading of Istanbul.Anyone who could speak Turkish could easily attest that many underground bands & groups depicted in the movie ( Siyasiyabend for one ) are SO MISERABLE and their members cannot even speak a proper language that they cannot be taken as ' representatives ' of the contemporary Turkish music . Much less a piece of crap which many Turkish listeners even do not know about at all.We Turks have long been accustomed to ' superficious ' westerners who look at Turkey with some Orientalist point of view : trying to fit the actual Turkish image into their mind molds .. What is new in this movie is the fact that now a Turkish originated director ( Faith Akin ) is making the same mistake : Looking at Turkey with some false western glasses and scrambling to depict it as if he understands better . All of a vain effort.Just ask any Turkish friend of yours : What sort of a musical documentary is this without mentioning the names : Zeki Muren , Baris Manco , Ajda Pekkan , Teoman , Muslum Gurses , Ibrahim Tatlises , Ferdi Ozbegen ? .. and many others who have SHAPED so far the real MUSIC we are listening today ? Faith Akin has a long long lesson to learn before babbling away and confusing other people 's minds with false images about the contemporary Turkish Music . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Kindred opens to shots of a Porsche racing along a highway , it catches up with an old pick-up truck and gets held up . As it speeds past the pick-up the driver ( Benjamin J.Perry as Ben Perry ) shouts obscenities and honks his horn . Distracted he doesn 't notice an obstruction ahead and crashes his Porsche . He is quickly freed from the wreckage and is taken to hospital . On the way the Paramedic ( Randy Harrington ) trying to save him suggests that he probably won 't make it . Then the Ambulance is attacked and forced off the road by a van . The driver of the van , Jackson ( Jim Boeke as James F.Boeke ) beats the Paramedic up and steals the patient . The Ambulance driver , Harry ( Charles Grueber ) makes no attempt to stop him . Once the injured man has been placed into the van Jackson turns his attention to Harry whom seem to know each other . Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw ' last time ' . Jackson punches Harry to the floor and throws a bundle of money at him . The film then makes it perfectly clear we are in San Fransisco by showing a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge . Sharon Raymond is woken up by a phone call for her boyfriend Dr. John Hollins ( David Allen Brooks ) to inform him that his Mother , Amanda ( Kim Hunter ) who has recently had a heart attack has regained consciousness . Hollins works for a company called the ' Geneticell Corporation ' and is delighted at the news and heads off to see her . Once there she asks him to go back to his old childhood house in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all of her notes and experiments , especially the ' Anthony journals ' which Hollins has never heard of , she also claims that he has a brother named Anthony . Back at Geneticell , Hollins talks with a Dr. Phillip Lloyd ( Rod Steiger ) about his Mother as they had both worked together before they had a falling out with each other , and questions him about her research and if he knows of anyone called Anthony . He claims he knows nothing . When Amanda dies after a visit from the sinister Dr. Lloyd , Hollins decides to carry out his Mothers request and try to find out who Anthony is . While paying his final respects at the funeral a woman named Melissa Leftridge ( Amanda Pays ) introduces herself to Hollins and says she was a big admirer of his Mothers work and research after she helped her . Because Melissa seems to know so much about his Mothers work he invites her to the house as she may possibly be able to help find some answers to various questions he has . Hollins , Sharon , Melissa and three lab assistants , Brad Baxter ( Peter Frechette ) , Hart Phillips ( Timothy Gibbs ) and Cindy Russell ( Julia Montgomery ) plus a girl with a watermelon ( ! ) named Nell Valentine ( Bunki Z , great name what were her parents thinking ! ? ) . They get down to business straight away but find little of any interest . For some reason no one at this point thinks to look in the basement , which is just as well as there 's something down there , something large , slimy and has lots of tentacles . First it kills Duke , the dog . Then it moves on to larger prey . When Hart is attacked by something in a barn Hollins decides he must destroy all traces of his Mothers work and whatever Anthony is . Jointly co-written and directed by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow , Carpenter also acted as cinematographer and Obrow as producer . This is a pretty poor film in my opinion . The script is credited to five ( ! ) writers , Carpenter , Obrow , Earl Ghaffari , John Penny and Joseph Stefano and with five people working on it I 'd like to think they could come up with something a little bit better and more coherent than this . Nothing is explained that well , why did Amanda create these monstrous sea creature / human hybrids ? What is Dr. Lloyd 's interest and his motives ? Why does he steal bodies from the back of Ambulance 's ? Why does he have a basement full of mutants ? Why do none of these so-called genetic scientists think to check the basement out ? Could Melissa act more suspiciously even if she tried ? Why are none of the characters given any background ? Why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures called Hemocynine when 99.9 % of the audience isn 't going to have clue what their on about ? There is also a serious lack of blood and gore , only one person dies on screen , just one ! And all the scientists survive in a vomit inducingly mushy ' happy ending ' . This is a horror film guys , all we want to see is the slimy monsters kill and eat people in various gory ways . The one on screen death is actually quite cool , someone has slimy tentacles inserted under their skin , in their ear and up their nose in the films only decent horror sequence . To try and up the gore quotent there is a scene where Dr. Lloyd is experimenting on a skinned animal but it only lasts for a few seconds , and in the context of the rest of the film doesn 't mean a thing . Melissa also turns into a fish , don 't ask . There 's no nudity either , which isn 't a surprise . The film looks professional enough with decent production values but is just so dull and plods along at a snails pace , we don 't even get to see the giant monster in the basement until 15 odd minutes before the end which is far too little far too late , when it does make an appearance the effects are OK and that makes it even more of a shame that it wasn 't used more . Overall I was very disappointed and I was expecting a lot better . A horror film with only one on screen death and only three in total , what 's the world coming too ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Special sneak previews are always a good time . No matter what movie it is you are seeing , the theatre will always be packed by people who have been awaiting the film , like free stuff , thought it 'd be something to do , or just got lost . Either way , no matter how good or bad the film , the audience alone will make it enjoyable . Now when said movie is a PG-13 pseudo- horror film ( can you really delve into horror when the MPAA is on your back censoring everything ? ) you know there will be chatter , laughing , and breath holding . With The Messengers , the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous outbursts and warnings to the characters on screen . As for the actual movie , I feel sorry for those involved because it really could have been much better had it been paced right and allowed to stretch its legs beyond the scare / fade-to-black / show aftermath progression these films have . In the end we are shown a boring , plodding story with no surprises and few moments of actual suspense.The story is a common one . A family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try and rebuild their relationship with each other . Once settled in , the spirits of the house come out to the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for the parents to disbelieve everything told to them . Of course the child is not crying wolf and those around only find out when it is too late . I will credit the Pang Brothers , ( directors of the acclaimed The Eye that I would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without Hollywood interference혰supposedly reshoots on The Messengers were done by someone else , but the brothers retained credit ; it 's a shame what our studio system does to foreigners especially when it was creative independence which made the films that brings them in and not bottomline interference ) , for really having a fitting style and for keeping the tired plot line somewhat fresh . Unfortunately , though , I also must give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness . Similar to why I disliked What Lies Beneath , I couldn 't stand the drawn out suspense , which goes so far as to make it laughable . When our heroine and her brother stand in a hallway with a ghost behind them , the scene lasts about eight minutes with just static , oddly composed close-ups and depth of field focus changes to end up culminating to absolutely nothing . For being only 84 minutes , I almost think it would have worked better even shorter.Besides a very effective opening sequence , featuring the fantastic Jodelle Ferland , ( strangely playing a boy ) , and a great atmospheric credit sequence , the only thing that saves the film from utter garbage is the acting . Except for Penelope Ann Miller , who first made me wonder what ever happened to her and then , after a few scenes , made me understand why I never asked that question in the years she was absent , and Dustin Milligan , completely lacking in credibility , the acting is very strong . Dyan McDermott does a nice job as the father trying to keep his family together through all the tough times . He has many little moments of light comedy to counteract his serious , dramatic role . William B. Davis ( everyone 's favorite Cancerman ) is used effectively as an almost foreboding character , sadly not utilized more . Our true stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett . Stewart plays the emotion very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and Panic Room on her resume . As for Corbett , if he didn 't pull off his role , the entire movie would have unraveled completely . I do wish he would be given more work as I 've enjoyed him since the under-appreciated series " " The Visitor " " 혰I still need to check out his first role in " " Northern Exposure , " " a show I haven 't yet been able to catch up on . It 's a shame he will probably be most recognizable for the overrated My Big Fat Greek Wedding.If anything , The Messengers gave me a nice introduction to the Pang Brothers ' work and reinvigorated my desire to check out their Chinese horror catalog . The mood and performances were there ; it was just the simple and vacant story that needed way too much padding to make a feature film . If they delved more into other characters , rather than just Stewart 's , it could have been more effective while also having something more to show then ten minute scenes of nothing . If our protagonist is the only one being attacked , there is no suspense as to how far the creatures will go to harm her . The moments of danger had no gravity to them and until the ending really just stood in as filler . I am excited , however , for the free comic book given away after the special screening , as hopefully the medium will allow for a faster paced story that engrosses before it tries to surprise . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Blame it all on the weatherman , poor sod . The Deputy Prime Minister Campbell is a hard-ass that expects everyone to be clairvoyant , a most irritating character . If you are from the United Kingdom , or anywhere that it may flood , then you might like this film . It 's sort of like earthquake movies are most appreciated where earthquakes happen . This is not really an action film , where the weather is the enemy and you must conquer , or outrun it literally , it is more like a time-bomb that must be disabled . Looking at this movie , it is understandable why the UK thinks the world is overpopulated , it isn 't , but for them it is . Really , the movie is about as exciting as picking scabs and I can 't recommend it . It 's over 100 minutes , far far too long.The problems with the film ; I won 't get into them beyond this because the film doesn 't deserve such dissection . Hint to you Londoner 's - buy more boats . If you bring children to this movie they 'll either fall asleep or become uncontrolled bored screaming demons . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films , most spectacularly in " " Alien " " - and some decent " " he-man " " performances from the male cast . The possessed astronaut 's wife , to me , is the weak link in the ensemble - she doesn 't seem to know what to do with her face in a lot of her most prominent scenes , for which I blame director Corman . Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen play , " " Blood Beast " " might have been pretty decent . But the inherent cheapness of the production design and the continuity errors and gaffes undermine the proceedings . For instance , every time I saw the comatose astronaut laid out on an " " examination table " " the width of an ironing board , I broke into giggles , probably not the the emotion the crew wanted to invoke . And the monster 's costume needed some serious work ; fern covered parrots just aren 't scary or convincing.Still , the premise was strong enough that I hung on to the end just to see how the plot would resolve itself , and the alien 's motives were sufficiently ambiguous at first that I could sort of think of it as an enigma . And the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist had a bit of punch to it , along with the plot development where the alien claimed to have assimilated some of the dead man 's personality . It 's Corman . It 's cheap , fast , and mildly watchable if you don 't think too hard or expect too much . What more needs to be said ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie had good intentions and a good story to work with . The director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull , boring filmstrip that made me feel like I was back in Mr. Hartford 's 8th grade Social Studies class -- way back in 67.What a waste , will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it.Every time a scene had potential , all we were left with were a few clich챕s , combined with black and white footage that they probably got from The History Channel to show the action . Shameful.Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this dull fest . The other acting was incredibly dull - it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the Captain set a new low standard for line delivery.However , if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and aren 't concerned with being awed or entertained , but want to learn about the USS Mason , it is worth a watch . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I went through great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site . I really don 't have time to write reviews but I felt this was my duty as a sci-fi horror buff . This is only the second review I have written . The other was for Dracula 3000 . Now to the point . This movie sucked . Plain and simple . I kept wondering if I was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those " " lovely " " comments . I have seen movies with bad effects , bad acting , bad sound , you name it and I 've seen it . But this really sucked . I don 't care how much it costs or didn 't cost to make , movies like this and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder . By the way , Did I mention that this movie sucked . I mean really sucked . The plot was non exist and the acting was weak . It seems like the writer saw Pitch Black and got upset because he didn 't think of a plot like that first so he decided to make his own ripped off version . But instead , the suck factor took over and possessed him . DON 'T WATCH THIS . You 'll have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on burning coals . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

In reading other posts , I remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl , but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue.I was going , a stamp ?

" " " Extreme Makeover : Home Edition " " is yet another ' feel-goody ' , so-called ' heart warming ' , and out-for-ratings show that ABC has had the time to put together.I understand the troubles that these families go through . For that , I am sorry . But wouldn 't you think that putting four wide-screen plasma televisions , three flat-screen desktop computers , an inground pool taking up half of a backyard , and closets full of expensive designer clothing is a BIT too excessive for ANY family ? Sure , these families have been through a lot . Sure , they deserve nicer things that what they had previously had.But honestly , the things that Ty Pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough to suit an entire neighborhood.Another thing that really irks me about this show is how Ty and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family , or the family 's condition . Telling a wheelchair-bound person that he or she is ' so strong ' , or ' very brave ' really does get old after a while . That may sound rude , but believe me ; watch this show , and you 'll see what I mean.All in all , this show is overrated . If you want to watch it , go ahead .

" I considered myself to be quite melancholy , especially when I watch a great touching and tear-jerking movies . But not for this one ( which surprised me ! ) and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly.There are several disturbing facts throughout the movies : 1 . Despite guilt-ridden Ben 's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past , I find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action . Some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly , in the end this was a disturbing action to me.2. The movie story line is over-dramatized , but the logic is over-simplified . Medically , blood type match is required to be an organ donor . Toward the end of the film we learnt that Emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period . Nevertheless , it seemed that Ben had the rare blood type , same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently , despite the rarity of Ben 's blood type , he was able to donate not only his heart , but also his kidney , his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen.3. Why the doctors allow Ben 's organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself ? I might be over-analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie . However , some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie . If you go for a soap-opera type of film , go for it . But it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment , give this one a miss ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred , I felt that the film wasn 't the best I had seen . At the end of the movie I was left feeling like there was something missing in it.Bette Davis did a perfect job , though , and she made me hate her and pity her all the while . Leslie Howard did very good as the lovelorn Philip Carey , and I so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame . It 's such a sad thing when one finds him / herself in love with a bad seed . And especially if it 's someone like Philp Carey , who is a sensitive person , though pathetic.In the end , the acting was what came through and not the plot . The ending scene was particularly good , but I am not one to give it away . Although others may find this movie good , I was one who found it so-so . I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A film like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just doesn 't get it . They never did . And liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion.This film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons . The boy is understandably ridiculed until a bevy of professional athletes , led by former NBA star Alex English , join his cause . Not just a few of them join the cause . By the time his movement reaches its zenith , entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons since nobody will play any more . Just to move this review along , I 'm prepared to grant them this premise . Even though it would never happen in a million years , I 'll just imagine it could , then go from there.I don 't quite remember how , but some type of agreement is reached , and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene.Before criticizing the message of this film , let me just say that this film is poorly written , acted and directed . Even if one does agree with the boy 's stance , it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed . And that 's a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste . ( Peck , Curtis , Petersen ) . Alex English does as well as he could have with his character however , and I wish he would try to act in more films . Alas , it 's likely much easier to find work in the coaching world of the NBA . One wishes Mr. English would teach more of these thuggish NBA types of today how to shoot the rock a little better . Alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop.As far as the film 's message in concerned , it 's just wrong-headed . Plain and simple . All of those nuclear warheads tucked away in those missile silos out west PREVENTED WAR ! ! ! ! ! It would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the USE of nuclear weapons . These weapons were in fact never used , and that was the genius behind their existence . Neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile . Without these weapons , who knows what might have happened between the USA and USSR.The makers of this film obviously intended for kids in America to take up their cause and follow in Chuck 's footsteps . Kids in America however are more intelligent than the left wing kooks who created this dreck . The film is worth only 2 of 10 stars.If you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war , stick with Dr. Strangelove , instead.Mr. Newell , you are no Frank Capra ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The riddle as a concept is an interesting idea , but i 'm afraid is miscast , Vinnie if given the Hard man role is his element as in Lock Stock and Snatch . In this movie Vinnie plays a Newspaper sports writer ( greyhounds to be precise ) , who during the course of the movie is easily is beaten up with ease and bundled over a balcony by a man who 10-15 years his senior . I 'm sorry Vinnie is tough looks tough and has so to cast him like this is foolish . Trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the Thames . He takes on the role of policeman , whilst the real police are bit part players , interceeding with flashbacks from Charles Dickens.When Vinnie is on screen his reputation precedes him he looks tough but does 'nt in this part need act tough , snarling at the camera in parts . If you watch the Mean Machine , he is perfectly cast , and believable and does a very decent performance . Getting back to the movie what confuses the matter somewhat is the flashback to Charles Dickens who is narrating a different story with characters who are also appear in present day , these two stories are it appears unrelated apart from the same actors are used . The sound on the movie especially from Julie Cox is inaudible at times , and not really fleshed out what her role in the movie is short of Vinnies Love interest , she starts the film as a Detecive , but quickly becomes the Girlfriend.The Death of the Prostitute is sort of answered but yet / not answered . Strip out the Charles Dickens stuff and you may have a decent movie.Vinnie , is slowly becoming Britans Steven Segal , stick to the supporting actor role , your 'e quite good at it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I only today , picked this up at the 99 cents only store today , and I still think I got ripped off . " " Dream to Believe " " is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $ 1 is just too freakin ' expensive for this . This film is probably only notable for 2 things : 1 . It has a young Keanu Reeves . And 2 . It 's directed by Paul Lynch , the man who also did Promo Night . Now onto the movie . It 's about a girl named Robin ( Played by Olivia D 'Abo ) who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father 's life . So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments , she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named Tommy ( Played by Keanu . ) Robin , when not in training , works part-time , along with her mother and stepsister , at a Laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather . Eventually she is chosen to compete . Overall , Keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star , and it 's also not one of the worst movies ever , but still far from good . The DVD itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old VHS and towards the end , the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over , it fades to black , even though sound can still be heard . So this can probably be passed as a bootleg . The DVD artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie , as it 's also not in the movie itself , so the cover 's obviously photoshopped . In any case , avoid at all costs , unless you 're a Keanu fanatic . I probably won 't be hanging to it any longer . I 'm probably gonna give it to The Cinema Snob , who 's a great YT critic btw . Hey , if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight , feel free to donate to him to keep his show running . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What more can I add ? This is without doubt one of the worst films I 've ever seen . Terrible acting , a daft script , tediously slow pace - even visible microphones dangling from the top of the screen . I could go on , but I really can 't be bothered . I watched this for 90 minutes before the sense of losing the will to live became too great for me.I can only assume that the first set of comments and votes were from people associated with the promotion of this insult to British film-making.And worst still , I had to buy the Mail on Sunday to get it : - ) The only reason the DVD hasn 't now been redeployed as a coaster is that it now takes pride of place in my Top 10 Worst Films Ever collection.Definitely one to be avoided . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I really hate most end of the world movies .

" Don 't get me wrong , I like the idea of a story that explores throwing off the system of social order and testing people 's mettle in the face of horror , and I do believe some people would act like this film portrayed , but sadistic idiots aside , I seriously doubt society would just dissolve into every man for himself , that 's just insulting . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The first film is somewhat good to me , I enjoyed it for the most part , but I thought it was really nothing all that special . However , when compared to this mess it looks a whole heck of a lot better . Why they felt the need to make the movie is beyond me , but they should have known it could not match the acting of the first movie when they only could get Ruth Gordon back to reprise her role . The story kind of follows Rosemary 's baby around and stuff , but in reality it is kind of a mess , it does not help that the movie is a television movie and the television look shines through very well . It has more of a comedy tone to it as well which hinders it greatly , if they really felt the need to make a sequel they should have made it an R rated movie that had some nudity and gore in it . I am sure it would have still been quite bad , but at least it would have been more watchable and fun which this movie is not despite its trying to be funny . I saw this one on Monstervision and Joe Bob had nothing really good to say about it in the intro and I do not have to much to say either .

" I saw this movie just recently , and I said to myself : " " This movie is bad ! " " William Shatner is a great actor , but he is no director ! It 's not just that the acting is bad , it 's terrible . And instead of a plot , we have a very bad storyline that is called a plot ! What I really thought was bad was at the beginning where Kirk and McCoy were teaching Spock how to sing " " Row , Row , Row Your Boat ! " " Do I have something against William Shatner ? I do not . But when it comes to being a director , he sucks ! This film is not one of the worst movies I have ever seen . But it is the worst of the Star Trek series !

I regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when I could of saw something better . The beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches . They exaggerated the way love works in reality . All of the girls were stereo types . The boyfriend was too stupid for his own age . The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs . The bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies . Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . Hey why didn 't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead ? It might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie . This movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed . This movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive Christian people nuts .

" Having seen the hot Eliza Dushku in the pretty good Wrong Turn , I decided to pick this one up instead of Return of the Living Dead , of all movies . Haven 't seen that one yet , but , considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever , safe to say I made the wrong choice . There is simply nothing to recommend this movie , and I am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut . It didn 't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend . It simply made no sense , held no excitement , had very little interesting acting or compelling writing . The release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running , and the reason is obvious . The whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly , to meaningless effect . Get Wrong Turn instead , if you want to see Dushku . I would like to see a movie with her and the super-hot Elisabeth Harnois--but I don 't think even that would have made this movie watchable .

The voice is crap , the face is a bad rip-off of Legolas , the posture is horrible , and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them . Said to say , I was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco , because I was hoping from then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only . Too bad I was wrong . These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance , and they are the main reason I give this a 4 .

" Rudolph Mat챕 's film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80 's , Dexter Cornell ( Dennis Quaid ) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career , but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage . The initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him , so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned , we are not that surprised , unless of course you are familiar with the original . Dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live , decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students Sydney Fuller ( Meg Ryan ) , but they find they have many obstacles in their way.The film begins promisingly in black and white , as Dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder ... his own , but the Huey lewis style 80 's beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad , its only a question of how bad ? Sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium , but now the film resorts to full Technicolor . There are some brief homages to Noir , as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind , but there 's really nothing here to recommend it , the performances are awful , Ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine . The film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise , obviously trying to cash in one the Body Heat audience , the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure , they are welcome to it . 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries , and agree that it does have its pros , not only its cons . For example , the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage , including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the love affair of Paul Atreides and Chani , which , on reading the novel , is a travesty , probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes . This was one of the great failings of the original film , and the miniseries , to its credit , does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the Lynch film due to the expansive nature of the Herbert novel.However , this in itself is a double edged sword . Rather than complete a text-to-celluloid transfer of the novel , the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines , absent from the original novel . Similarly , although this is surely a " " fuller " " account of the storyline of Dune , it is also a break from the originals heart and soul & main vision - that of prophecy . Where are the internal monologues that characterize Herbert 's writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking , without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint , or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues ? Gone . So much of the original agony of Paul 's decision to choose the jihad or death , the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it , surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself ( and one which captivates people who are far from Science fiction fans ) is missing . Without prophecy , what is the point of Dune ? It is simply a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda . How sad that this is all we are provided with . Lynch 's film was flawed , yes . But a flawed film could lead to a correction by another film-maker , taking on some of the best points of Lynch 's film-making and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline . Now this story shall probably never be translated to film again , and this I find heartrending . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often . The plot is unrealistically convoluted , the actors sport bad accents and director Robert Altman 's participation amounts to collecting a pay check . Once again he has assembled an impressive cast ( Like Woody Allen , everyone wants to work with Altman ) that this time around to the letter is miscast . But that 's only part of the problem.Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder a high powered Georgia lawyer who in the film 's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex-husband and a loony dad . With red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way . Fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that 's not enough there 's a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale.Branagh plays MacGruder with a mealy and unconvincing Southern accent . Running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he 's blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going . Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is every bit as bad as a P.I. but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent . Robert Duvall as the old man is Boo Radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible . The female leads ( Embeth Davidtz , Darryl Hannah , Famkhee Jansen ) are lean leggy and unemotive . Even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos ( Vernon Jordan ) are wooden with the few throw away lines they have.In addition to paying little attention to his actors , Altman 's mise en scene dripping with Spanish moss is murky and shapeless , his action scenes comic book . It lacks his offbeat touches and observations ( he does inform the viewer that the Stars and Bars still wave in Georgia ) that make a well done Altman so unique .

" CHE ! is a bad movie and deserves it reputation as an unintentionally funny film . It takes a serious subject and presents it like the Cliff Notes version or Classic Comics because there isn 't much emotion or a proper narrative--just episodic segments stitched together with mostly stupid " " true stories " " relayed by a variety of yutzes.This is a deservedly derided film , as it is poorly written and acted . However , what I have found most interesting about the film is its apparent gay subtext . Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working towards a Communist Cuba , they seem to be more of a gay couple--with Che behaving coy and aloof and Fidel as the ardent suitor ! Again and again , the film abounds with great lines such as when Fidel implores Che " " Cuba needs you .... I NEED YOU ! ! " . " I am not sure if the studio intended this homosexual undercurrent , but it doesn 't take a brain surgeon to recognize it ! I am very surprised that the other reviewers didn 't point this out . However , if you remember this when you watch the film , it makes viewing much more exciting and even funnier.A final note . In recent years , Che has been very chic--even a fashion statement with hoards of brain-dead teens , who have no idea who he was , wearing shirts emblazoned with his face . Considering he was a cold-blooded killer and nihilist ( an odd combination for a doctor ) , this new reverence for the man is gross . What will they do next , put Hitler or Dr. Mengele on T-shirts and posters ? ! ! ? Even Communists with consciences should be appalled by the bloodshed Guevara was responsible for and I find it ironic that people with computers are championing a man who might likely have killed them given half a chance ! Considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was , it does nothing to further the message that Guevara was no hero . I would love to see a realistic film done of his life--with the good and the bad but also with dialog and a plot that weren 't apparently created by chimps ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The DVD release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of Sandra Bullock . Her picture ( from years after this film ) basically is the cover art ... and the back cover art ... and the inside cover art ... the same picture . Her name is prominently shown on the front cover , all 4 edges and the disk itself . She is the first name in the list of stars . Her biography is printed inside the case . This film must revolve around her character , right ? WRONG ! It is her first movie and she plays a minor role . After watching the movie , every role seems like a minor role . The character Dog actually displays some personality . Less than an hour after watching it , I don 't even remember the names of many characters.Maybe if I watched it several more times , I could actually figure out the plot , but I don 't think it would be worth the effort.Oh , wait , I just remembered a funny bit ! Shoot-em-up video game fans will get a kick out of the " " Doom-cam " . " Looks just like a first-person shooter game . Hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera.I am generally not a person to be critical of movies , but this may be the worst movie I have ever seen . I kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen , sit down and start making fun of it.I 'm just glad that the money we spent on this ( used ) went to charity . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hip . Erotic . Wickedly sexy ... whatever . It 's " " The Terminator " " with werewolves.No , seriously . The cop saves the girl ( waitress ! ) from the big monster and refers to himself as her ' protector ' . The lead actor Ryan Alosio does a pretty good job of emulating Kyle Reese ... there 's a massacre in a police precinct ... the bad guy is muscular with red eyes ... and it even contains dialogue along the lines of " " You said it yourself , he won 't ever stop . Never . " " The dire script comes from a first-time screenwriter who , thank God , hasn 't sold anything since this , and it 's all thrown together by famously bad director Richard Friedman.The movie opens in a strip bar ( always a good sign ) , and a mean-looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason , pursued by three cops . One of them is black , and ( shock horror ! ) he 's the one who gets killed in the first five minutes . The film goes downhill for the next hour or so , then picks up a little with some decent action sequences , before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending.For the most part , the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who 's willing to settle for less . If nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and Alosio , along with some of the supporting cast , shows signs of talent . DarkWolf in his human form is played by gargantuan Kane Hodder -- famous for his numerous portrayals of Jason Vorhees in the ' Friday the 13th ' movies . He 's decent enough , especially considering he isn 't used to speaking roles.It 's become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams , who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former ' Power Rangers ' actresses . And it 's unnervingly clear that the editor spent WAY too much time on that scene ... anyway , the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good , and the design of the wolf isn 't bad at all.But the CGI is bad . Just plain bad . I mean seriously , if you can 't reach some level of realism - why bother ? Just throw a little extra money into the make-up ! Aside from the terrible script , this movie does have it 's moments , many of which are unintentionally funny . It 's good for a laugh if you don 't have anything better to do , but just don 't spend any money on it . Please . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Right away , this film was ridiculous . Not that it didn 't have redeeming aspects혚 For example , the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery . Anyone not living on the East Coast should know the South doesn 't have beautiful mountains like those found in the West . I knew it was Utah right off the bat , but perhaps Dalton couldn 't suppress his English accent , so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town . Subverting his accent into a Southern one was easier . Sure the film has plot twists , but its phony sense of place was something I couldn 't get past . It 's not like Utah doesn 't have meth labs ... so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the South is beyond me . One other thing in action pictures always puzzles me . Why do they always make the " " cocking " " sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic handgun ? It seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a " " chuk-chich " " signifying a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire . Of course , the weapons already had rounds chambered so this was unnecessary . Lastly , the pyrotechnics were WAY over the top . But hey , this film was targeted to a certain ' market segment ' I suppose ... It 's too bad . Each of the actors can act , but this film was lame . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Brodzki 's creation is a great example of how NOT to make a movie . First there was a book written with a great humor . Book that has numerous fans who would be happy to supply help when producers for some reasons decided to employ people who hardly heard of the book in the first place . Then came a script as humorless and full of nonsense as possible . At the same time the script was written in a way to allow only those who actually had read the books to understand anything of the plot . Not that anything in this movie made much sense anyway ( ex . " " I 'm like an ice shard . You can burn yourself " " said Yennefer as a word of warning - warning that logic is something this movie seriously lacks ) . To add to that we have to mention that no matter the amount of money that was supposedly spent on the movie everything looks like an amateur production with two ( 2 ) computer effects one of which is a see-through dragon . Even the costumes look as if the were borrowed from a really poor theater . That is the better ones look this way . And to add to that we have a few ' naked scenes ' put there only so they will be in the film because they have no explanation in what one may mercifully call plot . The movie has only one strength that can hardly make up for the rest - music is not bad . Though if I was to choose I 'd prefer to have it separately . It sounds better if you don 't have to look at this failure of super production . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'd really have to rate " " Sex is Comedy " " as one of the worst pieces of dreck I have ever seen . The film inadvertedly showcases those which are the worst aspects of the French , or at least how they are stereotyped , narcissism , snobbery , and pseudo-intellectualism . I myself am French-Canadian and feel slightly ashamed that the creators of this film are from the same culture as me , that should give you an idea as to how bad this movie really was ! One doesn 't so much watch this film as undergo torture to it , there was a total lack of humour , and it seemed to me as if the entire film was a documentary interviewing people who were neither famous , nor talented , as if to celebrate something that has never happened to begin with . Instead , why not watch Auberge Espagnole , Happenstance , or Je t 'aime ... a la folie , three fantastic modern French films . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I like Brad Pitt enormously . He is an actor with brains and wit , not to mention face , pectorals and all the rest . Since I saw him in " " Thelma and Louise " " a thought has been bothering me , who does he remind me of ? " " Troy " " did it for me . He is the new Brigitte Bardot . The differences are obvious of course . Male , American etc but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind nonetheless . He is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it . " " Kalifornia " " " " 12 Monkeys " " " " Fight Club " " " " Snatch " " His self deprecating humor makes him human , almost accessible . Fortunately " " Troy " " will soon be forgotten . Only still photographs with Pitt , semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans . Strange , " " Das Boot " " is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th Century . What is Wolfgang Petersen doing directing this ? Well , I suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new Brigitte Bardot . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from Hollywood because oftentimes in Hollywood it 's all just a popularity contest . It also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content . Yet , this film is overrated and overblown . Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous . No way do Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar rated performance so many have raved over BEFORE the film was even out . I can 't even believe that Condon is being set up to be nominated for a Directing Oscar when all he did was put together an album . Glitz does not replace a nothing storyline . A bunch of songs does not a movie make . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The best scene of " " The People Across The Lake " " is the genuinely creepy , nightly opening-scene featuring a house , a murder & a lake . After that , it 's pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned . A family ( mom , dad , sister & younger brother ) is fed up with the ( mildly ) dangerous environment of suburbia , and decides to go and live near the titular lake . From then on , the film features too much lame happy family-related doo-doo near the lake , with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there . The couple of scenes where they discover the bodies , are pretty convincing ( in terms of creepiness ) , but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goings-on ( featuring just every-day-life stuff of the family settling in ) . The truth to the matters ( the mystery as to who 's doing the killing ) is learned too soon , leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale ( featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house ) , like if this made-for-TV thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film . It 's not really badly made ; the content & story is just not interesting enough . The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin , though his performance / character is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious . Blond cutie Tammy Lauren ( the daughter ) might be a recognisable face for avid horror junkies too , as she also starred in " " Wishmaster " " ( 1997 ) , and made-for-TV outings like " " I Saw What You Did " " ( 1988 ) & " " The Stepford Children " " ( 1987 ) . She hasn 't got much to do in this film , though . Skippable , but watchable , if anything . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm sorry , but for a movie that has been so stamped as a semi classic and a scary movie , but seriously , I think when the director has me laughing unintentionally , that 's not a good thing . The characters in this film were just so over the top and unbelievable . I just couldn 't stop laughing at Issac 's voice , it was just like a high pitched whiny girl 's British voice . Not to mention Malicai 's over dramatic stick up his butt character.Children of the Corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a God that commands them to sacrifice any 20 + aged people . When a couple has a bad car accident they come to the town for help , but of course they get caught in the kid 's trap and are getting sacrificed ! But Malicai has other intentions when he is sick of following Issac 's orders.Children of the Corn could 've been something great , but turned into a bad over the top movie that you could easily make fun of . As much as I love Stephen King , I 'm sure this is not what he intended and it was a pretty lame story , or at least the actors destroyed it . Like I said , for a good laugh , watch it , but I 'm warning you , it 's pretty pathetic.3 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this movie on the film festival of Rotterdam ( jan ' 06 ) and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards . Many people reacted shocked and protesting . He will get a lot of negative critics . But : the world is cruel like this , and it 's not funny . People don 't like it . That itself doesn 't mean that the movie is bad . I can see that difference . Don 't shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our ' hubble ' ! Nevertheless I think this a bad movie . Film-technically it 's a good one . Nice shots and script , most good fitting music , great actors . The director pretends to make a psychological movie , - the psychology however is of poor quality . Describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art . The art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence . How does a shy boy come to such a cruelty ? The director pretends to describe that , - but is not good in that.The director used several times the word the ' selfishness ' of people , mentioning for instance the teacher . Only : this teacher wasn 't selfish , - just someone in several roles , caring for his pupils , 찼nd worried about his script . I think it 's a simplification to call him selfish . The atmosphere in the village is creepy , and the mother made awful mistakes ( ' you terribly let me down혚 ' ) but it doesn 't become believable for me , that there is caused s첬ch a lot of pain , that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things . In fact , reality is far more complex than the way , this film describes 혯 and it needs far better descriptions . The interesting thing would be : how does it work ? Describe that process for me please , so that we understand.With the written phrase on the end , the director said to point to an alternative way of life . It was the other extreme , and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists , promoting black / white-thinking . The connection between violence in films and in society has been proved . Use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right . There are enough black / white-thinkers in the world , causing lots of war and misery . I hope , this movie won 't be successful . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The previews were so funny that I couldn 't wait to see this movie . I just got home and I have to say I couldn 't have been more embarrassed at this movie . Yes there were times where the jokes were funny , but the stereotypical roles were painful . Joan Plowright is a fine actress but the scene with the " " negro spiritual " " was just in poor taste .

I would say that it wasn 't even something as simple as mini digital video . There are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has , like through editing etc .

" Well , I 'll begin with this : I love horror-movies , not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present . Second ; this is the worst movie of all times . It even beats Mean Guns , and the attack of the killer tomatoes . And for that I pay it homage.However , the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed , after which point everything was so so sad . To my great surprise , the reviews where somewhat divided ; and you guys who rated this piece of C-movie-crap from 7 and up ; I KNOW YOU 'RE JOKING ! GOOD ONE ! ! HAHAHA ! Because if there is any reason in the world , and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is ; you can 't be for real.Everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up , so I 'll leave it .

" No laughs whatsoever . Yes , I watched this entire train wreck but only so that I wouldn 't later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part .

What amazes me even more though , is to read the other reviewers ' comments , which acknowledge this isn 't very good , yet then turn around and give it high votes . If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one , then I certainly pity your torturous existences . The humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids , yet the subject matter does not . So who is this for ? People who enjoy repeated & drawn-out double-takes , pratfalls , drug jokes ( interesting only as a short trip back to ' 77 ) , and other " " low " " humor . The Three Stooges are still funny , and were to me as a kid , too . THEY exerted some effort in making jokes work . This however is sloughed off schlock .

" This movie was terrible . You couldn 't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie . It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene . It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced . Worse than all Dean Cain films combined . To start , the acting was terrible . I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor , but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent .

" After some internet surfing , I found the " " Homefront " " series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited , the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago . The resolution and quality are poor . The images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look . Although the commercials were edited out , the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program " " Nightline " , " complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990 's . Even with the poor image quality , the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.To this show 's credit , the casting was nearly perfect . Everyone was believable and really looked the part . Their acting was also above average . The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler ( most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong ) . The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets , especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and d챕cor . The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time . For example , conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes . The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations . That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago . Despite all the ingredients for a fine show , the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start . For one thing , the name of the show itself is totally misleading . When WWII ended in 1945 , there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a " " homefront " " either . Curiously , the first episode of the show " " Homefront " " begins in 1945 after the war had ended . That 's like shooting the first episode of " " Gilligan 's Island " " showing the castaways being rescued . The whole premise of the show 's namesake is completely lost . I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no , the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 . Additionally , this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940 's . By the third episode , it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda . The show is set in River Run Ohio , near Toledo . However , the show 's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio . Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams , Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr. who portray the Davis family . Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil " " whites " " to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable . The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years . We get it . We 're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis . The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show , as it was for " " Homefront " . " The acting talents of Williams , Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical " " frightened / angry black family " . " The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something . The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing , and leave it at that . Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.In yet another ridiculous plot line , the big boss of a local factory ( Ken Jenkins ) is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees . The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.Personally , I think this series had great potential . The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 혯 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories . Of course the loss of brothers , sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama . The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to Europe or the Pacific . The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless . But no , the writers of Homefront ( David Assael and James Grissom ) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots . Instead , they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics . It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I kept watching and many questions are raised , were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did ? Lots of questions asked ... and then dropped .

" Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama ? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women . Fine . It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man . Fine . There are a few antics between them . Fine . But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie . It continues in this vein for a while until , in the end , it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter . But by now it 's too late . It 's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing . Truly a lesson ( for British filmmakers anyway ) of how not to make films .

" I have neither read the book on which the movie is based , nor the letters between Vita and Violet . If I came to this movie with any expectations whatsoever , it was maybe that the Bloomsbury group ( including among others Virginia Woolf , and which the Nicolsons were part of ) would be depicted . It wasn 't , which however wasn 't a problem for me . What I am wondering about is how the people behind this movie managed to make it , in my opinion , so very uninteresting and repetitive and most of the characters flat , in spite of great material and some very good actors . The script is simply not good enough . I agree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbor - too many pointless sex scenes ( but only between the women , while there is nothing explicit whatsoever concerning Harold 's numerous love affairs ) , too many pointless scenes in general , too little information about the background of characters . It seems odd considering the quality of the production - on the surface it seems a really ambitious piece of work , but the script holds of course the most weight and that is where this movie fails.Vita 's relationship with Harold struck me as unconvincing , although both of them act really well , especially her . The way they kept declaring their unconditional love for each other in a rather sappy manner I thought , well , simply unconvincing . It makes a lot more sense that it should have happened through letters , as tmmvds points out I would also have liked to know where the nicknames came from - the Russian ones * as well as Mar - why ever is someone called Vita given the nickname Mar ? It might be small stuff , but it matters in contributing to the bigger picture . * I watched the movie with English subtitles on , and where it should apparently have said Mitya , it said instead Medea . That might explain my frustration with the nicknames to some extent - I could not understand why Vita 's should be Greek while Violet 's was Russian ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The reasons they go about this don 't make sense . There isn 't enough character development to explain why . What shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at . It is mentioned that war is the final creative expression , quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have , and it makes no sense.The characters who go on a murder spree aren 't fighting the institution , they 're just killing people . I thought they might 've used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end , that would 've made greater symbolic sense , but they didn 't.tl ; dr - This movie is an adolescent 's daydream of fighting against authority that plagues them , though in reality they need . It has no moral , symbolic truth , or meaning to it ; this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in " " power " " that annoy you.If you think a murder rampage / school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you don 't like , then I guess you 'll love this movie . If you 're like me and you 're working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly ( very blindly in this movie ) rebelling against " " the man " , " this movie is juvenile and boring.You can also tell in parts that funding was lacking , and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder.All in all , this seems like a very rough draft of what could 've been an okay movie , but no effort is put into the dialogue , character development , or moral so it 's just ... poorly done.If ... only I could get my two hours back . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Band Camp was awful , The Naked Mile was a little better , and this third straight to DVD in the American Pie franchise seems the same quality as the predecessor . Basically Erik Stifler ( John White ) split from his girlfriend after losing his virginity , and now him and Mike ' Cooze ' Coozeman ( Jake Siegel ) are joining Erik 's cousin Dwight ( Steve Talley ) at college . With the promise of many parties , plenty of booze , and enough hot chicks at the Beta House , they only have fifty listed tasks to carry out to become official privileged members . But a threat comes into sight with the rivals , GEK ( " " Geek " " ) House , led by power-hungry nerd ( and sheep shagger ) Edgar ( Tyrone Savage ) offering bigger and better than what Beta have . To settle it once and for all , Beta and Gek go into battle with the banned , for forty years , Greek Games to beat each other in , with the loser moving out . The last champion of the games , Noah Levenstein aka Jim 's Dad ( the only regular Eugene Levy ) runs the show , which sees the people unhooking bras , a gladiator duel floating on water , catching a greased pig , Russian Roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse spunk , wife carrying and drinking a full keg of alcohol ( with puking not disqualifying ) . It all comes to the sudden death , with a guy getting stripper lap dancing , and they have to resist cumming , Beta House win when Edgar cums with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap .

" The plot of this movie hangs on one important point : that this murderer was also a responsible , loving , caring father . Not that being a father and a murderer is impossible . But this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion . This girl was someone 's daughter . I don 't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold-blooded to someone else 's daughter . Or , alternately , could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter . And the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victim 's parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief.That said , the characters were acted with conviction by the actors . I thought changing Scott Bakula 's eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is . You couldn 't see into his eyes at all . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yeti : Curse of the Snow Demon starts aboard a plane full of American high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in Japan , unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the Himalayas . Unlucky really . With some dead & some alive the survivors have to think about themselves & decide to wait it out until help comes . However just when they think their luck couldn 't get any worse they soon discover that a huge , hairy Yeti type Abominable Snowman creature wants to kill & eat them all . Trapped , cold , starving & fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time ? Yeah , with a title like Yeti : Curse of the Snow Demon it can only mean one thing & that is that someone at the Sci-Fi Channel has made yet another ' Creature Feature ' although to give these things a bit of variety the Sci-Fi Channel here in the UK are now dubbing them as a ' Beast Feast ' ! As if that will make any difference . Directed by Paul Ziller one has to say that Yeti : Curse of the Snow Deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time , sure it 's bad but it 's sort of fun at times too . The basic premise is alright actually , it 's a sort of cross between Alive ( 1993 ) with it 's plane crash & the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive & the excellent gory killer Bigfoot ( another legendary hairy monster ) exploitation flick Night of the Demon ( 1980 ) which I would defend with my last breath & I have to say it 's not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as I said it 's fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written . The character 's are mostly annoying American teens , there 's the expected arguing , there 's the macho hero , the strong female & the coward who thinks only of himself so there 's no prizes for originality . There are some plot holes too , if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them ? How are you going to dig a large hole & line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes ? Why did the Yeti not kill that bird at the end ? It had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her ? The ' there are actually two Yeti 's running around ' twist isn 't used to any effect at all either . At least there 's a good pace about the film , it certainly moves along at a fair old pace & I never found myself becoming bored with it . There 's some moderately gory action & the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not & if they are going to eat their dead mates or not.The one thing you can always say about these Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Features ' or ' Beast Feasts ' is that the CGI computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious & so that proves to be the case yet again . The plane crash at the start looks awful & the Yeti when it 's CGI looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it 's on a pogo stick . There one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm , a squashed head , a ripped out heart , some dead bodies , some blood splatter & the best bit when the Yeti rips a guy in half & beats him with his own ripped-off legs before biting a big chunk out of them . According to the IMDb the actor playing the Yeti took three & a half hours to get into the suit & the make-up which seems like a long time since it 's actually a pretty tatty looking creation . Apparently the original title was Raksha : Curse of the Snow Demon with Raksha meaning demon in Tibetan Sanskrit , so now you know.This has reasonable production values considering the usual Sci-Fi Channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh , bleak Himalayas & was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere & during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm . The acting isn 't that good & I didn 't think any of the girls looked that good either which didn 't help.Yeti : Curse of the Snow Demon is another terrible Sc-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' if I am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn 't too bad & there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it 's not very good . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The idea of Seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept , indeed one could see Seagal play a good serial killer however making him a cop who has a ridiculous penchant for prayer beads and razor sharp credit cards comes off more stupid than likably ridiculous .

This was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that I was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the UK . The style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it . All you have to do is read all the positive comments ( not a single negative that I can see ) to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination .

... " a recommendation ! Gloria Grahame runs the kind of orphanage where discipline is imparted with a meat cleaver , orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them and the bodies are kept in the deep freeze so that they can be brought out for when social services call . That the orphanage is strapped for cash we know because Gloria puts all the orphans to work , and also because there don 't seem to be enough clothes to go round - especially for the older nubile female orphans ( age range appears to be 12 - 30 ish ) . The new arrival , however , turns out to be more than a match for Gloria - and has indeed just taken out her own mother & mother 's lover ( in a witty claw hammer and arson opening scene ) . Predictably , Gloria ends up on a meat hook herself . This one was made for about tuppence but was / is a HUGE HUGE HUGE hit on the grindhouse circuit .

" I can 't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb . This is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen that wasn 't an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . The plot is predictable . I couldn 't bring myself to care about any of the characters . The dialog is cheesy . Several moments in the movie actually made me groan out loud ( including Kiefer Southerland 's crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie ) . Jeff Bridges ' accent is goofy - I can 't tell what country he 's supposed to be from . It has to be one of the least thrilling thrillers I 've ever seen as well ... after Sandra Bullock 's character disappears , absolutely nothing happens to advance the story for a good 45 minutes .

" This is easily the most disappointing , least gratifying movie of the entire so-called blacksploitation genre , which , by the way , are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home . Rather than being " " exploitation " " or demeaning , these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era . Well , not Bucktown.In this story , Duke returns to Bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother . He quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force , bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses . Duke resists , and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police . Unfortunately , he does so by calling in a posse of his friends ( these people are vaguely explained as some former black-militants who have worked with Duke on " " jobs " " in the past ) and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood . And literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it . Ignorance is not a justification for murder , and it would have been much more entertaining to see the Cracker Police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street . While revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre , it is a far cry from seeing Pam Grier track down the thugs who off 'ed her family , cuss them out , give them a jujitsu ass-kickin ' and set their ' fro on fire . That has art ( and a reason for existing ) and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back . Of course , in this bizarre tale , she is playing a woman completely under The Man 's thumb , afraid of the Crackers who run her town and oppress her people . Indeed , her advice to Duke is , " " Run , man , they gonna kill you ! " " Following the sickening and gratuitous violence , we are expected to believe that the town 's mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of Duke and his friends , congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor , as opposed to , say , calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody . Duke 's posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree . They immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their Cracker Police predecessors ( to quote the mayor , " " They are ten times worse than what we had before ! " " ) . Now Duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of Bucktown from corrupt , protection-racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets . Unfortunately , Duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero , as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force . I wouldn 't have cared one way or the other if he had rescued Bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point . I suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way Duke has to outsmart the new Police Goons , but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence , Duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the Cracker Police . Duke is a pig.Finally , when everyone in town but Duke , Aretha , and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin ' in the street , our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values ; they don 't . Duke is merely a murderous thug and Aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice . If you are interested in this genre of film , by all means , I highly recommend them , see Coffy , Foxy Brown , Truck Turner , Blacula , Sheba Baby혚but if in the process you should run across this DVD , throw it as far away as you possibly can ! Drop it like it 's hot ! It should be treated as one would treat a glowing puddle of nuclear waste ! There is no single film in the entire Blacksploitation era that is not dramatically more entertaining , satisfying and populated with more sympathetic and admirable characters than this piece of slime , obviously written by and targeted at some hormonally imbalanced high school sophomores . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Effort aside ( This isn 't a review about good intentions , its about the final product ) , this film is poorly written , overacted , and poorly directed . The story obviously had potential , but that story is nowhere present in this film.Clara Barton was a human being . She had passions , desires , love , pain , embarrassment , weakness , and self doubt just like the rest of us . You would never know that from this film of the lead actress 's performance . In fact apply that to every character in the film , but in Barton 's case : Every sentence is a speech . An epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot . In fact the only scene that plays well in one in the board meeting , and I realized thats because she 's making a speech ! Every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot . For example , when she sees a wounded man , she 'll start pontificating about the needs of the battlefield and to protect soldiers and putting up white flags , etc . As played in the film , there 's no WAY she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in seconds.IN conclusion , this film robs Clara Barton of her struggles . It robs her of her humanity , and it inherently cheapens all she did because the script is written in clich챕s . The writer doesn 't know Clara Barton , and seems to have based his script on an encyclopedia Britannica article . ( yes they had those back then ) But hey , nice Technicolor !

" I saw this film numerous times in the late 60 's / early 70 's whenever it reared it 's head like a reindeer with rabies every November-December as a Saturday matin챕e kiddie show.It was always stiff competition for THE CHRSTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN 'T ( oops-can I SAY " " Christmas " " ? ) , perhaps the greatest , most iconic Christmas-season film of all time.But that 's another review.At the time , I marveled that the on-screen tint of SANTA CLAUS was almost " " pink and white " , " so much had the color of the sprocket-torn prints changed color.The film is kinda creepy ! I thought so then--and still do , actually . I was highly entertained then , as I still am ! It 's amusing in a " " retarted-elf " " sort of way . By the way , the image quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater , circa 1969-74.If you are expecting maybe " " the lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special-forget it ! If you want FELLINI DOES Christmas--read on ... By nature , the dubbing on these foreign films ( the original version here was in Spanish ) always makes them seem " " surreal " . " This adds to the films inherent oddness . It is also pretty scary in that a " " mishevious demon " " ( as described in the original US trailer ) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids " " evil " . " One particularly nightmarish scene has a young " " latch-key " " boy wishing he had parents for Christmas-suddenly the " " port-a-family " " emerges out of giant " " Christmas presents-of-the-mind " " until he realizes he 's just daydreaming !

" I can 't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you can 't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London : An American tourist visits a famous European capital , he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague , he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession , he turns into a werewolf , he 's visited by apparitions of his dead victims , etc etc . and reading the previous line I 've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is With this Paris based movie there 's no scenes that really stand out . There 's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he 's going to get back home with no money or clothes , there 's no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there 's no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour ? I 'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he 's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there 's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist 's fate and dilemma in the London movie , here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There 's also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren 't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world 's press ? Why haven 't the police got leads ? Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower , it 's painfully obvious that it 's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won 't put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it 's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn 't stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn 't need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Being ( somewhat ) an independent filmmaker myself , I really understand what these guys were trying to do and it sounds like a good idea . On paper . On 16mm film , however , it 's awful . I didn 't realize the thing was made in the mid 90 's because the film was so grainy and bad I would have sworn this was one of those 30 year old flicks where a porn producer tried to go mainstream . And the sound ! Ugh , I don 't know what kind of mic they were using to record but it sounds like someone is walking over dead leaves throughout the entire thing . I guess I shouldn 't judge too harshly , after all , how many feature films has MY company put out ? None , but I 'd like to think that we 'd at least have good picture and sound quality to go with our poor acting , writing , and directing .

" The story behind this movie is very interesting , and in general the plot is not so bad ... but the details : writing , directing , continuity , pacing , action sequences , stunts , and use of CG all cheapen and spoil the film.First off , action sequences . They are all quite unexciting . Most consist of someone standing up and getting shot , making no attempt to run , fight , dodge , or whatever , even though they have all the time in the world . The sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004.The CG features very nicely rendered and animated effects , but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used.Pacing : everything happens too quickly . For example , " " Elle " " is trained to fight in a couple of hours , and from the start can do back-flips , etc . Why is she so acrobatic ? None of this is explained in the movie . As Lilith , she wouldn 't have needed to be able to do back flips - maybe she couldn 't , since she had wings.Also , we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car , and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror , and then stabbing herself in the throat , all for no apparent reason , and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car ( and then felt the secondary effects of another , exploding car ) ... " " Are you okay ? " " asks the driver " " yes , I 'm fine " " she says , bloodied and disheveled.I watched it all , though , because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end , the poor execution made me wish for anything else : Blade , Vampire Hunter D , even that movie with vampires where Jackie Chan was comic relief , because they managed to suspend my disbelief , but this just made me want to shake the director awake , and give the writer a good talking to . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Everybody knows that Gregory Widen 's original " " The Prophecy " " didn 't really require a sequel , but you also don 't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash-ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable . Part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel , meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action , more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery . The only good news is that the producers managed to keep Christopher Walken for the role of Gabriel , and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental . If it wasn 't for Walken 's performance ( and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like Brittany Murphy and Glenn Danzig ) , " " The Prophecy II " " surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release . The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth . The purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse Valerie Rosales ( Jennifer Beals ) from getting born . For you see , her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly " " monkey " " and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of Gabriel 's evil dominion . Thus , just as in the first movie , he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts Valerie all the way down to the Eden for the final showdown . " " The Prophecy II " " is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don 't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity . Whenever the storyline becomes too tedious , the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant Christopher Walken moment to distract you . His interactions with the rebellious Izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences . On a slightly off-topic note , I often felt like " " The Prophecy II " " ambitions to look similar to " " Terminator II " " 혚 Gabriel 's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the Eden location , where the final battle takes place , looks very similar to the steel factory where " " Terminator II " " ended as well . Coincidence , I guess ? Overall , this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you 're a fan of Christopher Walken 's unique acting charisma ( and who isn 't ? ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and raciness of its predecessor , " " Gold Diggers of 1933 . " " The Production Code was firmly in place by the time of this film 's release , so the humour is all of the hokey , wocka-wocka variety and gone are the dry one-liners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping off the lips of the gorgeous dames from the first film . A cast of second-tier stars and character actors go through the motions here , and the " " puttin ' on a show " " motif seems awfully forced ; instead of the make or break world of Broadway , the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel . Who really cares whether or not the show goes on ? The score here is bland too . Of course the movie 's big number is " " Lullaby of Broadway , " " which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about a New York socialite 's eventual demise from too much partying--doesn 't exactly have the same effect as the searing " " Forgotten Man " " number used as the finale in ' 33 . Busby Berkeley directs as well as choreographs this film , and whatever promise is built up in the film 's fluid opening scenes quickly deteriorates . Unfortunately , no one learned any lessons from this , and there was yet another Gold Diggers movie two years later.Grade : C- , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" May I start off by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work very much . I wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent . With this said , Soul Survivors was a very , very bad movie . Very bad.I would have to say that I lay almost all the blame on the poor script . Affleck is a very talented actress , Wes Bentley had an outstanding performance in American Beauty , Melissa Sagemiller did well , and Eliza Dushku is currently the it girl in Hollywood . I don 't think any of the actors really got into the script , and I understand why . To say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement . It did have the twists and turns you would expect , but they just didn 't lead anywhere ... except to more confusion . I just found the ending very anti-climatic , because it just didn 't seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that I had about the storyline.I wish I could give this movie a good review , but I can 't . In all honesty , the only thing I think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Some movies are just 혚 unlucky . These are the films that obviously thrived on a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas , but simply didn 't have the budgetary means and / or professional cast and crew members at their disposal to make it happen . " " The Strangeness " " definitely belongs in this category . You really want to like it , but even the most tolerant and undemanding 80 's horror fanatics will have to admit the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity due to its atmosphere of cheapness , clumsy stop-motion effects and impenetrably dark cinematography . " " The Strangeness " " has a fairly original plot and setting ( okay , it 's similar to " " The Boogens " " but I sincerely doubt that director David Michael Hillman intentionally ripped off a fellow insignificant 80 's B-movie ) and the players deliver enthusiast performances even though they 're all miscast . An assembly of amateur speleologists go on an expedition to explore the infamous Gold Spike mine . Many years ago , several miners mysteriously died there and the place has abandoned ever since , but there 's supposed to be too much gold hidden there to remain closed forever . Shortly after they descended into the mine , the group members one by one encounter the slimy ruler of the Gold Spike mine ; a Lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly cheesy way of moving forward . Throughout most of its running time , " " The Strangeness " " is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the complete lack of lighting . The characters are uninteresting and the mine remains a mystery because the only lighting effects come from the helmets of the speleologists . There 's very little action or horror to experience in the first hour , but director Hillman cleverly grasps the viewers ' attention by showing bits and pieces of the monster at regular intervals . As soon as you catch the first glimpse of the monster 's tentacle , you 're doomed to keep watching till the very end . The creature is realized with stop-motion effects , which I usually adore and worship , but here in this case they look extremely weak and pitiable . The person responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of Ray Harryhousen . The death sequences largely occur off-screen and there 's very little suspense throughout the whole movie . A horror flick with a setting like this should benefice from claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects , but " " The Strangeness " " lacks all this . The biggest trump of the film is unquestionably the beautiful appearance of blond actress Terri Berland . She resembles a speleologist as much as I resemble Mother Theresa , but she surely looks good in her tight white top and beige pants . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Well , you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick both are really good actors . But WTF with this movie ? The story was lame and the script was just terrible . The poor actors didn 't have material to work with ! The DVD cover invited you to a flight action flick . You would expect something like Top Gun ... Huge disappointment ! The flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you puke . The aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources , not made for this movie . And they didn 't even care about the marks or the fighters models , taking for granted the audience will not notice it.As I said the story was lame . With a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting . In short , it seems a B-movie made in the 70 's.I feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here . They sure must be ashamed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " May contain spoilers " " Sadly Lou Costellos ' last film has the distinction of being slightly better than Abbott & Costello 's last movie together " " Dance With Me Henry " . " This movie isn 't all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire . Dorothy Provine is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable . You can 't blame Lou Costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the " " green " " light . In my opinion Lou Costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the IRS . If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies you can notice the magic was gone . Check out " " Dance With Me Henry " " now that 's a painful movie to watch . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" ' AfterLife ' is about a somewhat arrogant , reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying , and finds himself looking after his sister , who has Down 's Syndrome . He can 't be bothered with her , and basically just wants to get her off his hands ; he has better things to do . At one point he finds that he has to take her , by car ( she doesn 't like flying ) across the country.If that all sounds familiar to you , it is probably because you have seen ' Rainman , ' a film far superior to its imitator , ' AfterLife . ' That it copies the basic premise ( heck , it nicks a few characters and even scenes too ) is not the fundamental problem with the film . The fundamental problem is that I did not care about these characters.The brother , Kenny ( Kevin McKidd ) , is a bit of a womaniser . He has a girlfriend who comes and goes in the story , and who learns to like the Down 's Syndrome sister ( again , this is taken from ' Rainman ' ) . He is a journalist , trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal . When he ends up looking after Roberta , the sister , he doesn 't have much time for her , and sometimes leaves her alone for a little too long . When she wanders off , he becomes even angrier towards her . Am I spoiling anything by saying that he becomes a nicer , loving person by the end of the film ? Roberta is not determined to be ' normal ' ; she is ' normal , ' and wishes people would stop treating her differently . She is played by Paula Sage , an actress who does have Down 's Syndrome , and her performance is easily the best thing about the film ; why did the screenwriter not explore her character more ? Well , probably because that would mean the characters would get in the way of the story . When we surely already know the story anyway , didn 't the filmmakers see the problem they were creating ? For a film about a dying mother and her handicapped daughter ( the father is absent ; I think he is dead , but I 'm not sure ) , it is surprising how little impact the film has on the emotions of the viewer . The scenes are performed in such a standard , dull way , with such standard , predictable dialogue , that I found myself rolling my eyes.I have nothing against sentimentality in films , but it only really works if you care about the characters . Here the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I didn 't really think there was much to care about . ' Rain Man ' has an emotional climax , but that moved me , because I cared about the characters.Talking of climaxes , this film has a stinker . There is sequence at the end of the film that starts off as an unbelievable situation and ends up in even worse territory ; an unforgivably cruel trick is played on the audience . The sequence is designed to move the audience , but ends up being horribly manipulative and offending the intelligence of the viewer . Audiences aren 't stupid , and they know when the film is cheating . What a cheap shot.There is not one scene in this film that has the impact it should . There are a few sequences that are funny , yes , but when the characters talk to each other , I can practically see the screenplay in front of me , moving predictably and uninterestingly , never hitting anything that touches the mind or the heart . There are those phoney arguments that are reserved especially for the movies , where the other character knows exactly what the reply is . Why don 't supposedly ' realistic ' films not realise that , in real life , anger can be irrational , and sometimes people can 't express their emotions , and they might say things that don 't make sense , or not be able to say anything at all ? All of the actors in this film deserve better material . This film is not based on fact , but I think a documentary on a family with a Down 's Syndrome member would be much more interesting . That way , we might have had truth and emotion . For some reason the characters in this film think that an emotion only involves saying something loudly and making a suitable facial expression . * * ( out of 5 ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is essentially a " " how-to " " on how to be a well-connected pedophile . I 'm amazed that so many people-- especially other gay men-- have seen this movie and read the book and no one has brought up the fact that if Weber was not an influential photographer , he would be in jail , doing time for child abuse . Poor Peter Johnson . Weber took this poor , naive ( although incredibly handsome ) teenager whom he found at a training camp for high school wrestlers in the Midwest , brought him to live in his home , and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him , many of them full-frontal nudes , all through Johnson 's teenage years . That ain 't art . It 's child abuse . And what 's worse , Weber made lots of money off of it , and poor Johnson is going to have serious " " issues " " the rest of his life . Weber 's lecherous love of the boy is downright creepy , as are his ramblings about famous ( and not so famous ) people he 's known , as he tries to complete Johnson 's " " education . " " Creepy , and then just plain boring . The only redeeming thing I can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self-deception .

" Someone , some day , should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films ; of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions , searches for secret passageways and crypts , trackings of monsters through air ducts , and so forth . Offhand I can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout-- " " Demon Seed , " " " " Cube , " " the remake of " " Thirteen Ghosts " " --but it 's at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt ; it 's all about the character and the affect of spaces , passages , and walls . So I was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central . The idea is this : An architect has built--actually , rebuilt--for himself a huge and rambling house ; his wife has just left him , mainly because of his own self-centeredness , but also , it is intimated , because she can 't get used to the place since he remodeled it . Living in unaccustomed solitude ( real this time , rather than virtual ) , he comes to suspect that somebody else--a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared--is living into the house with him ; only the place is big enough so that he never sees him.This is a good start for a melodrama , whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these : After searching the house for the intruder a few times without success , the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches , trying in various ways to surprise , intercept , or ambush the intruder , maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure . Meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didn 't foresee or doesn 't remember . The movie would turn into a cat-and-mouse game , a hunt , a battle ; and finally , in trying to trap the intruder , the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation , in some way he didn 't expect . Then he would be forced to think himself out of it--and maybe at the same time out of his own self-imposed isolation--and in a final twist would nail , and maybe even kill , the * * * * er.Nothing like this happens in this movie ; the house is just a house , the architect is just a guy , and his nemesis is of an unknown character , if he exists at all . Here is what does happen in the movie : Once the intruder is installed in the house--if he is--the architect begins hearing noises , but when he goes to investigate finds nothing . He calls the police , they think he 's slightly nuts ; he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night , she thinks he 's more nuts . At last , more or less accidentally , he runs into the intruder ( doesn 't get a good look , but figures , who else could it be ? --not a hard question , in a story with , to that point , fewer than three principal characters ) , whereupon he locks the doors , lowers the grills on the windows , throws away the key ( I don 't know why he thought this necessary ) , and leaves his victim to starve . I missed why this was a given : the doors and walls are made of steel ? In any event , the architect takes to sleeping in his car . And since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further , something else must be devised to take its place . And this is it : The architect--are you ready ? --moves into the house of the man who ( presumably ) moved into his , and lives there in the same way . How is this possible ? It is not , but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so : The architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door ; and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him ; and while sitting in his car , he throws the picture into the street ; and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like Martin , their neighbor ; whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way.If this sequence seems to verge on the implausible , what ensues plunges right in . The architect takes up residence with Martin 's wheelchair-ridden wife , unbeknownst to her ; so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that he 's able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around . Throughout this section the movie is clever in one way , making ( or leaving it to the viewer to make ) the point that his life with this stranger , who doesn 't know he 's there , is in essence the same life he lived with his wife , as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer . But at the same time , his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into Raffles the cat-burglar entirely incredible . Not to go into the series of twists at the end--including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door--this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair ; two nice people who take murder in stride ; and ( before the story started ) the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses .... To the final , long-anticipated twist , the movie adds another , to make it even more offensive , and then ... ends.Here is a story that depends on the development of two things--the idea of the stranger in the house , and the character of the man whose house it is--and fumbles both . The first fumble makes it boring ; the second made me angry , as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path , and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one : Martin the tunnel-builder and sneak-tenant . The story should be redone by someone , some day . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
... " If you 've been laughing too much for a long time , and need to take a break.After reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show , I decided to turn it on and check it out for myself . Everything that each of those people have said about this show is absolutely true . Mind of Mencia is like a half hour version of Mad TV , but with somehow worse jokes.One skit I had the displeasure of watching was " " The Second Annual Stereotype Olympics " . " What 's funny about black guy who has trouble swimming , or gay guy named " " Sparkles " " that wins a banana eating contest ? Neither of these concepts is particularly novel , insightful , or amusing . Do we really need a joke about Star Wars every episode ? That movie came out like 30 years ago . Mencia 's solution to funny things up is toss in some stereotypes about Hispanics and throw a few " " beaners " " in there ; and call it a day to go home to roll around in his pile of money . Pure comedic genius.Then he blatantly ripped off Jeff Foxworthy on a second show I watched , with a " " Your gay if ... " " bit .

" As you all may know , JIGSAW did not make its way to Blackbuster because of a member of Full Moon 's own staff , Devin Hamilton . Devin is the one who sells to all of the video chains . He recently released a movie , BLEED , which he was selling to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW . He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to take any JIGSAW , and double the number of BLEED . The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop , and BLEED looks like a hit . The major problem with that is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever , and as we all know , JIGSAW is , well , gold . I urge all of you to go on to the BLEED page on the internet and vote for the movie that wronged JIGSAW , and all of your talents . Likewise , you should go to the JIGSAW page and cast high votes for it ( if you already haven 't ) .

" The movie was watchable while Nicolson was on the screen . However , I had to fight against passing out from boredom when the film depended on Meryl Streep to carry scenes without Jack ; she was as bland as could be . The relationship between the characters was nothing special ; these characters have been portrayed before -- and much better . It felt like a based-on-real-life scenario in the absolute worst sense : 90 % of daily life is boring , and not worth writing about or watching . Why Ephron felt her life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about escapes me . Perhaps she wrote it as therapy -- for many writers , putting an episode from their life on paper is cathartic .

" If you have been to the east of Europe ( or even in their armed forces ) , you might find this movie interesting . I don 't know why calls this a comedy ( sure , there are a few funny moments ) , but it is not a good movie if one of the orderly officers talks for 15 min about the achievements of socialism on a Christmas dinner , and the officers in general act like funny oafs , the soldiers are running of the base to meet their girls at night , and surprise , surprise , one of the girls is the daughter of the commander . The east German army was known for its abusive and humiliating service of its conscripted men , and the comedy was basically not filmed on the facilities or with the equipment to make a good movie of the east German army and their time now gone by . Despite this , some of the actors and actresses tried to act well , but it came out only in the roles they 're known for from East German TV and some small films .

" Roger Corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career , spanning over 300 movies . While few ( if any ) would call him great , his films ' obscure connections to underground culture ( via reference , tribute , or influence ) have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts . Throughout his career , he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films ( " " Piranha " , " " " Humanoids from the Deep " , " " " The Black Scorpion " , " etc . ) , without improving on them in the slightest . " " Raptor " , " " " written " " and " " directed " " by " " Jay Andrews " " ( Jim Wynorski , the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures , " " Chopping Mall " " ) takes that practice to a disturbing new low regarding Corman 's mid- ' 90s " " Carnosaur " " trilogy . Wynorski 's credits are in quotes because " " Raptor " " isn 't a tribute to the " " Carnosaur " " films , and not even a remake . " " Raptor " " IS the " " Carnosaur " " films , or at least the film 's dinosaur-induced death scenes , haphazardly spliced together with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes ( many of which consist of " " dino 's eye view " " shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious ) . The " " new " " material was written around the footage , instead of vice versa , and is totally unremarkable , with huge gaps of logic ( e.g. two separate teams are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts 2 and 3 , where the soldiers had different uniforms , could be included ) , which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the " " Carnosaur " " films already . The actors ' lack of any feeling in their characters ( though in fairness , any character dimension is only presented in the script once , maybe twice ) brings to mind the terribly wooden acting in 1950 's b-films , and it certainly doesn 't make anything between the ripped-off attack scenes worth watching . Even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical build between the new actor and the actor in the original scene . When the only scene evoking any response in a film is the oldest trick in the horror book , the " " spring-loaded animal " , " something is seriously wrong . As it stands , this is a despicable practice in two b-grade figures ( who need not worry about ruining their reputations , because they haven 't got one ) ripping off their own material , for the cheapest and quickest of dirty tricks , simply because they can ( why else would anyone feel possessed to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the " " Jurassic Park " " series ? ) . There isn 't much more I can say other than that this film carries my very highest recommendations AGAINST viewing ; the only good thing about it ( besides gazing at Melissa Braselle 's navel ) is that now I don 't have to see any of the " " Carnosaur " " movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is one of the worst movies I 've seen in a while . The acting was just soooo bad . Anthonie Kamerling is usually a fairly good actor , but in this film , he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper . Especially his voice over was extremely wooden . Beau van Erven Dorens was completely over the top as frat boy Fraser , although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue . ' Ik ook van jou ' is an adaptation of a book , and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue . It all sounded way to bookish.Some of the situations were very badly visualized . Example : somewhere at the beginning of the film there is a scene where a canoe goes over in a rapid . This bit is just too incredible to be true . You see an obviously rather shallow bit of river , with a lot of rocks right beneath the surface ( hence the rapid ) . We hear some suspenseful music to warn us that there 's danger ahead . A canoe with to girls goes over in that rather shallow rapid . Our hero then dives several meters below the surface to rescue one of the girl . Girl swoons in his arms and utters the words ' You saved me ... ' Vomit ! It actually was so bad , that it became funny . This is sad , because it really wasn 't intended . At the intermission I overheard some guy behind me say ' O god , there 's another part ! ' My feelings exactly . What scares me is that the end credits of ' Ik ook van jou ' were in English . Does this mean that it will be released abroad ? Just when the Netherlands were starting to get a good reputation after films like ' Antonia ' ( Antonia 's line ) and ' Karakter ' ( Character ) ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" THE CHOKE ( aka AXE in the UK ) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight-to-DVD movie . I say " " supposedly " " because the title of the movie does not have the " " V " " in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie ( even though it does have the appearance of one ) .The plot is simple 혯 a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one.I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece , but this does not excuse the faults here . Even straight-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE ( which has a very low IMDb rating ) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called " " so bad , they 're good " " movies . However , THE CHOKE falls far short of being either a serious slasher ( such as HALLOWEEN ) or being a " " so bad it 's good " " movie ( such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE ) .The movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill . The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget . But , from there onwards , it 's downhill all the way.There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them . But , a few obvious ones stand out and I 'll go into them.The aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around 50 people present but after the music stops , there seems to be only around 8 people left ( and yet they 're all meant to be locked in ! ) .The characters in this movie are not likable at all . Most of the band members are aggressive foul-mouthed morons or just downright weird . No one really cares about what happens to them , and even their supposed friends forget about them when they 've been dispatched . The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church ( seriously ! ) . He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason . But sadly , even his presence can 't save the movie.There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation . Around 65 minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking . Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation . As in other straight-to-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND , the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all . There are plenty of over-the-top outbursts ( mainly from the male characters ) and one nearly results in a full-blown fight . In fact , the format could be said to go as follows : characters walk around--murder takes place--characters walk around--murder takes place . You get the idea.The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f-word being used . Perhaps this was meant to be funny , but it just comes off as sad . And more to the point , we have all seen this done a thousand times before ( usually to much greater effect ) .The movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all . The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger . A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons . They make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves . And much of the time , they don 't even pretend to be scared.In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE , the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed ( with the exception of the final murder when the killer 's identity is revealed ) . A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question . There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time . In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE , this served to make the film funny ( unintentionally of course ) , but here it is not funny at all.And , as another reviewer has pointed out , the soundtrack includes music that is very bad , even for those who like punk rock . The extras look uncomfortable dancing to it . The score ( at the end , there is no music at the beginning ! ) consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie.Don 't misunderstand the points made in this review . This reviewer likes bad movies ( such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE ) as much as the classics ( such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH ) . But , it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either . And even as straight-to-DVD movies go , this is a poor effort.On a positive note , the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes . But , when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously , these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion.Fans of the traditional 1980s B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie . And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything in their power to avoid it ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This has to one of the most pathetic , predictable and badly acted films I have ever seen . Clint Eastwood has never been worse , never have I seen somebody less convincing on screen . I was laughing at him the whole way through . Then there 's this romance kinda thing between him and the gorgeous Rene Russo , which was even more pathetic than the one between Mr.Connery and Ms.Zeta-Jones in Entrapment.One IMDb user posed the question : What 's not to like about this film ? I 'm asking : What is to like about it ? And the answer is : John Malkovich . He is an absolute genius and probably the best movie villain ever ( He even saved Con Air you know ) . But that 's it . This movie is called In the line of fire , but ' Bodyguard 2 : the rip-off ' seems to be a more appropriate title . Watch only if you are a die hard John Malkovich fan . Otherwise , avoid at all cost . * 1 / 2 ( out of five ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book " " Requiem For A Dream " " and co-wrote the screenplay to Aronofsky 's movie of it . That movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate , and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them . " " Last Exit To Brooklyn " " still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives , but it hardly does them the same justice Aronofsky did.The film seems laughably anti-gay at times . Especially when in the film homosexuality equals death . One gay character gets stoned , is launched skyward by a speeding car , and lands dead on the pavement . Another is crucified and still more are simply beat up . Another exaggerated piece of shock value , that might actually have been compelling if it were done well , are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike-breakers . Who 'd have thought a drama about Brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions ? The director , Uli Edel has a skill level like that of a TV director , but he is far below the cut for real movies . The film is clunky that can 't even seem to settle on a genre . Lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and Baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part . And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as our lead , a loathsome hooker named Tralala ( believe it or not , I 'm not joking ) . Her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least . Poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is , and also takes the " " real " " edge off the more provocative bits . A failure . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There are bad movies , movies that are horrible , and then there 's a tiny , rarified body of movies that are so horribly bad that , even after seeing them just once , the sheer awfulness makes it impossible to forget them even decades later . This is exactly such a movie , and it 's hard to believe that the original film in this series was actually quite good . Let 's see , George Kennedy , the cigar chomping " " tough guy " " mechanic of the original has somehow been promoted to airline captain , and , after the Concorde comes under missile attack ( don 't ask ) , he resorts to stunts like shooting a flare gun out the cockpit window despite ( presumably ) flying at Mach 2 , all the while doing the sort of wild high-G evasive maneuvers that would have ripped the wings off any real airliner , never mind the effect of the passengers ! But the absolute worst part of the film , at least to dedicated airplane buffs like myself , is that this atrocity " " starred " " one of the coolest , sexiest , and most technologically remarkable planes ever to fly . The Concorde ( or , just plain " " Concorde " " as its pilots refer to it ) deserved far better , this abomination is the equivalent of taking a high class beauty like Audrey Hepburn and putting her in a " " Porky 's " " sequel . Thankfully , the release of the ever hilarious " " Airplane ! " " the following year brought the whole " " Airport " " franchise to a well deserved halt , as anyone even contemplating a fifth installment would have been laughed to death by studios and movie fans alike . 1 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Mind you , it 's not supposed to be , but it is . As a wee tot , I watched this movie in the theatre ( Being a huge wrestling and Hulk Hogan fan ) . All I remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater , and that I didn 't really like it very much . I blacked the rest out , and for good reason.A poor film on par with the greats like " " Gymkata " " and " " The Pumaman , " " " " No Holds Barred " " is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling . Well maybe the stakes aren 't all that high ... and quite frankly I feel dirty just calling these people " " professionals " " at anything . And really , except for the first scene , there 's no wrestling to speak of . So I guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beating-the-c * * * -out-of-people . Sounds good , right ? Hulk Hogan plays Rip , the champion of the WWF ( Never let it be said that Hulk Hogan was typecast , this and movies like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents ) . Essentially he 's playing himself , but with a wardrobe that 's more black and blue than the Hulkster 's red and yellow . He also has this hand gesture he does . It 's kinda like the ozzy devil sign people make at rock concerts , except you stick your thumb in the air , and you curl your index finger in . My friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an " " R. " " Try and see for yourself . If that looks like an " " R , " " well , then , Mars needs women . But anyway.Kurt Fuller , with his overacting detector obviously on the fritz , plays a TV exec with his slightly homoerotic heart set on getting Rip , who 's evidentally bigger than Elvis , on his network . He won 't have any of it ( And exits the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one but the camera ) , and so the movie follows Fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at Rip . He does so when he creates his brilliantly titled " " Battle of the Tough Guys . " " Marketing genius , this guy.From the numerous hand gestures , to the rather idiotic fight scenes ( All played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious ) to the overacting , to the far too frequent shots of Hulk in nothing but undies , this movie has everything you 'd ever want in a dumb movie . It 's frivolous , not too taxing on the mind , violent , and includes the phrase " " What 's that smell ? " " " " DOOKIE ! " " " " Dookie ? " " A classic for all time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century . Way before the ' Scary Movie ' series there were a few examples of this genre , mostly in the 80s . But like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss . Some like ' Elvira , Mistress of the Dark ' mostly rise above that , but other like ' Saturday the 14th ' and it 's sequel fail to deliver the laughs . But out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that 's ' Transylvania 6-5000 , ' a major waste of time for many reasons.Pros : A great cast that does it 's best . Some of the dopey humor is amusing . A corny , but catch theme song . Some good Transylvanian locations.Cons : Threadbare plot . Mostly tedious pacing . Most of the humor just doesn 't cut it . The monsters are given little to do and little screen time . I thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies ? Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry.Final thoughts : This is a comedy ? If it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between ? Comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor , not roll our eyes and yawn , aching for it to be over . I can 't believe Anchor Bay released this tired junk . I 'll admit it 's not one of the worst films ever made , but it 's not worth anyone 's time or money even if you 're a fan of any of the actors . See ' Transylvania Twist ' instead.My rating : 2 / 5 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year . You should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here , there are SPOILERS . Gray Matters centers on Gray and Sam Baldwin ( Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh ) . Only Gray and Sam are Brother and Sister ; living together in everyone else 's eyes as man and wife . No sex but just about everything else . Early on , the movie starts with its theme : ' the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions ' . Gray and Sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch . Rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him , she does it and gets to the nitty-gritty questions too . When she signals her brother to come over they start a 3-way date . Charlie ( Bridget Moynahan ) is the girl of THEIR dreams , like all the right things etc혚 Sam final hits Gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal ! That Charlie accepts ! In one week Charlie , Gray and Sam are to be in Vegas . In the next week Charlie and Gray are off shopping for wedding gowns ( apparently Charlie has an off-the-rack figure ) . Gray is slurping an iced latte when Charlie suggests Gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a $ 10,000 frock for her . While Charlie is zipping her in this ' down-payment-on-a-house ' gown Gray continues to slurp on the latte ( I swear it was like a feed bag ) . What should happen but ' woops ! ' latte all over the gown . It is never explained how they got out of Bloomingdale 's bridal salon with out a $ 10,000 mocha colored gown . Back to ' reality ' 혯 Caesar 's palace Las Vegas . They have the ' high roller room ' ( Sam is a resident surgeon and Charlie is an intern zoologist 혯 were do they get all this money ? ) Gray kicks Sam out to the single room down the hall so she and Charlie can have a bachelorette drink-a-thon were , you guessed it - they kiss . Gray remembers everything ; Charlie remembers nada . They make it to wedding chapel and right when the Reverend gets to his line " " If there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds " " Gray gets the hiccups . Gray excuses herself , for some reason the Reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again ' hiccups ' . Gray gets back to NY and starts dating any man she meets , literally . And of course one is you guessed it again ! Gay . The other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver ( Alan Cummings ) named Gordy . He is smittened with Gray but the feelings are not returned . They become great friends . This is good because when she comes clean with Sam about the kiss . He blows up and kicks her out of their apartment . When Sam comes to his senses he goes to her office . Gray works at an ad agency . This office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone . It has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency . Sam gets Gray in one of the conference rooms for a not-so-private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office . This is where I doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew : Gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar . ' Sorry no men ' says the bouncer . So Gray and Gordy return with Gordy in drag . Bad drag . He was in a sleeveless black satin-like blouse , a string of pearls , and a grandma 's church hat . No lesbian would ever confuse this ' man in a dress ' as a drag queen much less a woman . The bar was also the straight man 's fantasy of what a lesbian bar is : full of Victoria 's Secret models . Everything turns out peachy 혯 she goes home with her firm 's client . Gray happens to be on the woman 's account and finally does more then kiss . For some reason no one tells Charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with Gray , but that is for the sequel . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" His significant charisma and commanding presence are about all that keep this afloat , but Fred Williamson has done far better urban action films including many of his later , vid-released fare . The big studios ' Williamson films of the early-to-mid 70 's rarely had the punch of their mid-level counterparts , and this is a prime example . Clumsy action , little violence , and the PG rating is nowhere near questionable . Worth a look for Hammer completists in any case . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Frederick Forsyth 's books are always so intricately plotted , with twists and turns , and usually a great surprise ending . This adaptation had none of that.So much of what was great in the book ( the history of Monk and the betrayed agents ; the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian election ) were completely missing in this adaptation . Instead , there 's this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner.Forsyth 's protagonists always operated in the shadows , forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists . The joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission . This film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early on.Swayze 's Monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying " " I AM A SECRET AGENT " " for all the attention that he called to himself during the film . And with all of that attention , the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising.Granted there was some energy to this film , which is why I 'm giving it a " " 3 " " instead of a " " 1 " . " It was also great to see some underutilized pros like Patrick Bergin , Ben Cross , Michael York , and Barry Morse.I hope that someday , someone will once again do justice to a Forsyth film adaptation like " " Day of the Jackal " " did . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the film makers but it just won 't do as a film about Vietnam . Viet Nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day in and day out.This film stars Gene Hackman who is Korean war vet assigned to train a group of rag-tag Viet Nam Vets for a return trip to that country to rescue a group of American POW 's held at a camp there . These men include a former tunnel rat , a crazy acid dropping sailor , a blond tanned surfer from California and some inexperienced kid ( Patrick Swayze ) who just so happens had a dad that was killed in Nam . They train first at some camp in Texas and once in Nam they are found out and lose all their weapons . They are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men . Most of the men are found and saved but the rag-tag group is mostly wiped out.This movie played like a video game in which you could figure out what was going to happen next and who would pop out of behind what bush , and who was going to die and who was going to live . Viet Nam I 'm guessing was not like a video game .... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If this film were to be rated on a scale of 1 to 10 , one would need to create a new rating system , as this one should not even qualify . The film 's plot , ( if you can call it that ) revolves around Charlie ( Stephen Baldwin ) , an ex- special operatives agent who is being targeted by the brother of a man he killed while he was still working for the US gov 't . If this sounds like an interesting scenario , please don 't be fooled , as this film will not deliver that which its action-themed story suggests.Comedian Chris Rock once said that when one sees an actor doing a bad film that it makes one want to send the actor $ 50 , given that the actor must be desperate for money to be doing such poor quality work . After watching this film , you may want to send Stephen Baldwin $ 100 . It appears that Baldwin did not put any effort into his role in the film . In the film , Baldwin is forced to run all over the city of Los Angeles in order to protect his " " honeycomb " " ( wife ) from being murdered by the brother of a man he previously killed . However , throughout the picture it appears that Baldwin can barely pull off maintaining a light jog . His laid back performance succeeds in subtracting from any suspense that the film might have intended to portray . If you are the type of person who enjoys watching very bad films and laughing at their shortcomings , than this film is for you . However , if you are looking for a well made action thriller , it would be best to look somewhere else rather than renting this film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is is a thoroughly unpleasant , if slickly made , movie . I tried it because it stars Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum , two good actors , and because the plot line - a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution - sounded promising . The movie is billed as a comedy , sorta . What we have is an endless series of shots - you should pardon the pun - of people in dimly lit and elegant , if somewhat surreal , interiors , shooting each other - in the head , stomach , kneecap , foot , heart ( no part of the anatomy is avoided , it seems ) while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue , some of which is supposed , evidently , to be humorous in a sort of post-modern way . Goldblum 's dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card , and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic grin - throughout . Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can . Burt Reynolds does a cameo . The credits list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop , but I somehow missed them ( good move on their part ) . The whole thing is cold , sterile , mechanical and unsavory ; an heir , I suspect , to the style of ' Pulp Fiction ' , ' Fargo ' and ' Natural Born Killers ' . If you liked those , you 'll probably like this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In 1932 , Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown--an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films . And , because he was an unknown , the movie they gave him was clearly a B-movie--a quick film with relatively low expectations . After seeing it , I could see why it would still take Bogart many more years AND another film studio before he became a household name . While the film isn 't terrible , it certainly isn 't good--making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today.Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company . However , when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way , his dreams all seem to go on hold . As one of the characters in the film said , the combination of the two is like oil and water--they just don 't mix.While Bogart is throwing away his promising career , his sister is going full speed on the Road to Skankville--having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash ! Bogey has no idea his sister ISN 'T the actress she claims to be and doesn 't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is .... Bogart 's SISTER ! ! ! All this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable . However , what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time ! By now , the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey 's sister ( whew ! ) but because she 's now poor and no good for Bogart , she 's about to fly away and kill herself . Bogey finds out , chases the plane on foot , jumps on the plane as it 's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her ! ! ! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous , I found myself laughing out loud . Up until then , I might have scored it a 4 or 5--this sunk the movie to a 3 ( how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me ) .The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film . On top of that , it 's all wrong for Bogart , as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s . Manly and solid better suits the man--one of America 's great actors but clearly out of his element here.By the way , those who love Pre-Code films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one . Practically everyone in the film believes in and practices pre-marital sex and Bogey curses in the film--things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The Texas Revolution of 1835 to 1836 , including the periods preceding and immediately following , is depicted in this mediocre 3-hour made-for-television film , whose only redeeming value is bringing light and paying homage to Stephen F. Austin , the so-called " " Father of Texas " " whose life story had long been overshadowed by that of the legendary Sam Houston . The rest of the film is simply the usual " " Santa Anna is a tyrant " " storyline and with a weak attempt to show the Mexican perspective with a fictional Hispanic character displaying stereotypical Latin machismo . Combined with short low-budget battle scenes , such as the Alamao and San Jacinto , this film is recommended only for real history buffs who who do not come from Mexico . To its credit , the Mexican uniforms look accurate and the romantic subplot ( another love triangle ) doesn 't take up too much screen time . Overall , this movie depicts the violent secession movement by Texas ' Anglo-Saxon racial minority to be a positive and just revolution against Mexican tyranny as personified by the general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna , the so-called " " Napoleon of the West " .

" This film is so incredibly bad , that I almost felt sick watching it . Up until this point , the other installments had at least one good thing about it . Part 1 was suspenseful and gory . Part 2 was off beat and entertaining . Part 3 was interesting with great effects . Part 4 had great music , good special effects , and a new entertaining Freddy Krueger . Part 5 is more boring than anything I 've ever seen before . Alice , a much prettier blond , from Part 4 is back with her boyfriend Dan . At parts , this supposed Elm Street installment turns into a daytime soap . The newer characters seem harsh , and even that sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder . Freddy seems to be completely out of this one . He looks tired , and doesn 't seem to be as gruesome . His one-liners seem out of place and different , where as in Part 4 they could be pretty funny . Leslie Bohem 's story never gets off the ground and Stephen Hopkins ' direction is so bad , that it makes my grandmother look good ! The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic . It 's also confusing and pretty stupid . Avoid Part 5 at all costs ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This stuffy melodrama is quite easily the worst film starring Ingrid Bergman that I 've seen . Even her luminous screen presence can 't save this insufferably slow and meandering movie that 's nearly impossible to sit through without fast-forwarding a lot of it.Only for die-hard Bergman fans ; others are very likely to fall asleep . I suggest you to watch " " For Whom the Bell Tolls " " instead . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to Italy , tired of the Hollywood glamor treatment . First it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI , an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress . And now it 's EUROPA 51 , another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment.Nor does the story do much for Alexander KNOX , in another thankless role as her long-suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son . At least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than STROMBOLI.Bergman is still attractive here , but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman . She 's never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son , despite attempts by a kindly male friend . " " Sometimes I think I 'm going out of my mind , " " she tells her husband . A portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace , but it does give us a sense of where the story is going.Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome , but being a social worker with poor children doesn 't improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse.The film 's overall effect is that it 's not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like Bergman . The film loses pace midway through the story as Bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she 's two-timing him . The story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street-walker through her terminal illness . The final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum.Ingrid suffers nobly through it all ( over-compensating for the loss of her son ) but it 's no use . Not one of her best flicks , to put it mildly.Trivia note : If she wanted neo-realism with mental illness , she might have been better off accepting the lead in THE SNAKE PIT when it was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak ! ! It would have done more for her career than EUROPA 51.Summing up : Another bleak indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Like the beauty of the jungle , Jessica Alba 's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film , but alas they are the only two things worth watching this film for . When in theory we should be watching for the narrative.The plot is thin on the ground , and hard to believe . As beautiful as Jessica Alba is , she doesn 't add any of the spark that she injected into the credible ' Dark Angel ' series . Since Dark Angel it seems that Alba has been reduced to mere eye candy ( but what eye candy ! ) , and is the sole reason for putting her into films.The concept of the sleeping dictionary is daft and implausible , with little character development ( or character for that matter ) to make us want to undertake the 109 minutes run time with this world . Despite the films short running time , it still manages to feel to long and too laboured.It seems a shame that such talent such as Brenda Blethyn , Emily Mortimer , Bob Hoskins are wasted on a threadbare narrative which barely raises a pulse . This film seriously misses a trick , an exotic setting , a more than capable cast , with lovely cinematography , and a chance to utilise the themes and the dualistic concepts of ' civilisation ' . But there is little narrative to speak of , no drama , no sense we are watching a story of love , more a story of lust and woman happy to please men without question . Lets be honest , if Jessica Alba was freely allowing you to sleep with her , do you seriously think you 'd be able to concentrate on learning a tribal language ? Therein lies the great problem , both in suspension of disbelief , and also what the female characters are limited and reduced to . Take for example the fact that Jessica alba 's character undergoes the mental and physical tribulation of pregnancy and birth to her forbidden love , yet all we see is her looking lovely and curvy one minute , then lovely and curvy , with a baby , the next.It 's a sorry state of affairs to see a film with promise not live up to anything near it 's potential . I could write endlessly of the films flaws , but it pains me to do so . The film looks good , the premise could have been made into a lovely film , but sadly it wasn 't to be . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If this documentary had not been made by the famous French director , Louis Malle , I probably would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes , as it was an incredibly dull look at a very ordinary Midwestern American town in 1979 . This is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies . Considering I didn 't know any of these people , it was even less interesting.Because it was a rather dull slice of life style documentary , I wondered while watching what was the message they were trying to convey ? Perhaps it was that values aren 't as conservative as you might think--this was an underlying message through many of the vignettes ( such as the Republicans whose son was a draft resister as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine ) . Or , perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of bigotry underlying the nice home town--as several ugly ideas such as blaming Jews for financial conspiracies , anti-Black bigotry and homophobia all were briefly explored.The small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed , but when the film makers returned six years later , the mood was depressed thanks to President Reagan . This seemed very disingenuous for several reasons . First , the 1979 portion was almost 90 % of the film and the final 10 % only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne . What about the rest of the folks of this town ? Did they all see Reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative ? With only a few updates , it seemed suspicious . Second , while it is true that the national debt doubled in the intervening years , so did the gross national product . And , while Malle shows 1979 as a very optimistic period , it was far from that , as the period from 1974-1980 featured many shortages ( gas , sugar , etc . ) , strikes , high inflation and general malaise . While I am not a huge fan of Reagan because government growth did NOT slow during his administration , the country , in general , was far more optimistic than it had been in the Ford and Carter years . While many in the media demonized Reagan ( a popular sport in the 80s ) , the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one-sided and agenda driven . Had the documentary given a more thorough coverage of 1985 and hadn 't seemed too negative to be believed ( after all , everyone didn 't have their lives get worse--this defies common sense ) , then I might have thought otherwise.Overall , not the wonderful documentary some have proclaimed it to be--ranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely slanted look at 1985.By the way , is it just me , or does the film DROP DEAD GORGEOUS seem to have been inspired , at least in part , by this film ?

The title is confusingly similar to Hell Hole ( 1978 ) aka " " Escape from Women 's Hell Hole " " A group of women bathe in a river and seemingly the worst thing they have to worry about is a peeping tom , who they easily overpower . No nudity in this or any other scene , however.A woman named Cardena drives up in a car and seems to be known and liked by all the women . She invites Indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle M.G. Once they get there , it becomes clear that M.G. wants to take Indri 's virginity . M.G. runs some sort of house of prostitution , and he 's either in charge of a corrupt branch of the military , or runs a paramilitary outfit , or prefers for his guards to all wear military-style uniforms.The women who refuse him or otherwise make trouble get put into a prison . Indri gets sent there . The women get tortured and sometimes possibly raped by the guards.Various unsuccessful attempts at escape or rescue are made , but inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages the women have : they outnumber the guards vastly , and relatively few of the guards have automatic weapons - most have semi-automatic rifles or handguns.WIP genre enthusiasts may like it , and the fact that it was made in the Philippines gives it some novelty , but otherwise ... eh . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago , and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day . It 's not that bad for a made-for-TV horror movie , but it is derivative ( mostly of The Exorcist ) and businesslike , for lack of a better word . It won 't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting , but it 's not a waste of time , either . It 's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren 't in the mood to think too hard.However , if you go into the movie looking for some laughs , you won 't be disappointed . The early scenes , with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening , and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog ( with horns ! ) are pretty side-splitting . And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning.Not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination , but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What a sad sight these TV stalwarts make , running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate . The whole production feels cheap and shabby , and it 's not helped by a " " big name " " star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he 's given in a credible fashion.At no time do the supporting cast rise above the material ; they 're clearly watching the clock here . Bang out the scenes , get the pay cheque , go home , and try to forget all about it.It 's not particularly badly scripted or filmed ; there are no real clangers , it 's just utterly anodyne , and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras . The pacing is a little bizarre ; an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub-plot is only begun after the main action starts , which makes it feel irrelevant.Maiden Voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored , and for being a fun game of " " spot the Kiwi bit parters " " ; most of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena : Warrior Princess . The saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Critters 3 starts on the open road as Clifford ( John Calvin ) his teenage daughter Annie ( Aimee Brooks ) & his young son Johnny ( the IMDb list two actor 's Christian & Josephh Cousins , identical twins perhaps ? ) are heading back home from a vacation . Suddenly the tyre on their van blows & they have to stop at a public rest area to fix it . While there Annie & Johnny meet a kid named Josh ( Leonardo DiCaprio , yes that one ) who in turn all run into Charlie McFadden ( the films co-producer Don Keith Opper ) from the previous two Critter films . Charlie tells them the story of the Critters & the town of Grovers Bend but they don 't believe him . Meanwhile back at the van a Critter lays some eggs on it 's underside , out of sight from everyone . Once Clifford has fixed the tyre the trio set off for their home , a run down urban tenement block in Los Angeles somewhere complete with Critter eggs along for the ride . Upon arrival the eggs hatch & the Critters head straight inside the tenement block quickly disposing of Frank ( Geoffrey Blake ) , the caretaker . As the night draws on the few remaining residents , a fat woman named Rosalie ( Diana Bellamy ) , a telephone repair woman Marsha ( Katherine Cortez ) , an elderly couple Mr. ( Bill Zuckert ) & Mrs. Menges ( Frances Bay ) must come together with Clifford & his kids to fight the Critters . Josh also makes an appearance as his Stepfather ( William Dennis Hunt ) owns the building . But will the group be able to defeat the Critters & prevent themselves from becoming dinner ? Directed Kristine Peterson I thought Critters 3 was an incredibly undistinguished film , but at least she can say she made a film staring Leonardo DiCaprio & not many people can say that ! The budget for Critters 3 probably wasn 't exactly a fortune as the whole production looks cheap throughout , there are very few characters , very few Critters & I think only 3 ever appear in the same shot at once & it does away with any sort of space angle so there are no expensive spaceship or distant alien planet special effects to pay for . The script by David J. Schow is strictly by-the-numbers & very predictable . A group of humans are stuck in an isolated situation with Critters & have no means of contacting the outside world for help , that plot scenario sounds very familiar right ? Well it 's same as the previous Critters ( 1986 ) & Critters 2 : The Main Course ( 1988 ) & many other horror films so it should . Critters 3 does nothing with the premise , it never even tries to add anything to an already old , tired & well used storyline . Critters 3 is also very tame for a horror film with only two people actually being killed , the comedy elements are seriously lacking as well with the best joke Critters 3 can mange being a Critter eating some beans & then farting , very funny if your about 5 years old . The characters are mostly standard horror film clich챕s & quickly became annoying . There is virtually no blood or gore in Critters 3 at all , just a few splashes of blood & disappointingly Critters 3 in fact seems to go out of it 's way not to show any violence . The special effects on the Critters are OK but they still look like static , simplistic hand-puppets that have very little movement . The acting isn 't that good & Critters 3 happens to be a certain Leonardo DiCaprio 's very first feature film , to be fair to the kid he 's alright & I wonder if any of the other cast or crew had an idea what he go on to become . Why on Earth does that Charlie guy have to keep popping up in these Critter films ? To give Critters 3 some credit it moves along at a good pace & isn 't boring , it 's generally well made with nice enough production values & it 's a bit of harmless fun if your in the right sort of mood & thankfully it only lasts for about 80 odd minutes . Overall Critters 3 is an OK time waster but don 't expect anything deep or meaningful . There 's nothing really wrong with it as cheap horror film but I couldn 't help feeling that I 'd seen it all before . An average time-waster that isn 't as good as either of the previous two Critter films . Critters 3 ends with a ' to be continued ... ' as this was filmed back to back with Critters 4 ( 1991 ) which unsurprisingly went straight to video , probably to save even more money . Critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch it on T.V. for free otherwise don 't bother . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on " " Mystery Science Theater " " have received a tons of low ratings on IMDb . However , a few of the films featured on the films weren 't that bad and it 's not fair to rate a film that 's been given the " " MST " " treatment--with the hosts making funny comments during the film . Now I am NOT saying that " " The Girl in Lover 's Lane " " is a great film , but it 's not nearly bad enough to merit its current IMDb score of 2.1.The film begins with Bix and Danny meeting . Bix is a veteran drifter and Danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering about the country . Once they blow into a small town , Bix needs to rescue Danny again and again because Danny is quite naive--a nice way of saying he has the intellect of a tomato.Along the way , something happens to the self-assured Bix--he finds a nice young lady and finds the lure of staying put pulling at him . And , in an odd subplot , Jack Elam plays a super-creepy sicko who wanders the town scaring the crap out of everyone--yet oddly , the police don 't seem to take much notice nor does anyone on their own do anything about him . Ultimately , however , when Elam puts the moves on a girl who Bix is falling for , things come to a full boil.Overall , while not at all a great film , there were many interesting plot elements in this film--enough to merit a score higher than 2.1 . The biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as the total stupidity of Danny one time too often . Considering the minuscule budget , however , it 's a watchable little film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I had high hopes for this film when I saw the listing and decided to watch it on TV , uninterrupted by commercial breaks . I 've liked Lee Van Cleef in many movies but I 'm afraid that having the other characters call him Chris repeatedly doesn 't turn him into even a reasonable facsimile of Yul Brenner 's Chris.I found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the music sound track tried to impart the magnificence portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original . The rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film . I guess if you haven 't seen the original it would be okay . Too many clich챕s and too little depth to the characters . I missed the humanity and compassion and the three dimensional characters of the original . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was excited when I heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie . The whole era ( 1980 's Southern California ) and subject matter ( drug and porn industry ) is intriguing to me . I thought this would be a sure fire hit . I was not thrilled with the choice of Kilmer as Holmes , they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms . I guess he sells tickets ? However , I was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot . I was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing . Now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do , I will admit that . There were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act . John Holmes was there , but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family ( and self ) if he talked to police about it . In fact , Holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved . So this was still really one big mystery , a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on . The person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead . However , there is no real storyline , it is fragmented claptrap . The script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting . The film gives no insight into Holmes or the other people involved . Kilmer 's character disappears for long stretches , his girlfriend is dull , the police are jokes . Even Kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial . It is a very shallow piece and dare I say , boring . The director even tries to turn it into a love story . Which is nice , unless you know anything about what a piece of trash John Holmes really was . Perhaps a couple of viewings of Anderson 's " " Boogie Nights " " might have helped here . " " Boogie Nights " " was innovative and exciting in all regards . This film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style . Even the music is out of place , with Duran Duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in 1980 . Then we have Gordon Lightfoot ? Gordon Lightfoot ? There could have been a great film based on this gruesome event , but I have not seen it yet . I have not seen even a decent one yet ( unless you consider the Rahad Jackson scene from Boogie Nights ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" As the faux-Russian scientist says two-thirds of the way into the movie , " " I came for the science . " " This pretty much sums up the reason I watched this movie - anything that involves a half-man , half-hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation on the part of an impartial aspiring scientist . Or , as they say in the biz , my girlfriend 's brother had the remote and the rest is history . To say that the special effects were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effects . This is 2005 , it is not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background . Yeah , this was charming and state of the art when Hitchcock was filming " " The Birds " " but in 2005 it just looks low budget . Spare me the cheap attempt at Sci-Fi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief.However , having seriously defamed the overall concept of this film , let me tell you again that , as sad as it may sound , this is probably worth your time . If nothing else , it is a tour de force of bad Sci-Fi - worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in their day.The crazy hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to spoon canfuls of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind , but also the ability of " " B " " movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines.This film also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contentions - bad guys always wear sunglasses.If this weren 't 2005 , I would be deadset on the fact this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the Cold War . I mean , you might as well have Khan on the bridge of a Klingon Bird of Prey inserting leaches into Chekhov 's ear.One of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists that the Charlton Heston lookalike , " " wait for Tom " " as he is trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground . The thing is , Tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys with his never-ending banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov , or AK-47 , in layman 's terms.As the mad scientist says near the end of the film , " " my goal is to evolve the human species " " - suffice it to say that this movie contributed only to a devolution of humankind . The faint Freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepping the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This time The Beastmaster ( Marc Singer ) returns only to face off a new enemy Arklon ( Wings Hauser ) however due to an annoying teenager ( Kari Wuher ) they are transported to the future where they then duke it out . Lots of ( lame ) fish out of water jokes ensue . You honestly don 't get sequels this rotten to the core . Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie to behold . The references and " " hipness " " date the film badly ( This was made in 1991 ) and really who wants to see The Beastmaster in the present times ? Also of note is Wings Hauser who 's embarrassing performance is easily the film 's best asset . Singer looks awkward , Wuher is irritating and the whole 1991 slang just makes the movie downright unwatchable . This is easily one of the worst movies ever made.1 / 2 * out of 4- ( Awful ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Cedric Kahn 's films have been character-based , rather than action-based ( I 'm thinking of L 'Ennui and Feux rouges ) so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to Succo . I don 't find Stefano Cassetti to be an interesting actor ; he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies , like Bret Favre . That blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights . A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on Succo 's personality , rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.The little acting there is comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by storm . The interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in . Le Besco apart , there is little to recommend this film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the most pitiful excuse for a comedy show I 've ever seen . I 'm confounded that this guy was given his own show . It smells of complete and utter desperation on the part of comedy central , trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable Dave Chapelle . He 's a tip from Ned 's bag of comedy gold : Is a punchline not funny ? Need to give it that extra push into hilarity ? F * * * ING YELL IT AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS . Simple , no ? And as an added bonus .... finish half your jokes with ... THEN YOU 'RE RE-TAH-DED ! ! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHH ! Oh man . So .... funny . Beaner ... hilarious . Wetback .... does the laughter ever stop ? To illustrate my point in a more cerebral way , i 'll cite an example . Mencia jokes about how " " retarded " " it is to rebuild new orleans , because it 's so close to the water . Genius . The line of distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been drawn so clearly . While a good comedian would find hidden humor in the tragedy , finding subtle ways of weaving a joke into something that we can all laugh at and take solace in , Ned goes for the obvious . Move the city . Great . Wait , is that funny ? Ned doesn 't have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things . The hurricane didn 't flood the city , ned . The levee project was underfunded and in serious need of federal dollars ... and behold ! They broke . I guess that 's God 's way of telling us we shouldn 't be there . After all , he 's got a seat in congress . What a fool.Chapelle was a master of turning a tired racial comedic spin on its head . He was effortless at it , and at all points , we were laughing with him . While mencia talks about black people not being able to swim * yawn , * Chapelle took it 300 yards further with the black and blind white supremesist . You don 't have to be scathing to be edgy . You have to be original . Mencia and his legions of fans are like that closeted gay dude who laughs all too emphatically at gay jokes , thinking it somehow masks his own insecurities .

" I 'll be honest-- the pimped out purple plane with Snoop Dogg at the helm is an amusing visual gag . It would have been a decent concept for a 30 second commercial , or maybe a 3 minute music video . But the producers have committed the age-old concept comedy sin of stretching 30 seconds of material into an hour and a half of film , and the results are predictably lame . The remainder of the 89 minutes are filled with the typical gamut of racist and sexist humor and fart jokes , offensive and-- worst of all-- painfully unfunny . The threadbare plot screams under the weight of its contrivances . Best to be avoided unless you are drunk or stoned . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There is just one word for this film . Appalling . The director clearly has talent but like his character Robert Carmichael he throws it all away.Carmichael has potential , but like Cray he can 't be bothered to use it . Being drawn into petty crime and then descending into depravity is Cray 's vision of British youth . Like the British tabloids this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect . Cray cries out for attention , but deserves none.I was appalled by the act of violence that Cray chose to shove in the faces of the audience . He assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities . Like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall he shows us male depravity with adolescent glee.Some actors of quality have small parts in this film . Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both make short appearances . The acting is otherwise amateur , the young men Joe and Ben are cringe making . Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is creepy . Miranda Wilson plays Monica , the attractive wife of celeb chef Jonathon ( Michael Howe ) ; how she was able to subject herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief . The film is never subtle and Monica is treated to the most gratuitous violence which is cut with war action . War imagery is used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves , that acts of violence will occur within even " " civilised " " countries . This is most certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society where males have an increasingly less important position , but Cray descends to the level of the barbaric males he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images . The female characters in the film offer no relief . They are either victims or in Manville 's case a washed out mother . The community is represented as dysfunctional.This is Cray 's first film . I listened to what he had to say during a Q and A session at Edinburugh and he is not unintelligent , he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety . The film is due to be released later this year , but I hope the company goes bust cos the public really don 't need this kind of messed up material . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Oh my , I think this may be the single cheesiest movie I 've ever seen . I 'm serious , this is one of the ultimate b-movies . The first proof is that it isn 't a $ 5 DVD . Oh no , that 's too mainstream for this . I got this on VHS , from a bin full of ex-rental videos at my local video store.If I may quote the blurb : " " In 17th Century Japan , there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages . His name was Mayeda . He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain . Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives . Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved Japan . " " It then goes on to say " " A multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents " " I must have seen a different movie . This was no epic , and it certainly wasn 't a multi million dollar anything . No , ' Shogun Mayeda ' is really just the crazy adventures of the Engrish-speaking Mayeda ( Sho Kosugi ) . He isn 't even a Shogun really , but thats not important . What is important , is that he does a really cool impression of John Cleese 's repeated charging of the one castle in ' Monty Python and the Holy Grail ' , and his ability to go from serious scenes to showing off his samurai mind powers . Awesome.The greatest thing about this movie is Sho Kosugi 's Engrish accent . The movie may lack nearly everything that makes a good movie , but makes up for it with some of the cheesiest lines ever , delivered by the coolest Engrish accent ever . And honestly , do you really want anything else ? You could fast forward ' Shogun Mayeda ' to the end , and replay Kosugi 's final line over and over . The tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that one line . Awesome.2 / 10 - So very very cheesy . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares . For a horror or " " thriller " " film and hype , it 's way too tame . There are only a few tense moments in here , not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre . Even those " " tense " " scenes weren 't much . The music made them more dramatic that they actually were.There is a lot of symbolism in here , so the elitist critics label this " " a thinking person 's horror film .

" Once again , I fell for it , in my roots I crave a fun and gory horror film , even a vampire one . Even if it 's stupid , as long as I get my fun gore in the mix , I 'm a happy camper , it doesn 't take much . So I saw the cover of " " Bled " " over at Hollywood Video and was kind of curious what it was about , it looked kind of interesting , so I decided to rent it . Why ? Why do I always fall for it ? Not only did this movie not fulfill the satisfaction I needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity , but I was bored out of mind . This movie has the kahoonies to say it 's a vampire movie and it 's really not ! I 'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money back because this is one of the rare times I actually turned the movie off.An artist meets a vampire , I think , dunno , I 'm still trying to figure out what the heck he was but his name was Reinfield , so I 'm assuming maybe he 's a cockroach eating guy who likes to freak people out ? I think , I dunno . Anyways , he thinks the artist has a certain flare for darkness , so he gives her a drug to go into an alternate fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive ? I think , I dunno . So her friends get excited and decide they wanna try the drug too , I think , I dunno . So after they decide to try the drug , things get weird , the fantasies are real , I think , I dunno , and the vampire is now enjoying the will big breasted girls in scandly clad clothing . I think , I dunno . But a couple of the girls really end up being vampires ? I think , I dunno.Sorry for all the " " I dunno 's " , " this is possibly one of the worst reviews I 'm going to write , but that 's because this movie was just awful , boring , and confusing . I love just seeing these wanna be actors who you can tell are waiters looking for that " " big break " . " Not too smart that they fell in the clich챕 of the horror genre , sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn 't , in this case , they really should have read the script . Because the movie , the look , the feel , the acting , everything about this movie was just bad , I really recommend that you just pass the movie if you see it at your video store . This possibly could have been an interesting movie with it 's concept of a different dimension , but why did they pick this director to display his " " creativity " " if he even has any ? This was a bad movie , just stay away.1 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I wasn 't as " " lucky " " as some of the others commenting on this film : i have never seen anything else out of the ... shall we say ... " " fecund " " mind of Sarno . I agree with many : some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and ( go-go ) dancing are not really that attractive . I kinda liked Fraulein Crank ( ? ) ... she was so homely , she was cute ! The acting was pretty stale , also , though delivering lines in a second language might have accounted for a lot of that problem . Trying to follow the plot was a major chore : was there one , really ? I do heartily agree with one other comment : for a vampire movie , there 's not much blood . Yep , if you want GOOD bloodsucking flicks , check out such Hammer classics as " " Horror of Dracula " " and ( my personal favourite ) " " Brides of Dracula " . " The most ( unintentionally ) humorous part is where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of bats ... which you never SEE ! ... the bats , I mean.Okay as a time-waster if you happen to catch it on cable here in the Great White North but , for heaven 's sake , don 't rent it ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Although I 'm not too much of a religious person , I still had relatively high hopes for this movie , as it does have the amazing Steve Carrell , and its prequel , Bruce Almighty , was actually a creative and clever Christian-themed comedy . However , Evan Almighty comes nowhere near this originality and freshness that the original has , and can 't decide whether it 's a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values . If it had chosen one clear path of which of these themes to focus on , it could have lived up to its potential , but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor , cheesy dialogue and motifs that attempt to give the movie profundity , but instead practically insults the intelligence of the audience , and also a very confused and clouded presentation of the movie 's opaque message . It was very obvious that Evan Almighty was very poorly written , there are numerous plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense . For example , although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the planet swarm to Evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood , is their inclusion really necessary when the only " " flood " " that happens in the movie is downtown Washington D.C. and a suburban neighborhood , meaning they are at no risk of being wiped out ? The filmmakers it seems lacked the originality to modernize the Bible story whatsoever , and instead just had it take place in a present time without changing anything to the plot , leaving many elements that just don 't add up such as this and make it obvious of the idiotic motifs and writing within the movie . Overall , this work is tragic in that the acting talent of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes isn 't exhibited because of the bland characters they portray , and that it was so poorly written that it skews and clouts many of the film 's attempted themes , and makes a mockery of the first film . Finally , Evan Almighty also is an insult to the brilliant actors in it and any halfway-intelligent moviegoer , in that it fails both of them miserably . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I viewed this movie in DVD format . My copy may have been affected but I was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the DVD . I will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was Claire Forlani . While fun to watch , I feel she didn 't live up to my expectations that I have so far found from her other films . I actually was equally pleased to see Arkin turn in a humorous performance . The other two actors I wasn 't very familiar with so I can 't compare their performance , however they were fairly enjoyable also . The acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion . The story line , while some could say slightly compelling , lacked direction .

" This movie defines the word " " confused " . " All the actors stay true to the script . More 's the pity , because the acting is fine , but the script is a confused pastiche of pseudo-psycho-analytic random ideas . The pacing is mind-numbingly slow , and the soft-focus-lens cinematography gets on the nerves quickly . I give it 4 out of 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is bizarre . Better put , it 's " " freakin ' weird " . " I could give you a plot summary , or some hoity toity analysis , but I would consider it a waste of your time . All anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters , one incestuous relationship , homicide , post mortem mutilation , and one really disturbing infatuation . At the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself , but not in a good way like after " " Pulp Fiction " " or " " Fight Club " . " It 's like you 're a teenager ( or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenager ) and have just done something you A : wish you hadn 't done , and B : hope to the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never find out about . And nobody likes that . My advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth , just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch " " Kazaam " " ( yes , I would rather watch " " Kazaam " " than " " Murderous Maids " , " read into it what you want ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was a movie i could not wait to see ! So i finally got it and I was pretty disappointed . For starters , the movie has so little said about New York , just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings , streets , bridges and cafes.It really doesn 't stay focused on the New York magic.Another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie.I know that it is a remake , but it is not a french style remake ! Anyway , here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies , such as long and messy scenes , no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style ! The story follows many lives ( too many for my taste ) and they somehow seem connected in the end . I feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories . The movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone 's happy ending.So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each.And there you have your 120 minutes ! if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you ! i give it 4 just because i love New York and i loved the cast ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I must say , I found this movie very disappointing . Yes , I know Maltin gave it 3 1 / 2 and others think very highly of it . But , well , the opera sequences were god-awful . I take it Jeannete MacDonald is an acquired taste . Yes , in the short sequences I have seen her with Nelson Eddy , she is immensely preferable to him . But on her own ... God , I dislike opera and despise operetta , and she is basically intolerable . At one point I had to cover my ears . Gable is just OK , and Tracy is thrown away . The plot is annoying in the JM never simply tells Gable she loves him and the opera and why can 't she do both ? Instead she suffers silently ( or not so ) with the compromises she makes . The supporting cast is distinctly unmemorable . Besides the star three and Jack Holt ( and I suppose his mother ) , they all are just background and forgettable . The EQ sequence is the only thing that saves the movie . And just . Yes , it is fairly spectacular and moving . But the " " oh God is great " " seems very contrived . I immensely prefer " " In Old Chicago " " as far as old time disaster spectaculars go . Spare yourself on this one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This HBO original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb . Armand Assante , once again doing a poor Stallone imitation , is Ray Wellman a ex-con just out on parole . All he wants is his old girlfriend Lacy , played by a young Marcia Gay Harden , back . Unfortunately for Ray , Lacy has hooked up with stalwart Elliot , played by Sam Neill . Further complicating matters is that Ray 's old Cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap Lacy to make sure they happen . Ray and Elliot team up , despite mutual dislike.What follows is violent and slow , but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why she would win Oscar in the future , she 's not as polished here , but her raw emotion , sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching . Almost.Rent " " Fever " " ( no the title doesn 't fit the film ) if your a fan of hers , otherwise skip it and be grateful it 's stars went on to better things.Note-this is a hard " " R " " flick for language , violence and nudity . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" What do you get when you mix a lump of clich챕s with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you don 't care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clich챕s and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget ? Why , you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movies ever made ! I 'm referring , of course , to Domino.Here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this movie : " " Ooh , wow , the storyline is told out of sequence , that hasn 't been done a billion times before . And much more skillfully than in this movie . " " " " Wow , look at all of the flashing lights and grainy film texture and elaborate transitions ! The director is trying so hard to make things look arty and to establish a visual style ! It 's just too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes they 're in , and it 's also too bad that most of them come across as irritating ! " " " " I 've heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before ! " " " " I 've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before ! " " " " This one too ! " " " " Uh , didn 't they reveal this ' plot twist ' about half an hour ago ? Was that supposed to be surprising ?

" " And , finally : " " I might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me . " " In summation , this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect . Avoid watching it at all costs . If your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that isn 't flammable , you should seriously consider being burned alive instead .

" This rather formulaic swords and flying fists movie is a decent early display of John Woo 's talents . The cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable .

" I managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of MST3K , and oh boy , even with the riffing this movie was excruciatingly bad . Imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be out done by a monkey.The highlights ( what little there were ) came from the special effects , which were " " OK " . " The acting for the most part was also " " OK " " ; though nothing special , it was of a higher quality than other B-Movies I have seen in the past.The rest of this movie is dismally bad , The camera work often looks like they 've just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along . The story ( if it can be called that ) is so full of holes it 's almost funny , It never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place , or needs human flesh in order to survive . The script is poorly written and the dialogue verges on just plane stupid . The climax to movie ( if there is one ) is absolutely laughable.If you can 't find the MST3K version , avoid this at all costs . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Let me say this about Edward D. Wood Jr . He had a passion for his work that I wish more people did have . If we all had the optimism and the commanding hope of Ed Wood , the world would probably be a much better place . Being familiar with Ed Wood 's story and having seen the most wonderful biopic " " Ed Wood " " ( 1994 ) several times , I admire his boldness and his strives for the job he loved ; I still admire his never-say-die attitude . He had a love for directing that I wish more people in modern-day Hollywood had.But that doesn 't make his movies any more fun to watch . And " " Glen or Glenda , " " his first and most confessional film , is probably his very worst . " " Glen or Glenda " " is a deadening cult movie about a cross-dresser named Glen ( played by director / writer Ed Wood himself ) who despite his love for his fianc챕e Barbara ( Dolores Fuller ) , cannot seem to conquer his lust for transvestitism , in which he dresses in women 's clothing and a wig and thus becomes ... Glenda ! Glen / Glenda 's story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called " " The Scientist " " played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi . Oh , and there 's also some sub-story about an Alan / Anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the Christine Jorgenson story , upon whom this movie originally titled " " I Changed My Sex ! " " was previously to be based.Have I dropped your jaw yet ? Well , as much as I want to warn you off this picture if you 've never seen it , I would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of falsehood in that plot synopsis I just gave you . Every thing in it is true . This is a movie about cross-dressers and transsexuals , a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner . I 'm sure that with a good screenplay , and a good director ( it had neither ) that " " Glen or Glenda , " " despite the subject matter , could have been a very moving picture . It is a confessional movie on Wood 's part , as he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen . But once again , that does not make it a good movie ... or a watchable one for that matter . " " Glen or Glenda " " is a jumbled , disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema . It makes no more sense than does its notoriously silly scene where Bela Lugosi screams " " Pull the string ! " " over inexplicable footage of stampeding bison . The majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice , reminding me of some very bad short informative films I 've seen before . It 's like one of those really bad short films expanded into a seventy-minute feature and twice as dull . We sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes . There is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many grueling minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens . The only moments that are worth anybody 's time are those of Bela Lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches . I guess Lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the film , but personally , I couldn 't care less who or what he 's supposed to be . I 'll tell you what he was : A gifted actor who wound up making trash . But he and Wood were very good friends and liked working with each other , so good for him.I will always admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for the cinema , but I will never as long as I live admire his movies . A film critic once called Ed Wood 's movies " " innocent fun " " but I think even that is questionable . Innocent ? Yes . Fun ? No , sir . And if " " Citizen Kane " " is the Mount Everest of the cinematic world , then " " Glen or Glenda " " is probably the Mariana Trench . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time ; Meet Me in St Louis , The Bad and the Beautiful . I awaited this movie with great interest . But what a disappointment . Some Came Running is scene after scene of go-nowhere fatalism . Sinatra is a sad sack , returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships , a disappointing floozy hanging on him , living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project . The movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens . The sequence is intended to be tension-filled but Minelli is no Hitchcock ; he gets so distracted by pretty colors , he doesn 't notice the scene is a wheezing clich챕 and the characters are so thinly-drawn and poorly developed we don 't particularly care that they get shot . ( especially MacClane ) But that 's the only real cinematography in the project . Otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars & living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours . Hell IS other people , apparently.There is nothing going on in this movie . The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after WW2 is handled more deftly in ' The Best Years of Our Lives . ' And either of two Inge products , ' Splendor in the Grass ' and ' Picnic ' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end town , with much more poignance . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I found this an awfully disappointing experience ! But I have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry.This " " Felicia 's Journey " " is intriguing . It has drama . But it is full of stereo-types ! So it ONLY serves judgemental temperaments without concern for truer justice & fairness & truth , beyond black ' n ' white judgements that fit 30-second ads of " " NEWS " " that dot our multimedia experiences everyday , especially news bulletins , true or misleading in such depictions ! It is SO EXAGGERATED , it reminds me of the fairytale of " " Little Red Ridinghood " " ! Consider the innocent young girl with no identification crossing borders questioned by a guard but freed without any evidence to venture on in search of her ' Romeo ' who didn 't give her an address VERSUS the pathetically inept lack of substance in the raspy voice of the ' helping hand ' befriending her with his unlikely story fabricated by the layer ! It seems to suit the directors & management team that no-one has faith or prays to God , even in their times of desperation ! So in these early settings , it orchestrates & tells much of what is to come ! A nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairytale resolution , without truth or integrity or credibility ! ... Then one twist & it 's all over . What a disappointment ! If you want to see a MUCH superior movie that investigates similar themes with MUCH more credibility , with much more powerful insight , watch the 1983 Paul Cox / Norman Kaye " " Man of Flowers " " movie ! ! ! Unlike here , you will NOT be disappointed ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof : it reminds you just how bad bad can be . We often see films which we describe as " " pretty awful " " or " " not much good " , " but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren 't " " good " " they are no way as stinkingly bad as Bulletproof . This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru ' the DVD bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation ( i.e. to give me a present ) . It could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn 't : this is so utterly clich챕d , so badly written , so poorly directed , so badly acted that I 'm surprised everyone involved hasn 't been arrested and sent down for 10 years . God , it 's awful . I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in , but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable . This isn 't one of them .

" Yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award-material . But then it doesn 't try to be anything it is not . A fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners , a stellar and very funny performance by Peter O 'Toole , a grounding and down to earth performance from Joan Plowright . The band 's performance was on the spot , each one playing their role in a deft , comical manner . The music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely . From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads . A good example is the comment about the " " strange baseball-like game " , " well my dear American , that was cricket -from which baseball is derived- and the explaining of it to the ignorant US band was very funny for those that do know cricket . Also no , you were not supposed to wince when Carl broke a window ; it was funny how Lord Foxley said " " oh yes ! " " to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time " " oh no " " also referring to the money . Jeez , it seems that every joke must be explained to some people ...

" I have officially vomited in my own mouth , thanks to this movie.I expected the absolute worst with this movie , but I expected a heartwarming and pleasurable absolute worst . This is just terrible . Absolutely terrible . Terrible like Nazis spreading the black plague . Let me explain : Ewoks are speaking English . It 's horrible.The villain girl looks like she travelled from the future set of Power Rangers . I really really want her to rise up from the ground and say " " At last ! After ten thousand years I 'm free ! It 's time to conquer Earth ! " " The putties ... er , I mean the big bad whatever the heck they are ... they growl a lot . Many of them look like an even lamer version of the Cryptkeeper . The Cryptkeeper was pretty cool , but these guys were not.The only merit to this movie was Paul Gleason . This movie might have been better if he 'd went to the bad guys and said " " If I have to come in here again , I 'm crackin ' skulls .

" Republic pictures comes late in the game to the " " werewolf " " er Werecat genre .

The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents , something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a " " catman " .

Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn 't know if he 's the killer or not.Okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed . There are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections . The acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hatted killer , he 's the most interesting thing in this film. despite its short running time ( just over an hour ) I think the reason that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it .

" Where to start . The film started out pretty well , but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock . The horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in . It just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by.The actors gave an average performance in this movie however , i got a bit bored of Vinny Jones constant scowling in the film.As the film dragged on , and take my word for it , it dragged on , it just got more and more far fetched . * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * Just when i thought the film could not get any worse , towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up , just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all . It turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end . The ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was . Once the lead role disposes of Vinny Jones , he becomes the new killer.In closing , this film made Creep look like the best horror film ever made .

" This may not be the very worst movie Peter Sellers ever did ( I think that laurel goes to " " The Prisoner of Zenda " " ) but it is surely the most depressing . Sellers , especially sans makeup as Nayland Smith , looks like he has just undergone chemotherapy . As Fu Manchu , he looks hardly better and spends most of the film ( with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets jolted with electrical currents ) on the verge of collapsing under the weight of all that makeup . The supporting players also look tired and run down , and Sid Caeser 's presence is offensive even without his constant references to " " Chinks ! " " ( One bright spot : this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray Asians so insultingly ... or , for that matter , star a non-Asian as one ! ) . The film seems surprisingly cheap , with soupy photography and drab sets - even the whiz-bang Elvis number at the end looks cut-rate . Only the stunning Helen Mirren and the tall , thin , nervous guy who get his pants wet add any sparks of life to this sad affair . All in all , this film provides an eerie premonition of a great comic 's death , and an even eerier documentation of his dying . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It is one thing to have a slow pace where characters are being developed in a progressive way , or some aspect of the movie clearly is enhanced by such pacing ( such as ' Lost in Translation " " ) . However , there is a difference between slow progression and outright stalling , as happened in this one . I guess from the look on Helen Mirren 's face she must have been distraught by the disappearance of her husband ! ! Surprise , surprise ! !

" Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back ! This is a horror movie , not thriller , not suspense , a horror movie . Yes , this movie is a horror . Horrifyingly bad . After many years of lurking here at IMDb , I am actually moved to set up an account just so I ( like at least one other reviewer here ) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ! IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL , or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad , or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.Seriously , I 'd love to hear the director 's voice over on an " " enhanced " " DVD ( there 's another horrifying thought ) to see what the hell they were thinking . The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand , which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog . Not that it mattered much . Straining to hear the Russian , translate it in your head ( if you can ) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.I will give this movie a " " 1 " " because I cannot give it a lower rating , and because it did achieve one remarkable thing . It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic . Now that 's a dubious achievement.HERE 'S YOUR SPOILER : And the ending , holy mother ( no pun intended ) it 's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming . The " " climax " " of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film .

" BELL WITCH HAUNTING ( aka THE HAUNT ) is an American horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period 1817 to 1821.This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH : THE MOVIE , a movie starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events . However , I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw ! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer 's chilling performance in Friday THE 13TH . As such , I believe that even on a bad day , she 'd pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as THE HAUNT.With regard to my heading , this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing . It is painful to watch because it is just downright boring.Reading the positive reviews for this movie , I could only identify three possibilities . The first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way . The second possibility - the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed . The final possibility - none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise.The setting for the plot is Robertson County , Tennessee . James Johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the Bell Witch . The story is told as a series of flashbacks . A series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of John Bell and his family . It soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all.On the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair , albeit one based on real events.Where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however , just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong . And then some ! First , the acting . The acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board . This factor does the most damage to the production , undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer . The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent . I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines . Unfortunately , this voice began to become very annoying very quickly ! I may not have been alive in the 1800s , but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this " " ghost " " does ! Second , the direction . The direction is haphazard and very uneven . Some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director . Nothing is done with the camera , with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary . The atmosphere is equally flat . A vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences . Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them . I 'll give one example . In one scene , the spirit attacks someone . See the scene for yourself . It 's almost funny - almost.Third , the script . Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences , it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring . Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story . This movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story . Whilst this style was also the case with British movies from the British horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s , it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works . Peter Cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers . The same cannot be said of the actors in THE HAUNT.Finally , the humour . The ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating . An obese boy is the butt of many jokes . One particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet . This scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing ! The only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes . The decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity . The costumes were also well chosen.Overall , THE HAUNT is an appalling movie . It is not even in the " " so bad it 's good " " league . It is instead just boring . I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague . Don 't even bother seeing it for free ! I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch . But it really couldn 't be any worse than THE HAUNT . Could it ? I 'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down.In the meantime , I would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting . THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE , THE CHANGELING , RINGU , THE GRUDGE ( Japanese original ) and ONE MISSED CALL ( Japanese original ) are good places to start . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Bela Lugosi is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to Dracula . He is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a legend like Lugosi could save the badness of the idea of this movie and unlike most old unspenseful horror films this movie doesn 't set the mood very well . Even at its worst any of Bela 's movies is only mediocre though . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" From watching the trailer , the movie looked pretty interesting . The production of the movie is also pretty good--it looks like they had a good budget and doesn 't look like a cheaply made movie . The acting ranges from good ( Joe Morton as Professor Simon ) to OK ( Kelly Overton as Eve ) to bad ( James Haven as Don ) .The actual content and plot of the movie is weak . The movie starts out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed , disappointingly boring , twist . Watching the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie OK but everything in between makes this an absolutely boring movie to watch . It 's as though they made a short movie then tried to force it to be over an hour long by stuffing the middle with an hour of filler material.If you want to waste a good hour and half of your life , watch this movie . Otherwise , stay away from this extremely boring movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" He 's the only reason to see this film . He gives a very good performance--much better than this crap deserves . He 's very handsome and very talented--he deserves better than this .

So , if you 're fans of either of them you might want to watch . Otherwise , stay away . One more complaint--couldn 't we have had more scenes of Esai shirtless ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Tedious girls-at-reform-school flick , which plays somewhat like a prison movie . Chris ( Linda Blair ) is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father .

" Apparently Shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is . At one point in this film , someone ( I believe Pacino 's producer ) warns him that film is getting off track , that it was once about how the masses think about Shakespeare through the vehicle of RICHARD III . Instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout . Some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for Al ( was there really ANY reason for the quick visit to Shakespeare 's birthplace , other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there ? ) , and , before the film has really even begun , we are treated to seeing Al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera . I thought his silly act with Kay near the end of GODFATHER III with the knife to his throat was AN ACT - but apparently it 's how Al really behaves in person.Enough rambling . Here 's a shotgun smattering of why I didn 't even make it 3 / 4 of the way through this : 1 ) pretentious - Al always knows when the camera is on him , whether he 's acting as Richard or in a ' real ' conversation with someone - you can see it in the corner of his eyes , also , some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme . If anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside , it 's unbearable . " " Look at me , chewing all the scenery ! " " 2 ) Winona Ryder . When she appears as Lady Anne , this film comes to a screeching halt , which it never recovers from . She has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes . Her performance is dreadful , to boot . 3 ) the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture . Of course , you also learn that Pacino shouldn 't be directing films ( or doing Richard in the first place ) . I 'd rather watch BOBBY DEERFIELD than this.Lastly , read the play and learn it for yourself . Go out and see it performed . In 1997 I saw the play performed at the University of Washington Ethnic Cultural Theater , and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama ( except for the gratuitous throat slashing of Clarence ! My God ! Was that necessary ? ! ) It 's all just a bunch of sound and fury , signifying nada . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ( this may be a bit on the spoilerish side ) I would like to start by saying I did not watch the entire movie , nor could I because it was evident from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed . That of course is the problem with taking , what many believe to be an amazing book , and turning it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie.A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago . It 's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults . Plus it 's got built in quality sequels . But Disney-fying was not the way to go . The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book . It is a complicated and emotional story for kids . There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely " " psychic " , " because that was the easiest way of explaining it . There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W 's as added tension , there is enough tension in the story without that . There was no reason to remove Meg 's glasses ... that deprived us of what could 've been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book.I could nitpick for days about little things , but I also think larger things , like the art direction was a off . Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look , with its strangely darkened skies . The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth . It looks like earth . It has people on it that look like humans . The skies are blue , the grass is green , and there are children playing . But something is a little bit off . The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie . The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth , that is if we forget how to love . It would 've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they 're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm.I unfortunately did not watch the end . Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end as well.Overall an artistic disappointment . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen , and yes , I have seen Cujo . Adam Sandler is an abomination as Schecky Moskowitz , a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner . That 's the plot . That 's it ! Nothing else in the film makes sense , it 's all over the place like a mad man 's breakfast , and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way , but more of a frustrating , ' throw both shoes at the t.v ' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance , for no reason i can comprehend ( it certainly wasn 't for humour ) . Add to the mix Miss Australia , who has the worst Australian Accent i 've ever heared , and you have something which i won 't call the worst film ever made , because Going overboard doesn 't even fit the basic definition of a film . I highly recomend seeing this film , as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see . I guarantee the first thing you 'll say after seeing a bad film will be " " at least it wasn 't as bad as Going Overboard " . " , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the worst brain damaged , ultra cheap , super stupid , silly , pointless piece of trash I 've ever seen , an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre .

" I 'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting , but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake.After seeing Der Untergang this is a huge disappointment . There 's no connection between different scenes , and the acting is so incredibly poor I couldn 't even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potential.And above all , everyone in Germany speaks English . Big mistake . The German language has a certain sound to it , and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he 's speaking / yelling German.The way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot , the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened.Whether it 's the English or the fact that I 've already seen Der Untergang , everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Don 't Drink the Water " " is an unbelievably bad film . It 's based on a 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen . It stars Jackie Gleason , the comic genius behind " " The Honeymooners " . " The director , Howard Morris , has appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies ( Life Stinks , High Anxiety , Silent Movie ) and has made a mark in animation ( characters he has voiced include Gopher from " " Pooh " , " Jughead ( Archie ) and Beetle Bailey ) What went wrong ? I think the problem is that the premise is played out too seriously to work effectively . Allen 's original play was tongue-in-cheek , which is why it worked on Broadway and in Allen 's 1994 remake . The screenplay by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beats the premise to death and makes too many changes from the original play . Making Gleason 's wife an airhead in this version when she was a headstrong woman in the original is just one example of why this doesn 't work.The acting isn 't much better . Gleason does the best he can with the material , but he can 't save this . Gleason was a comic genius , but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in " " The Hustler " " and " " Soldier in the Rain " . " His abrasive personality could have worked here , but the lousy script doesn 't even give him a chance . Too bad . Estelle Parsons ' airhead wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes . See how soon it 'll take for YOU to want to strangle her . That is also a shame because she is also a fine actress , having turned in two exceptional performances in " " Bonnie and Clyde " " and " " Rachel , Rachel " " None of the other actors do particularly well either.Woody Allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner ( Marge Simpson ) in the leads . They manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece . It 's finally on video after a long battle over rights . Do go out and find that version . All the 1969 original is good for is clearing out unwanted guests who overstay their welcome.1 / 2 * out of 4 stars , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself.I first saw the trailer in 1991 , it looked great.Since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it ..... until today , yes , 14 years later.lets just say I was so disappointed its unreal , OK i knew it wouldn 't be an Oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun no-brain film in the bloodsport mold .

" Wicked Little Things ( known in Australia as " " Zombies " " ) is a rare find 혯 a film that promises one thing but delivers another . It is one of the few genre films to be made by Millennium Pictures , a European film studio known for making various B-grade action films & thrillers , some featuring action star Jean-Claude Van Damme.Karen Tunny & her two daughters Sarah & Emma arrive in the Pennsylvanian town of Addytown in order to move into a large house that Karen 's late husband owned after finding a miner 's deed in his effects . Once arriving , they find that the house is very old & in need of repair . But the house 's condition is the least of their problems , as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances & Karen is confronted by the area 's owner & ordered to move out . Once night falls , the Tunnys find out the reason behind the vanishings : a group of zombie children , killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago , come out to kill anything that goes in the woods . With the help of a grizzled neighbour , Karen attempts to end the curse before her & her children become the next victims.I bought the DVD expecting a film with flesh-eating zombies , but was let down by one thing : the film is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie flick , with the dead children being the embodiment of a curse that haunts the woods , taking their revenge on anything that moves around at night ( although the internal logic is somewhat flawed 혯 the children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals & are repelled by blood wards on doors in the same manner that vampires are repelled by garlic & mirrors 혯 aren 't these kids supposed to be zombies ? ) . The plot as such would not be a problem & would actually be entertaining , but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie film , only to fall flat on their faces with this effort.As such , a film like this would be okay as a ghost story but , due to a poor script , becomes nothing more than an entirely routine effort . The film 's greatest strength is the acting , with the cast giving better performances than the film deserves . Of particular note is Scout Taylor-Compton , who does her role quite well 혯 it 's a shame she ruins her genre cred with a very poor performance in the HALLOWEEN remake ( or maybe it 's just Rob Zombie 's script ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have done quite a few reviews on IMDb and this film is unique in that I never saw the entire movie . It was so terribly stupid and unfunny that I just couldn 't sit through it--though I tried.The biggest problem with this and any Mel Brooks movie I call " " the Mel quotient " . " In other words , the better his movie , the less of him you see in the film . Think about it--The Producers and Young Frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them at all . BUT , films like Life Stinks and Space Balls are chock full of Mel and are pretty dopey movies ( yes , I DID NOT LIKE Space Balls--but this isn 't the place to talk about that ) .Second , apart from cancer , rectal itch and mental retardation , I can 't think of a less funny topic than homelessness . This is just a comedy breaker . Think about it , folks . The FUNNIEST ( ? ) scene in the movie has Mel making whoopee with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster ! !

" Amanda Bynes is an enormously talented actress , and I 've really enjoyed all of her roles in the past , especially in the fantastic " " She 's the Man . " " For that reason alone , " " Sydney White " " was a huge disappointment for me . The real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters . In a good fun teen comedy , its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly reality-based teen characters . In " " Sydney White , " " this idea is thrown out the window.Amanda Bynes makes a fine Sydney , but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her sparkle as an actress . I blame this on the script , which makes her character too bland and restrained , and on the hair / makeup department , which gives her a detestable plastic look and an annoying hair style . The seven " " dorks " " that Sydney eventually befriends are far worse . They are so dorky that it 's impossible to like them or even respect them as characters . They 're essentially repulsive gag fodder . As is the story 's " " Prince Charming , " " who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can be.Perhaps the film 's biggest star-to-be ( with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes ) is Sara Paxton , who 's actually very good as the conniving Rachel Witchburn . It 's just a shame that the script-writers didn 't make her a bit more gray than black.The plot is basically that of " " Snow White . " " What kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a re-imagining . The connections to " " Snow White " " are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown . Prince Charming is unrealistically charming , the " " witch " " is far too despicably witchy , the seven " " dorks " " are too dorky , and Sydney is just too pure of heart . Now , this is not to say that the movie is all bad . Though Bynes is forced down by the script , she still has her moments . As does Sara Paxton , who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes . Sydney 's room-mate , named " " Dinky " " is also great fun as a character . It 's a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clich챕d to recommend . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I love documentaries . They are among my favorite genres of film . Before seeing this film I hadn 't seen one that I hadn 't liked.The premise for this film is a great one . The execution is well done . There were some times early on when I laughed and smiled . Yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became . This could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate , childish , inept putz . I appreciate his passion for film , but quit your whining . If you 're short on funds , maybe you shouldn 't have so many kids , or spend so much money on alcohol . Maybe you should have gone to film school , or at least graduated from high school . Maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision . There are so many people out there with stories that are interesting , funny and poignant . To see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass . If you want to do a documentary on a film maker , why not do one on someone from China or Iran , a film maker with REAL problems ?

" First , and foremost , I take issue to the title of this movie . ' Chupacabra ' is not a Spanish word . The name to which they are referring is ' Chupacabras ' . I imagine they dropped the ' s ' because it sounds plural that way , but I assure you , it is singular in Spanish.Next , I thought this movie had been done years ago . It came off as one of those B horror flicks I watched when I was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town . Then it would have been kind of scary.Let 's talk about the special effects . The most important ' effect ' is the costume used for the Chupacabras . Given that it is the main character , you would think some serious money would have been put into it , but that isn 't so . The shape , color , and texture were all goofy like some stupid haunted house at Disney World.There were times when the Chupacabras was walking where no man could walk . His movement were jerky and strange at these times , but moving around on the floor looked like any normal man.Another thing I take issue to is that there is no animal in the world that goes around slaughtering everything it sees with no regard to actually eating it . The Chupacrabas would kill one , then the next , but it never seemed to actually eat the victim . You say , " " It 's just a movie , " " and I agree . But the idea is so far out there that it 's stupid.What country is Dr. Pena from ? He sounds sort of Jamaincan / Hawaiian / British / Something-Else , but I think he 's supposed to be Latino . The problem is , his accent is so bad that even a Russian could tell he wasn 't Latino.The soldiers fired round after round at this thing , and weren 't making a dent , yet the continued to fire . I 'm no military man , but don 't soldiers , especially the special tactical forces such as this , have to have some wit about them to perform their duties ? Wouldn 't they figure out that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new ? They didn 't . They just kept firing away while the Chupacabras continued to slaughter , and not eat , them.Did they have to kill the little dog ? : ) Anyway , my vote was 3 for this flick , because it was bad . Why did I watch the whole thing ? I 'm sure you 've done the same on occasion , so don 't give me an flack . ; ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I saw this movie when it was released , and my distaste for it has stuck with me all these years .

" * Spoiler warning * First of all I rated this movie 2 out of 10.The idea is good , but there are too many stupid errors in the movie , failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been . First of all she never fights alone . After an initial very strange doubt from her mother ( which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie ) the rape victim is not alone . She is also unbelievably naive always falling into the Crew 's strange traps . Her friends are unbelievably nasty.The thing that I find most unbelievably is that Ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon . Ethan is very much the leader of the Crew ( hey , they even say so ) and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk , but when Ethan changes his opinion he just doesn 't manage to convince even one single person in the Crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong . Everyone just simply hates him ... why ? ? The movie provides no explanation . How did he ever become the leader ?

" I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it . The movie , however , did not meet my expectations . Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies . The characters didn 't seem to fit very well with the book . The direction was weak . I had a hard time getting into the characters . There wasn 't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on . The dialog didn 't explain adequately what was happening . It just seemed slapped together and rushed through . All in all I was very disappointed with the movie .

" As a rule , I try to find as much in films as I possibly can to enjoy them . I made no exceptions with " " Tart " , " doing my very best to appreciate it for what it was . But no effort , no matter how great , could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie.It failed for a number of reasons . Firstly , the cinematography was directionless and ineffective . Secondly , the script reached depths of ' poor ' that took it well and truly beyond the ' so bad it 's good ' category . Thirdly , the acting left mind-blowing amounts to be desired - it was appalling , it really was . Anyone who saw Mischa Barton ( seen here as the remarkably terrible Grace , a character so poorly invented and realised that Ja Ja Binks doesn 't seem so bad ) as Devon in John Duigan 's " " Lawn Dogs " " will wonder what went wrong between then and now . Perhaps , had she been given a character worth bothering with , and a modicum of direction , she at least might have given this film ONE redeeming feature . Alas , such was not the case . Finally , the film seemed to have no point whatsoever , expressing nothing , achieving nothing . Really , I wonder why Christina Wayne bothered . " " Tart " " made a feeble attempt to be something , and failed . The result - a film , sadly , so bad that it 's just very , very bad .

That didn 't sound very hopeful , and alas , it was worse than I 'd suspected.A laddish Robin I can take ; a Robin who tangles with a pert dyer 's daughter I can credit ; but a Robin who exchanges not-very-funny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow , and a Robin and * entire cast * who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom . How could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without re-shooting the scenes ? Again and again , Much sounds as if he 's struggling with half-comprehended Shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip ; I hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick , but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the cast.Whatever else you say about Errol Flynn in the role , he had the knack of delivering high-flown dialogue as naturally as if he 'd just thought it up on the spur of the moment ... and as this production shows , that 's not at all as easy as it sounds ! If they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies , the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines : they sound as if they haven 't a clue how to handle them.I 'm afraid I didn 't even like the pantomime Sheriff , for a similar reason ; the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered ( and in this case written ) with a nudge and a wink at the audience . They 're out of place all right -- fourth-wall-busting stuff -- but really not that funny.This much-promised production reminded me of a limping school play . The only actor and character I felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing Guy of Gisbourne , who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on ( a ) credible villainy and ( b ) credible characterisation -- but frankly , I wouldn 't have said that was a very good augury for the future of the series ! As of the time of writing , I 'll give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week , with less stilted scene-setting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue : after all , the opening episode of " " Doctor Who " " wasn 't exactly a show-stopper , though it was nowhere near as bad as this . But if I see no improvement after episode 2 , I 'm afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewer.Which would be a pity , because I 've got a soft spot for the " " Robin Hood " " legend on screen , from the adventures of Douglas Fairbanks to the sturdy reliance of Richard Greene . But this Robin fails to stir my blood in the slightest . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really don 't know why I agreed to watch this movie , but like a complete fool I did and for that I deserve to be shot ! I had seen the original Killjoy , well I say I have seen it .... I started watching it but found it that bad that I ended up watching it in 4x speed to get it over with and get rid of the annoying dialogue , but I said I would watch it and I did even if it was in 4x speed.To cut a long story short Killjoy 2 kicks off where Killjoy left off . By this i don 't mean the plot , I mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheapness . I have nothing against low budget movies , in fact I kinda enjoy them , they are something different from Mega budget blockbusters , but this film is just terrible ! The acting is diabolical and the script ... well i think you could of given Stevie Wonder a pen and paper , and he would of produced something much better ! This movie is just annoying , not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has which is so obviously dubbed ! I didn 't make it through this movie anyway , about three quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window . It may of been a rip off to buy as a DVD but as a frisbee it was a mega bargain ! Please for the love of mankind itself DO NOT watch this muck , it is possibly the worst thing I have ever seen and considering some of the muck I 've seen thats saying a lot ! My rating on this movie would be .... Nailgun to the head / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There are some things I can never understand . Such as this movie . What if I were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking Dino and crocodile polygon model in Maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing ? How can anyone even believe that an utterly fake CGI dinocroc that looks completely out of place , would influence the events in this movie ? I know that its B-grade , low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through . It just does 'nt make sense . Are people really so stupid that they would sit through this ? Apparently so . For laughs ? No , this thing isn 't even worth laughing at . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ahem .. I think I 'll be the only one who 's saying this but yes , I was a lil bored during the film . Not to say that this is a bad movie , in fact it 's a very good attempt at portraying the innermost emotions - dilemma , sorrow , love .. , esp it 's the director 's debut ( read from somewhere , is it true ? ) . I felt that something 's not quite right , maybe it 's just me , I 'm not drawn to the characters enough to immerse me in their world . This is a simple story , about ordinary people , ordinary lives . Through simple and short dialogs , the director tries to relate a simple guy 's life , and how copes with the news of his illness by laughing it away every time . Oh ya his laughter was kinda cute at first but gradually it gets to me , such a deep hearty roar for a gentle man ! I must say , I didn 't feel the impact that most readers felt , in fact I was more drawn to the trivial scenarios like spitting of watermelon seeds with his sis that clearly shows that they 're comfortable with each other , the granny who came back for another shot - this is kinda melancholic , the thoughtful gesture of writing down the procedures for his dad - hmm but this is predictable .. Don 't misunderstood that I 'm an action-lover , independent films are my cup of tea ! Perhaps I just have a really high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger imagery . Some Asian films worth the watch : Tony Takitani ( depicts loneliness ) Wayward Cloud ( only 1 dialog ) My Sassy Girl ( I like it ! ) 4.30 ( loneliness as well ) 15 ( gangsters lives in local setting ) Before sunrise and Before sunset ( I just have to mention these even though they are not Asian films .

" I 've seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it , the less I like it . Jamie Lynn Spears was approached to do this because of the fact that she is Britney 's sister and I 'm sorry to say that that in the show is obvious . They 've created the character Zoey to be everything people want to believe Jamie Lynn is , clever , original , smart , pretty , popular etc . The characters around her are only there to make her look better , by being smarter then them , more popular than them , more wanted by boys then them . There is nothing original about this and it 's poured with money , so every kid there has the coolest of fashions and stuff . I also have to say , for a 13 year old girl ( or however old she is , can 't be much older ) she wears very mature clothing , those short skirts are too short , it makes young people want to wear them , and all that make-up , this adds to the rising problems of why young girls get into so much trouble . The only thing I will say is that the opening credits are sung by Jamie Lynn and , given her age , isn 't bad at all , much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal ability . Sorry , it 's too mature and yet too dumbed down . It 's poorly acted with predictable story lines and there is far too much stereotyping going on too . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * * * SPOILERS * * * A hot and sexy Linda Blair as the Witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset with her friend and rival Witch across town Erica Barens , Julie Strain . Amelia getting her husband Hal , Edward Albert , to get a promotion at his job at the Giger & Greengrass law-firm over the more deserving Larry Barnes , Larry Poindexter , who happens to be married to Erica has her cast a spell on Hal causing him to lose control of his car and end up almost killing himself.Larry finding out about Erica 's attempt on his best friend Larry 's life has a violent fight with her causing Erica to fall from the balcony to her death . It 's when Larry goes back to his ex-wife Carol , Rochelle Sanson , that things begin to really heat up , emotional and sexually . The wicked Amelia tries to have the dead spirit of Erica take over Carol 's body and end up murdering Larry who she holds as being responsible for her husband Hal 's injury that left him permanently confined to a wheelchair.Not much of a story but lot 's of cheese and soft-core action with poor Larry getting manipulated by Amelia through the resurrection of Erica who plans to kill him the first chance he turns his back on her . Amelia is a bit whacked out herself not exactly knowing who is and who isn 't a threat to her . Amelia even gets her poor and innocent gardener Stan , Michael Parks to first lose him family in a bloody house invasion break-in , then his mind , by being accused by the police as being the murderer , and finally is life , by getting blasted by Ameila herself . As he 's made to runs into the Reynolds ' house , under her control , as mad as a hatter trying to murder both her and the crippled Hal . Larry Parks looked and acted so weird that you had the feeling that he accidentally walked onto the set of " " Sorceress " " and ended up being in the cast playing his part as Stan . Without the help or benefit of a script he improvised his way through and then slowly realized just how god-awful bad the movie really is . Stan getting killed off early in the film was a big plus for him since he didn 't have to suffer , like those of us watching , through the entire brainless and mind-numbing movie.It becomes evident to you as well as it did to the makers of " " Sorceress " " that all this shenanigan 's on the screen has to come to some kind of hopeful and successful conclusion and a trick ending is put in to finally end the movie . The ending is about the best thing , besides Miss Blair and the rest of the very well-endowed woman cast , that one can say about the film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

And that 's all this film plays off . The blindness of MR MAGOO .

" On Broadway , A Chorus Line was pure magic . From the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale , a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show , we were totally engaged - captivated by the intensely personal stories , some funny , some clever , some stirring , of this chorus line . The movie is another matter entirely . The focus is now on the director - and WHAT an ogre he is ! Every time the film switches to Michael Douglas , there he is with a bitter , sour expression , barking out questions and orders , screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance . Yikes ! ! That changes the dynamics of the story . On Broadway , the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence , but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong / fragile / intriguing / hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity . There is a reason this work won the Pulitzer Prize ! And actually in one of the only moments the director appears , he is there to comfort the young Puerto Rican Dancer after we hear that dancer 's heart-breaking story . He appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection / concern for Cassie . But in the movie , from the second Douglas ' director starts bitterly barking orders , the chorus line members ' stories become secondary . It 's like they are in a lousy profession , where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show , is jaded , exhausted , furious at having to audition these chorus members . On stage , there was ALWAYS the excitement of the show . Here in the movie practically from the word go , you feel sorry for everyone involved . During the course of the musical , we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well , and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job ! But of course that couldn 't happen . But in the Finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage , sometimes reflecting us in the audience , in our hearts , and we know , also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected , they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much , bringing magic to the theatre . In the movie , after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis , that magic becomes totally diluted . All we feel ( even with the exact same curtain call ) , is that some of the members got a job with a mean-spirited director . So they all come on the screen and are dancing again . Big deal . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres , who makes this film watchable -- if not really believable herself as she 's cast as a bit of a heterosexual sex hound .

" Everything about this show is terrible . Its premise even sets itself up to get cheap laughs with bad writing . A " " disfunctional family " " -theme has already been used too many times , most notably by the Simpsons , which is an excellent show with great writing and many laughs . Meanwhile , Family Guy has about five minutes of story in each episode , with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in . Now , if this was original or funny , sure , I 'd think it was clever . But no , it 's not funny at all . In fact , the only reason the episodes are like this is because it is the easiest way to effortlessly crank out episode after episode of this junk . Much of this show is unoriginal , and what is original is just lame . It is also amazingly crude and irreverent , which again can be fine if it 's still intelligent . Animation isn 't everything either , but from an artistic point of view , this show fails also , proving yet again that Family Guy strives for as many cheap jokes and easy shortcuts as possible . People enjoy this show , and I don 't really care , because people can enjoy anything they want , no matter how much it aims for the lowest common denominator .

" " " The Yoke 's on Me " " is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the Stooges ' 23 years of shorts . The reason is understandable ; by today 's standards , this film can be considered racist . For this reason , it is rarely shown , if ever , on television.Let me just state that , for the record , the Japanese seen in the film were not soldiers ; they were Japanese-Americans sent to a relocation center during World War II . They were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this film . By all accounts - including the US government , who made an apology and reparations in the 1980s - Japanese-Americans during World War II were as loyal and hardworking as any American . Their imprisonment during this time is a dark blot in American history.There are some Stooge laughs in this film , but the memories of how Japanese-Americans were treated during this time sullies the entertainment value . Let 's not confuse the loyal Japanese-Americans with their representation in this film as evildoers .

I really liked the story line to an extent and the characters were likable but the film on a whole was just awful .

" Okay , When I bought this flick I though this gotta be the ultimate b-movie , space monkey landing to the Earth and starts right away to kill people ! Well , It was almost everything what I expected , typical low-budget scifi movie from the 60 's . Acting has to be the worst I 've ever seen , especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off . So why ' Night Fright ' doesn 't fall in to category ' so bad that it 's good ' ? Reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring . For example the scene were the police officers are searching clues in the woods it was just minutes of walking without purpose . And then the grand finale , the people 's waiting for the monster about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears it get wack 'd in 20 second , end of film.Yeah , ' Night Fright ' is boring , but it got couple of funny moments .

" Dare Rudd ( John Wayne ) and sidekick Dink Hooley ( Syd Saylor ) are itinerant cowpunchers who can 't seem to stay in one place very long . In " " Helltown " , " the boys are headed to Montana , where they meet up with Rudd 's cousin Tom Fillmore ( Johnny Mack Brown ) , who offers them a job . It 's a hoot to see the boys wearing aprons as they start out as cooks with the herd , although Dare becomes self conscious when Miss Judith ( Marsha Hunt ) rides into camp . Judy is Tom 's girl , but the attraction between her and Dare is evident early on.Fillmore has a cattle herd to move , and promotes Dare to running the drive , partly to prove to Judy that he may not be up to the task . Meanwhile , bad guy Bart Hammond ( Monte Blue ) has his eyes on Fillmore 's cattle , but when his henchmen fail to rustle the herd , he figures it 's easier to win the money that Dare was paid at the end of the trail . Conning Dare into a rigged card game with his man Brady ( James Craig ) , Dare 's money begins to evaporate hand after hand . It 's only when Dare fails to show up back at Fillmore 's ranch that Tom goes out to find his cousin . Exposing the cheats , Tom , Dare and Dink high tail it before the bad guys can get their revenge . " " Helltown " , " also known as " " Born to the West " , " was released in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation , a couple of years after Wayne 's series of Westerns for Lone Star Productions . It only slightly alters the Lone Star formula ; Wayne does get the girl at the end of the film , but here he was trying . There 's a great runaway horse scene where Wayne rescues Marsha Hunt , in which Johnny Mack Brown 's horse does a complete somersault spill . Syd Saylor does a nice job as the comic relief pal , doing his best to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims . He replaces familiar faces George " " Gabby " " Hayes and Yakima Canutt here , staples of the Lone Star films . John Wayne 's charisma is beginning to develop here , preparing him for the leap to super star status that he eventually achieved . " " Helltown " " was based on a novel by legendary Western author Zane Grey . If you 're looking for more films based on Grey 's stories , try " " Fighting Caravans " " with Gary Cooper , " " The Light of Western Stars " " with Victor Jory , " " Drift Fence " " with Buster Crabbe , and " " Heritage of the Desert " " with Randolph Scott . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As an ancient movie fan , I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others . I decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film . I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch . The beginning quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me ... why to entail a sentence from the Gospel by Mark in the movie about pagan Rome ? But the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple ( Caligula and Drusilla ) running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental . The music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense . Yet , the negative feelings raised in me quite soon , particularly at the death of Tiberius . The cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated . However , it was not that horrific to the middle . During the second half of the film , I felt as if I watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn . In the end , I said to myself " " This is one of the movies that one may really hate " " ... I am aware that a movie may be controversial but I had never expected that CALIGULA would go that far in removing all limits of taste . I hate this film due to many reasons , but particularly one.CALIGULA does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic ( which it claims to be ) , but Bob Guccione , the director and the founder of Penthouse pornographic magazine , aims at combining film art with porn . That is , I think , the most serious matter the film may be accused of . Movie is an art that should be reigned by taste , by message , by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste . CALIGULA shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked , decadent manner . Some scenes are so disgusting that I don 't think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them . Some say that the Rome under Caligula 's reign was so brutal . Yes , it is true . Corruption bloomed at that time , various sexual deviances were preferable to Roman citizens . Yet , I do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic . I believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies ... HUGE HISTORICAL MISTAKES : The screenplay by Gore Vidal is notorious for inaccuracies . It is noticeable , for instance , with the figure of Proculus ( Donato Placido ) , a historic Roman senator . Yet , the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom Caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes . Moreover , Livia was not Proculus wife raped by Caesar on her wedding . What lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence ? Another example of historical travesty is the figure of Caesonia portrayed by Helen Mirren . She is presented as Caligula 's wife together with Drusilla , his sister . In fact , Caligula married Caesonia long after the death of his sister . The sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases . I also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts . TECHNICAL ASPECT AND CAST : From the technical point of view , the film is nothing special . The cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding . Yet , the only strong point of the movie are the performances , particularly the one by Malcolm McDowall as Caligula . He does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor . McDowall raises the value of the film . If everything bothers you in CALIGULA , you may at least admire his performance . I also fancied Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla ( yet the film is based on a gossip by Suetonius that Caligula made love to his sister ) . Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O 'Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable . O 'Toole does his finest piece of acting in the Capri Grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor . Yes , I admit that THE ONLY THING I like about CALIGULA are the performances . Therefore , I don 't rate the movie 1 / 10.LAME CONTINUITY : The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity . Let us analyze just the beginning : Caligula comes to Capri Grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old Tiberius . Then , after about 15 minutes , the action moves to Rome where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula 's bed constitutes a bad omen . And immediately the characters are again in Capri where Nerva ( John Gielgud ) is dying ... ? All in all , I don 't recommend to see CALIGULA to anyone . If you want to know the story , read Robert Graves ' gorgeous novel I , CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or watch Herbert Wise 's mini series with the magnificent performance by Derek Jacobi . CALIGULA is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art . It is , in its most part , a porn movie that should never be called an epic.There are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen people 's taste of beauty , there are movies that are average entertainment ; yet they have something to offer , there are movies that show extreme violence ; yet they still convey some moral , there are , however , movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm people 's minds , CALIGULA unfortunately belongs to the latest group , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This " " remake " " is a complete disgrace : so mediocre , cheap and prosaic , it wouldn 't deserve more than a couple of spiteful lines.It 's also a cheat , with a laughable script served by such contrived and amateurish " " acting " , " you 're always aware there 's a set , a camera , a fake , no direction , no suspended reality whatsoever to allow you delve into the story.The claustrophobic , stifling tension of the small spaces and rooms in the original Japanese masterpieces ( Ju-On 1 & 2 ) is all but lost here in overblown sets and spaces.But worst of all , the moral enormity and unbearable suffering , which both imparted a ruthless logic to the original mother and child victims turned into relentlessly vindictive ghouls , is completely ruined by utter nonsense and hollow boogie-man style scares.If American audiences aren 't willing to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator , preferring to swallow this kind of patronizing hogwash instead , they fully deserve this pathetic curse : the movie itself . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My friends and I rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile . The movie is not supposed to be funny at all , but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever . First , Phillippe ( I forget what his character is called and I don 't really care ) uses his regular employee ID to go through all the top-security terminals . Not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the so-scary Lego-room , which hosts the super computers . This is plain funny . The tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room . The ending , like all else , is very very very cheesy , especially when the bad guy 's lawyer shows up ' right on time ' . Anyway , this movie is a good laugh . If you need something to make fun of , definitely see it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Holy crap . This was the worst film I have seen in a long time . All the performances are fine , but there is no plot . Really ! No plot ! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that 's your film . Ug ... Robert Duvall 's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over . This earns him the same responses over and over . I am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it . Good performances with famous and well regarded actors , but the actual complete work is a steamy turd . Well , maybe that 's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film NOTHING HAPPENS ! Sack , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For the Straight Guy , or Jack from Will and Grace would have fit easily into the role that Nick Mancuso gave us.The movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody - or an excuse to show the Paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor . What ? They can 't afford a room ? I did find it cute that the Madame ( Irina Malysheva ) felt she was doing her patriotic duty taking care of the soldier 's needs.The movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts - and I mean a lot !

I laughed once and that was when : EVAN : " " im building something " " Evan 's Secretary : " " i hope its a barber shop " " That was literally the only time i laughed in this ' comedy ' , awful compared to Bruce almighty which as a big Jim carrey fan ... wasn 't even that great ! This movie lacked the humour of having God 's powers and was more about family bonding . Id class it solely as a family movie , definitely not a family comedy . Seeing a bird poo on someone 's shirt is not hilarious , neither is a beard that grows back instant !

I feel embarrassed for her now , having people know it was her . When she sang the Star Spangled Banner I had to turn the sound off--then I came here and discovered they did that because she won Star Search .

People aren 't born bad . Neither are they born good . They are born with a clean slate . It 's society , parents and education what makes them who they are . And if they take the wrong turn , somewhere down the line , it certainly isn 't going to be the American penal system that gets them back on track ! Anyway , avoid this movie like the plague .

" Story of the creation of Underdog and adventures battling Simon Bar Sinister in a live action format . First we have Showshine picked up off the street and brought to a science experiment lab where Simon Bar Sinister works . He fights back when Sinister tries to inject him with a chemical and accident occurs , he gets superpowers and the lab blows up wounding Sinister . On the street Shoeshine runs afoul of Riff Raff , another dog and gets picked up by Jim Belushi who was a guard at the lab . Belushi 's son discovers that Shoeshine has all these powers and eventually Shoeshine becomes Underdog , who will once again battle Sinister.Once you decided that under dog was going to be a real dog you 've sort of limited yourself as to whether the film was going to work or not . For me the film half works and half doesn 't . The part that doesn 't is all of the stuff where you see Shoeshine , the dog , as a dog with his master . Some of the repartee is funny , but it just drags on and on as we get introduced to Sweet Polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets see what you can do stuff . Its a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the film . Its painfully dull and feels like it takes forever to get through it , which considering the film is say 75 minutes sans credits , is something you don 't want to do.The parts that are good are anything with Simon Bar Sinister ( Peter Dinklage is a blast ) and anything where Underdog goes into action . Some how somewhere they managed to find a way to be both twistedly true to the spirit of the cartoon and to update it . Of course I could be wrong since the middle section is so dull , but I think not , since I do look forward to catching the end of this again on cable.As a whole its probably as awful as some people have said , but if you can wait for cable where you can stumble on the good parts , this is an okay cartoon to film adaption . ( But wait for cable-really ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Based on a fairly bland " " best seller , " " this film - like most other Lifetime movies - played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie . The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter wasn 't in it . The women in this don 't age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad.The characters in this were all clich챕 and one-dimensional . The story was of the cheesy nature . I wouldn 't recommend it , but it 's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great . I only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to see it so she wouldn 't have to read the book her sister loaned to her . It wasn 't made for someone like me - my girlfriend cried a little at the end though , so she didn 't think it was as terrible as I did . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" No one is a greater fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser 's Flashman papers than I am.I was surprised to see just now that Richard Lester directed Royal Flash , since I also see he had made the Three / Four Musketeers with Fraser which I though turned out rather well.Not so Royal Flash.I was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since I had read all the Flashman papers published up to that time , and was intoxicated with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel ( I still am , but he was never really given a chance after that ) .What a disappointment ( I saw it once again when I was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse ) .None of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen . The comedy of Flashman 's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do . The dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic.Looking back with more mature eyes , the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the Prisoner of Zenda.If you have read the book and not seen the film , I can only say that the film ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game Rudi has just invented : Russian roulette.A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about.My comments would be more direct if I had seen the film more recently , but I am glad I have not.If by any chance Fraser ever reads this , I can only say I think he is a genius--perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation , but , based on my appreciation of that corpus of work , it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film , as that he did all those awful Roger Moore James Bond films . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" POPEYE AND BIG FOOT * * ; POPEYE 'S ENGINE COMPANY * * ; GETTING POPEYE 'S GOAT * * 1 / 2I used to lap these up as a kid but , catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back-to-back now i.e. several years later ( they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [ 1953 ] ) , I can see how they don 't hold up all that well ! The character of Popeye isn 't exactly sympathetic to begin with , Olive Oyl distinctly overbearing and Bluto 's antics failed to elicit much interest either 혯 in short , the scripts were alarmingly thin , fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot . They 're strictly juvenile fare , yet I doubt today 's kids would even have the patience to stick with them ! ; furthermore , the animation style is unattractive.Taking each short per se , I guess they improved from one to the other : after the initial shock , one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were , so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot 혯 Popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief ( hardly original , I know , but always an amusing ploy ) . One interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with Popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I am a huge Randolph Scott fan , so I was surprised and disappointed to find he is barely in this film ! The movie really belongs to Robert Ryan , who is the hero in the jam , and the one embroiled in the love triangle . Good grief , Gabby Hayes gets more screen time than Mr. Scott in this movie ! ! For many viewers , that is not a problem , but I am from the Walter Brennan school of sidekicks , not Gabby Hayes ... although I will say that his lines were a bit more humorous than annoying in this film than in many of his films with Randolph Scott and John Wayne.Personally , I found the movie very slow going , with a convoluted plot that was muddied even more by the unnecessary romance subplot . By convoluted , I don 't mean impossible to understand or figure out , I just mean too messy for its own good.The direction is uninspired , and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfying come-uppance at the end . The whole movie comes across as fake , unrealistic , and poorly filmed.Just so you don 't think I can 't find anything good here ... On the plus side , Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her all-too-brief parts of this film . Not sure if it is actually her singing , or someone else , but whoever it was had a very pretty voice . Ms. Jeffreys also had a couple of nice acting moments . The script needed either a lot more of her , or to remove her character altogether . As it was , her nice few moments weren 't enough to help the film.Lastly , there is Mr. Scott . He looks fantastic in this film and is the no-nonsense lawman out to set things right . Some folks complain that his characters prior to 1950 were too goody-goody perfect , but that 's never bothered me at all . I 'll take him goody-goody pre-1950 , or gritty and violent post-1950 ... either way , Randolph Scott was a real Western hero.It saddens me to have to say it , but I would have to recommend passing this film by , unless you are a die-hard fan ... there are so many better Scott films out there that this one won 't be missed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance , however moronic this illogical ' logic ' may be . However within the story and theme of the film , there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the film 's antagonist , is the " villain of the story " . Under no circumstances can what she did be justified . Sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality . It is betrayal of the ultimate sort . The man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man 's offspring . To top it all , the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 ' liberated ' female characters in the climax is pathetic . A woman 's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse , there are no other children . So in essence his life has been wasted . In some societies where justice still prevails , such situations result in the execution of the unjust . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Comparing Oceans Twelve to the 2001 Oceans Eleven , did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same ? - All the stars returned for Twelve , and Zeta-Jones was added ; - Twelve had the same director ; - Twelve had the same producers ; - Twelve had the same production designer ; - Twelve had the same music director ; - Twelve had the same film editor.Did anyone notice the things than changed once the " " Oceans " " franchise was established ? - Twelve 's budget was $ 25 million ( 30 % ) greater ; - Eleven got great reviews , but Twelve largely got panned ; - Eleven made $ 450 million but Twelve dropped to $ 362 million ; - Domestic box office for Twelve dropped 32 % ; - Soderbergh teamed with a different screenwriter.Movies are a director 's medium , of course .

" As a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships , too , I cannot see the movie as a movie , only . As a movie is has some great , wonderful shots of the ship , most of them done on an existing vessel - apart of the ones in the disaster scenes , of course , and a certain room under deck . But regarding the story and dialogs I only can call it big crap . Nothing of that would happen like this on a real sailing vessel . No wonder , the film had bad impact on the existing ship - if I didn 't know better , I wasn 't tempted to do a sailing voyage for sure . Definitely , for Europeans I recommend to switch off once the ship ran aground . After that , the over-emotional , very American part begins which I couldn 't bear .

I thought , hey this could be interesting , then I found out how absolutely , insanely , ridiculously stupid it really was .

" Well I will come clean and admit that I was forced as part of my history degree to watch this film , and then write a short film review as part of my grade.Yet even if I had watched the film alone , at my own discretion I found it extremely boring and absurd . The style is dated beyond its years , and the acting is farcical . Rather than use dialogue they instead exchange eye popping glances at each other , or sometimes into thin air . For me , such over the top acting does not convey any greater emotion , and after seeing an extreme close up Ivan 's face for the hundredth time I was praying for the film to end.The most disappointing though is how wrong Ivan 's character is . This man was nasty , his bodyguard 's murderous thugs and his character cowardly .

" It 's strange what fate does to some people . While looking in the discount bin at a DVD retailer , I came across a copy of Deadly Instincts . Being a collector of any film that is either sci-fi , horror or featuring alien monsters , I decided to buy it ( not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars 혯 a bargain , believe me ) . After viewing it , I came to the opinion that it was nothing special . But after doing some research on the Internet , I discovered that the film was actually called Breeders & was a remake of the Tim Kincaid horror flick that menaced video stores in the mid-1980s . Which I 've already seen . My appreciation of " " Deadly Instincts " " grew following that discovery.A meteorite crashes on the lawn next to a private girls ' college . The sole teacher there , Ashley ( played by Todd Jensen 혯 that 's right , the guy who gets turned into a cyborg in the cult flick CYBORG COP four years earlier ) , notices that some of the students are beginning to disappear , while encountering a black-haired woman with a scarred face & wearing a kinky leather outfit . His investigation reveals that an alien creature had hitched a ride on the meteorite & had come to Earth to breed using the local womenfolk . Along with a local detective who believes him to be responsible for the disappearances , Ashley tries to stop the monster.The original BREEDERS , directed by Tim Kincaid ( who would leave the genre to make gay porn ) , was a sci-fi / horror film which was actually a thinly-veiled soft-core porn film designed to take skin flicks to genre fans . It is , in my belief , one of the worst films made in the 1980s . Why anyone would want to remake it is quite a mystery.This remake is actually a better effort than its low-budget source . The film , which takes the basic concept of an alien monster trying to interbreed with human women , eliminates any pornographic elements . In fact , the film is actually very tame . There are no sex scenes , no nudity ( even during the shower scene ) , swearing & violence are kept to a minimal level & there is no gore ( which may cheat gorehounds ) . This makes the remake a film safe for the whole family , that is if the kids aren 't scared by alien monsters ( which brings me to the film 's M 15 + rating , which seems a bit much ) .Tameness of subject matter aside , the film does have some faults . The script , while featuring some good characterizations , has a number of holes so big you can crash a meteor through.What ? You 're mad at me for that ? Come on , this review needed a bad pun so it will remain interesting.Anyway , the film 's setting is one problem the script failed to fix 혯 the film is set in Boston but the buildings don 't look like they belong in Boston . Something about the architecture ain 't right . Another thing is the college itself , with a rather large building housing about twenty students ( all female , of course ) & only having one class 혯 art . The only teacher there has a relationship with a student ( & so does the janitor ! ) , which somehow escapes the attention of the principal . Not to mention the cops , who are so one-dimensional ( & stupid ) that the real Boston PD would have a good case if they ever decided to sue . Oh , & the meteor혚 well the chance that a meteor which is sent from Saturn ( check the opening credits ) reaches Earth with no onboard propulsion is astronomical . That doesn 't include the chances that any passengers in the meteor will survive the landing.As far as the acting goes , Todd Jensen gives a dependable performance as the heroic teacher while the late Kadamba Simmons ( who was murdered by her boyfriend shortly before the film came out ) cuts a striking figure in that leather outfit , as well as proving she can act . The visual effects are run-of-the-mill , with credits due to the filmmakers for bringing us a cool-looking monster . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw the 7.5 IMDb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented . She said she had seen it before . " " It 's funny and sad ! I cried the first time I saw it , " " she gushed . Maybe compared to other Bollywood movies this deserves a 7.5 out of 10 , but in comparison to all the other movies I have seen in my lifetime , this deserves no more than a 3 . Any movie where I can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no good for me . The characters are unbelievable , how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived . It is over dramatic and the songs aren 't all that great . My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety . All the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic . Any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song . I think I understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song . The stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary ( we get it , Laxman isn 't the sharpest tool in the shed ) . If a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just isn 't meaningful , just a bit embarrassing . * * * * * SPOILER * * * * * Generally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told . Too many plot holes to count . At first the movie was amusing and cute in the way Bollywood movies are to people who don 't watch them that avidly but it just got tedious . It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartwrenching parts at the end . * * * * * SPOILER OVER * * * * * Perhaps it had a very little more depth than other Bollywood movies that I have seen , but not much at all . I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny . I didn 't shed a single tear nor did I feel like it , rather I was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending . I don 't recommend this movie if you want to watch something good , I recommend it if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that is kind of sad . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" surely this film was hacked up by the studio ? perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad , criminal indeed , writing and directing.i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the stylised acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhands , but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of tropes but only the offensive tripe of affectation. ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale.finally not that scary , indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless horseman would suffice , no need for the myth about a german mercenary , although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing - seeing the horsemans head makes him seem far friendlier that a decapitated inhuman nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend.no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in burtons oevure. stilted and clipped as my parting shot ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I LOVE Don Knotts , let me just say that up-front ! He is an enormous talent and the best at what he does , which is portray a nervous , lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority . He is fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming , the Reluctant Astronaut , but the film is pretty dull , really , even though as a kid my brother and I delighted in watching this and his other films . It 's still worth watching but really it 's a film that is best enjoyed by children . I 'd categorize it as 100 % family-friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night.As with all of Knotts ' films , there 's a great cast of beloved character actors and you can 't help but smile when Knotts gives one of his shaky , open-mouthed stares , no matter how old and jaded you are.From an adult perspective , one thing I think that is great about this film is how it captures NASA in the 1960s -- all the new modern buildings , the hope , the optimism , the future ! And I was surprised at how suave and studly Leslie Neilsen was back then . Only complaint about the story is Roy 's love interest , a rather threadbare , unlikeable woman who can 't give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot -- if you 're like me , you 'll be hoping that he gives her the shove-off at the end . Beware -- you 'll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching , it 's that catchy . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As Ben Elton once observed , nothing goes quicker out of style than comedy . Steve Martin 's latest offering - ' The Pink Panther 2 ' - recently opened to bad reviews and dismal box-office grosses , while Mike Myers ' ' The Love Guru ' seems to have won few admirers.In 1970 , it was Jerry Lewis ' turn to feel the pain of rejection ( ironically , his character in this film experiences a funny turn whenever anyone uses that word in his presence ) when ' Which Way To The Front ? ' effectively drove him off the big screen for almost a decade.In this World War Two comedy , he plays ' Brendan Byers 111 ' , the richest man in the world , who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty ( and also because he is bored with being successful ) but is rejected as he is medically unfit . He then decides to start his own privately funded army , recruiting other 4-F 's.Decked out with ludicrous uniforms that look like those worn by ' International Rescue ' in ' Thunderbirds ' , they go into training . Some good visual gags here . When they fire rocket launchers , they look pleased with themselves , until they learn they have just destroyed a Texaco oil station ! Wishing to learn German , Brendan plays a long-playing record called ' Songs To Mein Kampf By ' . When this army sits down to eat , instead of being in a draughty mess hall , they are in an opulent room decked out with a chandelier.John Wood is very funny as ' Finkel ' , Byers ' ever-so English butler . His best scene is when he blackmails a Mafia-type gangster into teaching Byers ' brigade to kill.The script was not by Jerry himself , but by Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso , author of a number of episodes of ' The Monkees ' . ' Front ' often has the look and feel of a television sitcom , indeed at times you almost expect to hear a laugh-track.Where it goes badly wrong is in the last thirty minutes when Byers replaces a top Nazi commander and , after ordering the Germans to withdraw from the front , gets involved in the plot to kill Hitler ( and Tom Cruise is nowhere in sight ! ) . As the commander , Jerry delivers a performance of such mind-numbing ineptitude as to defy description . He gives Brian Blessed a run for his money in the ' loudest man alive ' stakes . It comes as a relief when the end credits appear.Perhaps the timing was just wrong - bringing out a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea . Or the public simply had had enough of Jerry ( that beard probably did not help ! ) . What he needed here was a good producer , someone to take him in hand and say : " " That gag stinks . Throw it out ! " . " ' Don 't Raise The Bridge , Lower The River ' is a masterpiece by comparison with this picture.As the ' 70 's got underway , the new comedy icons would be Woody Allen , Mel Brooks , and Monty Python - fresher , more biting and in Allen 's case , more human styles of comedy replaced Jerry 's brand of slapstick . It would not be until 1982 that he would make anything like a successful comeback - as the conceited talk-show host ' Jerry Langford ' in Martin Scorcese 's brilliant ' The King Of Comedy ' . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie starts out promisingly , with an early scene in which Frank Morgan advises against Gary Cooper 's marriage to his daughter , Anita Louise . Frank Morgan , playing an unabashed gold-digger , loudly complains to Cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family - including his daughter , Anita Louise . I am a fan of all 3 actors . Frank Morgan is ( to my mind ) a Hollywood treasure , Cooper a legend , and Louise a very lovely , versatile and under-appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role . I also have nothing against Teresa Wright , and while not blessed with great range , she usually delivers heart-warming performances.From a promising opening , the story slides downhill all the way to the end . I found nothing humorous about burning down the home of Cooper 's would-be in-laws . The butler in such a fastidious , non-smoking household would never just blithely walk away , allowing Cooper to continue smoking , or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his ill-timed cigarette . Moreover , nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it . And finally , nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket ! This whole sequence just made Cooper seem foolish and gauche . It is a poor contrivance - ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter . The forced medical examination of Cooper is equally contrived . Nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent ! That Cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny - it 's absurd ! Stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense , and that , too , is nothing to laugh about . Finally , the scenes of Cooper 's overly fastidious , neurotic attention to his baby 's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies . But to me they just seem tedious and slow . The wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes , while paradoxically , the script writer went to sleep.The lines are just not in the script to generate humor . They just miss on all cylinders . The laughs come not a mile-a-minute , but more like a light year-a-minute . The only time the movie has any energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is on camera.The scene that is totally wasted is when both of Cooper 's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together . There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine , but none of it was extracted.In the end , one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt . Predictably , it is the Anita Louise character , who gets jilted on her would-be-wedding night ! While it is not on camera , that is her fate , and it is not particularly funny - even as a loose end . She hadn 't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic ( unlike Gail Patrick , say , in My Favorite Wife ) . Consequently , I was expecting ( perhaps " " hoping " " is a better word in the context of the film ! ) for Anita Louise to enjoy a happy ending , too . The fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie 's end really undermines the effect of the " " happy ending " " for Cooper and Wright.I kept waiting for something to happen , for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era ... And it never delivered . A good performance by Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Fool for Love " " is one of the several now forgotten films Robert Altman directed throughout the 1980s . This one , a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard play that features Shepard in the lead role , just simply isn 't very good . Altman made many not-very-good films over the course of his fascinating career , and many times the fault was his . But here I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a flimsy play . Altman 's direction is assured , the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work with , but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere , and takes its time getting there.Shepard is Eddie , a stuntman who has a love / hate relationship with May ( Kim Basinger ) . The two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere , while a mysterious man ( Harry Dean Stanton ) who may be either a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May quietly observes . Randy Quaid rounds out the four-person cast as a gentleman caller.The only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that Eddie 's and May 's relationship is incestuous . However , this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything . The screenplay doesn 't explore their relationship in any detail , and it doesn 't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes . Shepard and Basigner create eccentric , mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes ; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots . The last half hour or so of the film is especially bad , when Eddie 's and May 's back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone , somnolent voice over.Chalk this up to another of Altman 's experiments gone awry.Grade : C- , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This sequel to " " In the Heat of the Night " " will suffer in inevitable comparisons to its infinitely better predecessor . Instead of looking like a theatrical movie edited for television , " " Mister Tibbs " " looks suspiciously like a TV movie edited for theatrical release , with grainy photography , cheesy opening titles , and sets that look like they 're made of plywood . The murder sequence has a glaring continuity error : the camera shows two hands choking the girl , then a shot of a hand reaching for a statuette , then a shot of the girl being choked with two hands again , and finally the statuette coming down for the fatal blow . Solving the case should be easy : find the only guy with three hands ! But the shoddy production values can 't completely obscure this film 's considerable merits : namely , Sidney Poitier 's performance as the cool detective determined to follow the evidence wherever it may lead , even if it implicates a friend . Martin Landau is also convincing as the do-gooder preacher-activist suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute girlfriend . In addition to being haunted by the case , Tibbs is conflicted about his home life , but the issues of race and Tibbs ' barely concealed sense of social outrage are absent here . So is the complex murder mystery that made " " In the Heat of the Night " " so compelling . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There 's no denying the first Azumi film was a commercial product ; it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young , attractive actors and certainly wasn 't lacking in the budget department . Yet it more than entertained for what it was , and I can 't deny I enjoyed it immensely . " " Azumi 2 " " lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful . The first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm . With him , he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics , but the originals style , beauty and most importantly , its heart . While the first had a simple " " hitlist " " plot , this one has a corkscrew mess of a story , with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated . Gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters ; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of stroppy teenagers arguing in a forest . Characterisation is non existent ; if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies , I 'll be shocked . The same applies to the villains here . The final battle - in fact all the battles - are completely devoid of any sort of tension . The fact that they are poorly choreographed and abysmally directed - not to mention few and far between - is made a sideline by their own sheer pointlessness . The villains themselves try far too hard to be campy , and even if they were all combined , they don 't come within a country mile of the Pete Burnsian antics of Jo Odagiri in the original . # # # # Major Spoiler at end of paragraph ! # # # # # Aya Ueto tries her best it has to be said , and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films . Azumi is now a fully fledged assassin , meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion ; unfortunately , now the character is instilled with a sort of Man With No Name style mysteriousness , Ueto 's model looks become even more inappropriate . I know this is supposed to be the point , but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the film , the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptness of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around . The less said about Chiaki " " Remember me from Kill Bill " " Kuriyama 's performance the better ; it suffices to say her " " turn " " from good to evil is about as subtle as napalm.Overall , this was just a colossal disappointment . Any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film . A lazy , unsatisfying - and generally downright boring - mess . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This production doesn 't come near the level this material demands . The concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" sdiner82 had clearly not seen the film in decades , and his memory is appalling . His attempts to paint the Mark Lester shaving scene as suspect are utterly erroneous , as are his incorrect comments about the bad guy " " sneaking peeks at the kid 's body " . " Lester is clothed for the entire time the man is in the room , and the man barely gives him a glance.The scene is a crude attempt to show Lester 's innocent curiosity about the man 's body.Like everything in this film , it 's badly done , but nothing more.Even sdiner82 's comments about Savalas ' character who " " casually sent a German family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff " " is nonsense ( it was a single woman , she was already dead , and she was in a car ) .I suggest that sdiner82 's review says far , far more about his own , far from liberal mindset , than it does about this valueless film.The only reason I even bothered to look it up , was out of curiosity to see if it was made before or after Kojak.The film is a worthless piece of 70 's trash , but sdiner82 's review of it is the worst kind of slander . He wraps up his review in pseudo-intellectual " " facts " , " but the only fact is that he is plain wrong on almost every " " factual " " matter he discusses.I can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he looked for , which is disturbing .

" I think that most people would agree with me if I were to say that the movie Alien pretty much set the bar for atmosphere . I 've seen quite a few movies match that bar but none have ever exceeded Alien 's eerie tunnels and darkened halls . The Cave is a film that tries very hard to reset the bar . I believe the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as Alien yet not once throughout the movie did I ever feel even the slightest bit scared , or thrilled for that matter.So now that we got the ball of negativity rolling I might as well explain why the Cave 's main hook ( the atmosphere in case you weren 't paying attention ) fizzled into a waste of my time . I 'll say right now that most of the sets were gorgeous and nicely lit but what we hear and what we know is there tend to ruin what we see . The music for one is terrible . We either get corny rock music or over exaggerated haunted house music . Okay maybe that 's pushing it a bit but I couldn 't bear it . The many underwater scenes were bad enough ( it 's a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell ) I didn 't need rock music blaring in my ears while they were simply swimming through a cave . This actually produced a lot of unintentional laughter that was then amplified by the following watercraft crash scene.Anyway as I already mentioned , it wasn 't just the music that killed the atmosphere , heck no . The creatures hiding amongst the darkness are supposed to invoke horror . I 'm supposed to be worried that they are going to appear and merely a glimpse of them is supposed to make my blood turn cold . The Cave does wisely take a page from the alien handbook by not showing the entire creature for very long and leading up to the reveal with only glimpses but it just doesn 't work because the creatures are so lame . I guess it would be rude to spoil the specifics but they are basically the aliens with wings.I guess you get the point by now . Atmosphere ruined . Yet I know plenty of people who will still see a movie if it 's exciting . I 'd like to say that about the Cave but I 'd be lying . This movie is slow to get to the action and once we get there we sort of wonder when the thing is going to finally call it a day . We 've seen all this done better before with the exception of a few neat scenes ( the guy impaled on stalactites , the eel and the rapids ) so you really don 't get any thrills from watching people running from uninspired alien knockoffs in endless tunnels.Ah but no the pain doesn 't end there . We must also take the characters and acting into account . Well I can 't remember a single line of dialogue other than " " run ! " " and the only character 's name I can remember is Jack but that 's only because it 's placed in almost every other line near the end of the movie . Perhaps the actors were capable but the script didn 't allow them to do anything other then run and argue . They had almost no background and whenever somebody died they simply shrugged it off . It 's pretty sad when you consider that the CGI eel puts on the best performance in the film.Speaking of CGI ; there 's plenty of it , most of which is terrible . I do commend them on using suits ( at least I THINK they were suits ) but nothing truly meshes with the environment and as a result most of the effects end up looking pretty hokey.So I guess to wrap it up , the Cave is bad and has very little going for it . Had the film been a SciFi channel premiere movie or low budget direct to video release I might have a bit more love for it but this film was a theatrical release . With more wit and talent this might have been a frighteningly fun movie but as it stands this film is about as scary as going into the basement and that 's not very good.My review from Frider Waves : http : / / friderwaves.com / index.php ? page = cave , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I completely disagree with the previous reviewer : this movie has amusing moments but hardly a laugh riot . ( unless you really think sipping from a septic tank and heads exploding in a vice are a laugh riot ) In fact , the only reasons I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 are because a . ) two of the actors are decent b . ) the soundtrack is above average with some tuneful pop songs thrown in for contrast and c . ) the monster truck is pretty terrifying.Other than that , this is a movie with some intermittent , creepy or interesting ideas which are overwhelmed by unrelenting crassness , crudity and vileness . The former best friend character is one of the most annoying I 've ever seen and the small grace that the hitchhiker character had disappears in yet another contrived twist ending that makes little to no sense at all.A waste of the lead actor who shows some nervous charm and the aforementioned actress portraying the hitchhiking character ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Odious Chuck Norris decided to put one final nail in the coffincontaining his film career before going to the safe world of CBSSaturday night carnage with this hysterically bad supernaturalactioner.For such a dumb movie this thing sure is plotty . Norris is Chicagocop Frank Shatter . First off , what kind of last name is " " Shatter " " ? Have you ever met any Shatters ? Genforum.com has no listing forthe last name Shatter , which opens up any half clever viewer toreplace the " " a " " in Shatter with an " " i .

The demon 's scepter , from which he gets his power , is busted into nine pieces and hid in nine different parts of theworld by holy men . In 1951 , some grave robbers accidentally letProsatano out and he begins collecting the nine pieces . Hedisguises himself as an antiquities professor named Lockley andalways happens to be giving a lecture where a holy man is killedand a piece of the scepter is taken.Norris brings in his " " Walker : Texas Blunder " " cohort Sheree Wilson , who plays Lockley 's assistant . She helps Norris with hisinvestigation , they make goo goo eyes at each other , and ourintrepid investigators travel to Israel after a rabbi is killed inChicago . While in Israel , Calvin is given even more to complainabout : the heat , the lack of restaurant accomodations , the lousydrivers , and the fact that he is missing the Chicago Bulls playoffgames . Norris even manages to work a cute Israeli kid into thisnightmare . Bezi steals Calvin 's wallet , and hangs around the men , leading them around Israel and not arousing any sort ofappropriate suspicion.Eventually , Lockley ( Prosatano ) assembles all of the scepterpieces , but needs the blood of royalty to complete the ceremonyand call up the devil . Where to find royal blood ? Well , Sheree 'sfather is a duke ! She has an American accent but she is thescreenwriters ' convenient method of forcing this monstrositytoward its inevitable conclusion . Sure , this minion of Satan mayhave killed countless hundreds over the years , but how is hegonna do against a good old fashioned American butt kickin ' ? After Prosatano has been vanquished , killed by his own scepter ( Ienvied him , he did not have to watch Bezi steal Calvin 's walletagain ) , we are treated to an awful coda involving a bearded manwho has been watching Shutter , I mean Shatter , and Calvin ontheir quest . You see , it was foretold ... somewhere ... that twowarriors from the west would defeat Prosatano . The silentbearded man who watched over the couple was none other thanJesus ... I kid you not . He is listed as " " Prophet " " in the end credits , but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle Christianreference the film makers are trying to exhibit here.Like in " " I Use a Walker : Texas Ranger , " " Norris is aging and cannotget into his fight scenes too much anymore . He kicks a lot , andpeople fly over furniture in slow motion , and then Norris gives all ofhis line readings in that monotone voice of his . Oh , what a realdirector might be able to fashion out of him ! His brother , Aaron , who has directed him in other films as well , has no sense of storyor momentum . Scenes are thrown in for ego 's sake , not toentertain . The scenes when the dynamic duo first meet Bezi dragon and on , and then Bezi is not all that important to the rest of thefilm.The film was shot on location in Israel , which means theAmericans could insult the Israelis in person . There is not onelikeable Israeli character here . The Israeli police captain is a jerk.The cops ' driver does not know English , and Calvin convinces himthat the word " " sh * tty " " is a compliment . Nothing funnier thanmocking those stupid foreigners on their home turf , especiallywhen all this racist humor is coming from an American minoritywho would have been more than offended if the tables were turnedand the Israeli cop was mocking the African-American cop inChicago.This film is badly written , badly acted , and badly directed . It doesnot work as action , cop drama , or even horror . It just shows thatthe now defunct Cannon Studios was willing to throw their moneyinto anything , no matter how badly it was planned .

" With its few touches of surrealism , LWHTRB works as low-grade horror , but as a major follow-up statement to the original , it flounders miserably . Things begin somewhat promising during the telefilm 's opening credits ... We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds : The Baby 's black crib with the overhanging , inverted cross ; the kitchen knife Rosemary carried into the Castevette 's apartment and dropped in shock ( the utensil is shown sticking out of the hardwood floor ) ; and the emptiness of the Bramford itself , without tenants or furniture ( voice-overs can be heard here from the previous film 's dialog ) . Interesting too is the Easter Egg hunt the titular child participates in ( the eggs and baskets are also black ) . Once the story gets rolling , it never really ' rolls ' ...

Patty Duke ( a poor replacement for Mia Farrow ) , Ray Milland and Tina Louise ( as the Southwestern Whore who raises the child , " " Adrian / Andrew " " ) head this almost-star cast , with Ruth Gordon reprising her " " Minnie " " role.Although not a total failure , this sequel-of-sorts should have been released in book form first , then maybe we all could have been a bit better informed ... and not left totally in the dark .

" Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story . Bohemian Jean Seberg and her equally bohemian widower father David Niven holiday in the South of France with nutty Myl챔ne Demongeot . Things are fine until family friend Deborah Kerr shows up . Nivens , a degenerate womanizer , finds the conquest of Kerr too hard to resist . That 's fine with Seberg , as long as Niven loves her and leaves her ( as he 's done with all the women in his past ... including Demongeot ) . When it appears as though she 's becoming second banana in Niven 's life , Seberg exact revenge on Kerr . Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Seberg 's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes . The cinematography by Georges P챕rinal is stunning . The film features some of Preminger 's least heavy-handed direction , although he rarely allows any close-ups , which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling . Arthur Laurents wrote the script and it 's full of acidic dialog and funny scenes ( mostly involving bird-brained Demongeot ) . Seberg acquits herself fairly well , but Niven is at his least appealing ... and he shows no chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr . Preminger really mis-steps with that casting . It 's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to Charles Boyer . With Geoffrey Horne as Seberg 's would-be suitor and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother .

" I watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful ! Awfully long - even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life ! Awfully boring - the parts they included were long-winded , and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained ! Awfully inaccurate - the whole 'mystical ' side to this film was a joke , and last time I checked Ghengis Khan wasn 't exactly a nice guy ! Awfully acted - I found several of the characters hard to believe , they were very two-dimensional and lacked and kind of depth ! A saving grace of the film was the cinematography . That is why I gave this film a 2 star-rating rather than the bare minimum ! However , if you want to look at something pretty I would recommend buying a picture instead !

Let 's just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie . To call the acting one-dimensional would be giving them credit . What little there is , is atrocious to begin with , and made much worse by the terrible video and editing.The worst part of this atrocity , though , apart from the plot , would have to be the effects ... or rather the disturbing lack thereof . There are no blanks in the guns , no flashpots , and what few sound effects existed were either stock " " gun " " sounds , or they were generated by mouth ( yeah , you read that right ) . The filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a " " shh " " sound for the elevator doors ; I guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic . This is supposed to be set in the year 2031 , after all . That doesn 't explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist-fight scenes , however.If it wasn 't bad enough that the sound quality is terrible ( he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera , and it shows ) , the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all . The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a herd of sheep , and they 're just as clumsy . Picture this : The bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey . A lady starts to run in fear . He raises his gun ( an uzi ) , and shakes it . We hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi . The woman runs away from camera , and suddenly a single blood pack ( only 1 ) explodes on her back ( looked like she was hit by a paintball ) , and she falls flat on her face.Bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequence.In another sequence , one which almost- but not quite- makes the movie funny enough to watch , takes place in a stairwell . The bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he 's protecting down the stairs , shaking his plastic uzi all the way . You may wish to duck ; there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place.I supposed Alan DeHerrera can 't be locked away for conceiving of this train wreck , but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it . If there 's any justice , there 's bound to be some karma out there with his name on it.Should you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste- and I would strongly advise against it- be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly verbatim from Bladerunner , and the AM radio that doubles as a walkie-talkie . Try not to focus too hard on the plot ; it will only hurt you more if you do.0 stars of 10 . And that 's being generous . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Get Shorty " , " " " Out of Sight " , " " " Jackie Brown " " ( and even " " 52 Pick-Up " " ) --folks were finally getting Elmore Leonard right , making good movies out of his work . So , despite my students ' warnings about how bad this movie would be , I couldn 't resist renting it . I thought , How bad can it be ? Oy , what a mistake , especially right on the heels of reading the book , which was lame ( and too circularly self-referential , too ) relative to the rest of Elmore Leonard 's books . Still , the book was better than the movie . Leonard again trumps the weak and unskilled screen-writers who try to take over his book . The dialogue written for Steven Tyler was painful to watch . And the lyrics to the character Linda Moon 's first song ? My middle-schoolers write with more depth . Sad , sad , sad . Why even give it a star ? Because Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman are still fun to see on screen , and Andre 3000 didn 't make a complete fool of himself . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OH MY GOD ! After having such a promising start , Critters 2 reiterated the Karmic rule of what goes around comes around . Clearly , very few things were thought out when this movie was made , and what was up with Scott Grimes wearing an earing ! This should have been the last expedition into the Critters saga , but more garbage was on its way . This was the big reason why I didn 't watch Critters 3 , and why is every bad film series has to have an episode in space ?

" I am a gigantic fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi , but this movie is just not good . The reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the Detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film . I really , really wish I had left after that , instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film . Maybe my expectations were too high , but I felt let down.The score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you 're a fan , but there 's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh . It was good enough , though , that I 'll still probably check out the soundtrack.But just keep this in mind if you see this film : if you come to realize at any point that you 're not enjoying it , go ahead and split - you won 't miss a thing , because it won 't get any better.I 'll even give the executive summary here ( warning ! spoilers ! ) : lots of shots of athletes that look almost good enough for a Nike commercial , shots of smiling people , inexplicably dull frontal head shots of famous people 's wax dummies ( WTF were they thinking here ? ! ? ) , some giggling babies ( cuuuuute ) , some " " bitchin ' " " Photoshop effects , some imagery that 's meant to suggest a comparison between the flows of water , information , money and people ( I think ) ... and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence ... and then a bunch of stock space footage.I could remake this movie in 10 seconds . Here 's my pitch : 2 seconds of a happy daddy with a shaved head and lycra biking shorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with string ; 5 seconds of that scene in " " Network " " where the guy talks about messing with the " " elemental forces of nature " " and how " " money flows in , money flows out ; " " 1 second of Reginald Denny getting brained with a brick , and then 3 seconds of Alan Bean bouncing around on the moon . There you go - that 's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life I just saved . Of course , I 'd get a copy of After Effects and apply a filter or two , so it wouldn 't look as blatantly stock as it is . If Steven Soderbergh 's reading this , hey , I won 't even need much money for this project ... If you insist upon watching a movie about " " Life as War , " " I suggest " " Bowling for Columbine " " instead . It may not have the pseudo-intellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd , but at least it 's funny . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is your typical Priyadarshan movie--a bunch of loony characters out on some silly mission . His signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money . Whether it is a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly , black money in Hera Pheri , " " kodokoo " " in Phir Hera Pheri , etc . , etc . , the director is becoming ridiculously predictable . Don 't get me wrong ; as clich챕d and preposterous his movies may be , I usually end up enjoying the comedy . However , in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor , ( Hungama and Hera Pheri being noteworthy ones ) . Now , the hilarity of his films is fading as he is using the same formula over and over again.Songs are good . Tanushree Datta looks awesome . Rajpal Yadav is irritating , and Tusshar is not a whole lot better . Kunal Khemu is OK , and Sharman Joshi is the best . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I read the novel ' Jane Eyre ' for the first time back in 1986 . It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke . It was an excellent version and very much like the book . Years later , I laid eyes on this version and was horrified . William Hurt is totally miscast as Mr Rochester . Mr Rochester is a passionate character , where as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice . The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough . It was like watching two zombies together . This is story about love and passion , but I couldn 't see it in this version . No , back to the BBC-version . A wonderful time is guaranteed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is probably the worst movie ever made it is just to bad the name of Roger Corman is associated with it .

" If you read my review of SyFy 's " " Dinoshark " , " you know that I can appreciate the low-budget schlock that these made-for-television movies can provide . They 're stupid ... they 're silly ... but they 're still pretty fun in a " " so bad , it 's good " " kind of way . So , still smacking with guilt for liking ( and recommending ) the undeniably hokey " " Dinoshark " , " I sat down to watch " " Hammerhead : Shark Frenzy " , " a SyFy Original Movie about a half-man , half-hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island . With the SyFy Channel 's sure-fire recipe for creating B-movie creature features and a cast that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo , how could it possibly go wrong ? Well , to my surprise , it actually misses the mark ... not by much , but enough to make me not recommend it . Why ? Well , first of all , its titular monster , the dreaded hammerhead-human hybrid , takes a backseat to a bunch of faux-military thugs who really become the movie 's primary villain . Though the hammerhead does rack up the body count , he ( or it or whatever you call the thing ) only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after . The rest of the movie is filler , pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers . That , to me , is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people !

" This movie reminds me of Harry Potter - not the style but the marketing strategy . There may be part 2 , part three ... until one day the product life cycle finishs , of course on the condition that the part one has a commercial success. so many things seems to be hidden and thus the story looks quite incomplete. the action design is boring. set design is ok but not fine. perhaps Edison Chen would be a big star one day . He really looks charming even on big screen . The most impressive is still Anthony Wong . 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm writing this because I somehow felt being led to believe Dark Remains was a good movie . Whilst it 's not the worst I 've seen , it certainly isn 't good.A Weak script , weak actors , and weak directing . Even if they can 't afford big name cast , would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress ? It was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance . The story was a clich챕 and poorly scripted . The special effects were minimal . The " " suspense " " tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow.To be fair , Dark Remains is no worse than quite some of the Masters of Horrors ' episodes . But not quite on par with quality movies yet . Dark Remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don 't want to miss any movie in the genre , even if it 's a poorly made one . As for anyone else , time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but , wow , did it turn corny , or should I say , " " just plain stupid . " " This is just another example of outdated humor . It might have been funny in 1940 , but not now .... not even close.Dick Powell is always interesting to watch . I especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the Busby Berkeley musicals to where he 's mature and sounds it , too.He was fine as " " Jimmy MacDonald , " " but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters , the worst being the boss ( Raymond Walburn ) of the Maxford House Coffee Company , who did nothing but shout all the time . He was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The psychology of this movie is really weird to try and figure out . Its often billed as an anti-RPG movie , but its really not that simple . Here are come apparent contradictions that make me wonder just what ( if anything ) they 're trying to say about gaming.They laboriously introduce all the characters home lives by way of introduction , all of them having parents who are divorced , alcoholic , and totally out of touch with their lives except for the times they 're harshly pressuring them to succeed . Tom Hanks is arguably the worst off , having just failed out of another school and still dealing with a brother who disappeared and may be dead . Its mentioned a couple of times that they play the game to work through problems in their real lives . And sure enough , at the end , when they go to see Robbie ( Hanks ) , they 're all happy and well-adjusted , embarking on their adult careers , problems solved , games put away ( Daniel doesn 't even want to design computer games any more ) , and even Robbie 's mother , who 's been constantly drunk and dissatisfied , is suddenly the Happy Homemaker , looking fresh and bright and arranging flowers . Sure , JJ suddenly ( and quite cheerfully it seems ) decides to commit suicide , but the reason seems to be entirely because he 's a lonely boy genius who can 't get a date , and not because his character dies , as in the famous Jack Chick tract ( which happens afterward anyways , and it almost seems like he does it on purpose so he can end Daniels game and get everyone to come play his . In fact , the prospect of live-action role playing in the caverns seems to be the only thing that saves him from killing himself ! ) And in what may be the coolest tableau scene in the whole movie , Kate , looking very fetching in chain mail , looks right at the camera and says something like , " " The scariest monsters are the ones in our own minds . " " The biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two muggers passing up the rich couple so they can rob the dirty , homeless-looking guy of his magic beans . The recurring theme ( a " " The Way We Were " " for the 80s ) might have been poignant at the end , but as a way to kick off a movie is downright depressing and seems out of place . And for one final mystery , our hero , wearing full Pardu regalia , has a psychotic break , becomes his character completely and embarks on his quest , so of course the first thing he does is change into 20-century street clothes . So maybe the movie 's irrational , but I guess its dealing with an irrational topic . In those days a circle of kids with dice and pencils was regarded as tainted and possibly possessed , and you could go insane if they spoke their mumbo-jumbo at you . The anti-game paranoia is pretty much summed up in the first scene , where the reporter asks the cop whats going on , the cop says a kids lost in the tunnels and there 's a chance Mazes and Monsters is somehow involved . The reporter admits to being vaguely familiar with the game ( although he allows his own children to play it ) , then turns to the camera and reels off a polished spiel that blames the game for everything and admits no possibility of another explanation . In the end , its no masterpiece , but interesting as made-for-TV movies go . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I wasn 't really fond of the first " " Cube " " movie . It was a good idea , but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much . Didn 't really feel the need to see its sequel but when I heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original . I was intrigued , thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original 's problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters . Well I thought wrong . " " Cube Zero " " starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never-ending maze of traps that plagues the people in the Cube . The filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men 's daily routine . Several questions are created from it , concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation . All of which are left entirely to the viewer . The acting was a bit weak but all in all the movie 's first half moved relatively well.With the story moving on , one of the two " " watchers " " begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing . And later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped . Here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese.Sent by the people who run the Cube program we are introduced to the character " " Jax " . " Along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure . To start of " " Jax " " looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a James Bond movie complete with the ever " " popular " " glass eye , that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first half 's relatively nice pace . Whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie . With some incredibly corny lines , perhaps the screenwriter got bored and didn 't care . The acting itself degrades to a further low when the former " " watcher " " meets the group in the Cube . The entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it.Again failing to impress on anything but weak characters , dialog and acting " " Cube Zero " " is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie .. I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny . I felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience , but honestly the plot to this movie needed MAJOR revision .. it didn 't even make sense , one second the characters question what exactly it is that they 're snorting .. the next scene they 're hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it ? ? Also the ending just took the cake .. I 'm not going to spoil the magnificent conclusion .. but it pretty much blended right in with the rest of the horrible plot / script ... see this movie for comedy if you must .. , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" For a fan series , I must admit that Hidden Frontier is not at all that bad . But , reviewing this series can not be based on whether it is a fan series or not . The initiative in itself is commendable . The creativity as well . I reckon these are people with ordinary jobs , and a big enthusiastic heart for Star Trek . But , doing all this work . Pulling all these resources . Taking all this time , and still all those flaws.First of all the acting , and the lines are awful . For most . The dialogs belongs in a 70 's military show , not in Star Trek . The captain ( Mr Squinty ) looks like he is about to burst into laughter anytime . And most characters are just reading their lines . The directors should be aware of the fact that " " retake " " is not just a word in the dictionary . But I also guess that the series are made in the manner of " " Two Takes Frakes " , " who directed many of the TNG episodes and movies Also , I could not help but think that most of the actors are typical Trekkies . Without going any deeper into that assumption.My biggest concern regarding the whole project , is the quality of the releases . When they first decided to spend so much time , and resources on this series - why didn 't they make it available in decent quality ? Using the quick time format , with low low resolution is a waste of talent . Even the " " higres " " episodes is considered bad quality compared to the standard quality series are released in . Using Xvid codec , with a larger resolution and file size would have improved the experience massively . If band with problems was the issue , setting up a torrent tracker would have solved that.Let 's hope the crew decides to brush the series up , and perhaps release it on DVD , giving it the quality the project deserves . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Wagons East " " was a big disappointment for me . But the saddest thing about this movie is that it turned out to be John Candy 's last film role ( he died just before shooting was completed on this ) . There are only a few laughs throughout this western spoof , and for a comedy that doesn 't cut it . If you want to see a uproarious spoof of western movies , the answer is obvious . See Mel Brooks ' classic " " Blazing Saddles " . " Or if you want to see Candy in much better material , see " " Summer Rental " , " " " Spaceballs " , " or " " Uncle Buck " " ( just to name a few ) .

" It seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence . In fact violence , both disturbing and cartoonish , is the last of " " Oldboy " " ' s deep flaws . The characters are unidimensional , underdeveloped , primitive . The " " intensity " , " an obsession and a goal in itself with this director , is served up with the cheapest of means . Let 's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth . By the end of the movie , it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of " " horror " , " to continue to " " shock " " an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap-opera " " revelations " " already served up in big bunches . It would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash .

" Now this film isn 't going to scare anyone , but it was interesting for two reasons - two big reason and a smaller one- well , that 's three reasons , isn 't it.The first reason this is interesting is the special effects . I found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular . To see the hair growing on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was creepy , especially when they were participating in a m챕nage 횪 trois.Of interest , is the fact that this Marsha Hunt is the famous " " Brown Sugar " " of the Rolling Stones song , and that she was in the infamous nude scene in the London cast of the rock musical Hair.Besides the special effects , there were two other points of note in this film , and they were brought out repeatedly during the closing credits . I lost count , but i swear that Sybil Danning bared those points for us in the closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more .

" Where to begin ? How best to describe just how awful this movie is ? ? ? Let 's start with the campy hick humor . It isn 't very funny . Add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse . Pity poor Art Carney , who should have known better than to do this movie.And then there is the plot . A roadie whose life goal is to work an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper . At least they get what they want ... And then , just when the movie should end , they can 't come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well , I won 't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie.There are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a " " B " " movie or perhaps worse . Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role . That 's a sure sign that the movie probably won 't be very good . If nothing else , the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeds them by being worse than poor.Let 's just say this . This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared .

" Glenn Ford , a New York boy who has been saving his cash , thumbs and hobos his way to the Arizona ranch he has bought , where he hopes to find HEAVEN WITH A BARBED WIRE FENCE.A film with a Dalton Trumbo script and story , directed by villain extraordinaire Ricardo Cortez , and starring the frequently twitchy Glenn Ford and the restless Richard Conte just shouldn 't be so bloody nice . Though the system -- mostly seen as mean cops and railroad bulls and real estate con men -- is as awful as one might expect from the leftish Mr. Trumbo , every single proletarian is just so sweet and nice and salt of the earth that one feels nausea . It doesn 't help that the heroine -- a sweet blonde thing who is an illegal alien refugee fleeing Franco 's Spain -- is annoying for reasons of both scripting and acting.So why watch ? Richard Conte , in his first role , already has his persona and a pretty good part . And there are some moments of 30s leftist camp that are pretty astonishing . ( Did Dalton absolutely have to set a major portion of the movie in the Russian Worker 's mission ? All that was missing was a portrait of a beaming Joe Stalin ! ) Also , this is Glenn Ford 's first substantive role ( though his performance isn 't good ) .Why not watch ? Essentially , the movie offers an unconvincing vision , is wedded to a political viewpoint that is risible , and the two leads have made much better movies . Also , the strengths of Dalton Trumbo as a screenwriter are nowhere in evidence . Instead , we get a film that the Coen Brothers Barton Fink could have written in a flash ( and avoided that hellish bout with writer 's block ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Think of this film as fan service , a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer . We start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film . Flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins : The virginal Mandy Lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school , and gets invited to spend a weekend at a ranch by three guys who think they can get lucky , and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size . So .. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night , who want to do nothing but have sex , do drugs and drink booze . The only other company is a hunky ranch-hand who may or may not be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome . Hmm ... potential future suspect maybe ? So as you 're probably ascertained by now , all the house-guests end up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways , and for a change the black man ISN 'T the first to die . There are some conventions that still hold up though , like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field . Or the lights going out mysteriously in the evening as our ' heroes ' unwisely separate to tackle the problem . Even down to the so-called shocking twist at the end , the movie is like an old 80 's horror updated for the noughties , and on this score it succeeds.Unfortunately , it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too , namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise . People get cut up , shot , bludgeoned etc but because of their innate hatefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations , it 's hard to care as the bodies stack up . Someone gets murdered , one of their friends goes out to look for them alone , BANG they 're brown bread . Rinse , then repeat . Maybe one day we 'll get a screenplay with plausible , intelligent , likable characters who make rational decisions but still end up being outwitted by a genius killer . Until then , we have to tolerate teenagers with the I.Q of pond-life being picked off by a deranged hoodie . Oh well .. 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was not old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad , but I knew everyone thought it was cool . I have some of the " " books " " that were written based on the series in my screen-to-print collection , and they 're pretty light duty , so I didn 't expect much from the movie . That 's a good thing , because this movie was bad on a long leash . I admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the 1960 's hit . The movie audience , though , has gained sophistication in 30 years . At least , I think so . I certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original Mod Squad concept , with ( now old ) car chases , ( now considered poor ) camera work , ( tinny sounding ) soundtrack and ( poor ) script and all , on the big screen . In the 1960s , we didn 't care as much because we had minimal expectations . An integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough . It was that , another thrilling episode of " " Ironsides " " or " " Password . " " Rating this " " episode " " against usual theatre releases , the story was ... well , I 'm not sure I should even say because I 'm not sure there was one . Drugs are bad ? Whatever . The script was silly . When the characters are exchanging dialog and advancing the plot with lines like " " I overheard him say so on the phone , " " and " " I think I got a plan , " " we really are in trouble . No wonder the acting was dreadful : no one knew how to say such idiotic lines.If I were Claire Danes , I 'd be going after my agent with a flame-thrower right now . ( Actually , I think everyone in and watching the film has a right to seek retribution . ) And where was the Mod in that Squad ? I realize these kids just got out of juvenile hall , but no one had a velvet suit ? " " Mod " " only meant young and integrated ? What happened to white go-go boots ? Perhaps the costume department was going for gritty , but all they got was dirty and dingy.Since the movie was completely true to the original series , and required special behavior from the actors , cameramen , stunt men , etc . , we should appreciate it more . Unfortunately , I still don 't like it . If I wanted to watch 60 's crime drama , I 'd buy DVDs . No thanks . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" While not as bad as it has been made to be ( I have seen MUCH worse ) , this is still a very lame movie . Basically a rehash of Siegel 's " " Coogan 's Bluff " , " with the main difference being that Clint Eastwood 's hat has more charisma than the whole of Joe Don Baker , an unappealing actor if there was one.However , Venantino Venantini is great ( and great fun ) as the bad guy , sort of a budget Vittorio Gassman . He is the main reason to sit through this steampile , as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting , specially the girl . Poor old Rossano Brazzi , hard to believe he was once a romantic lead ( watch " " Mondo Cane " " to see him running away from women ) . Looking here like a second-tier Ben Gazzara , he 's given next to nothing to do . It 's all Joe Don 's show , unfortunately . And all of it scored to generic 80 's " " action movie " " music that couldn 't be more boring.Greydon Clark can make good B-Movies ( " " Without Warning " " ) , but here he trips , falls , breaks his nose and loses three teeth . Well , at least the Malta locations were nice , and there 's Venantini to try to save the day . 3 / 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Film critics of the world , I apologize . It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on . But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt . However , my decision to see " " The Cat in the Hat " " wasn 't made haphazardly . You see , three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the " " calamity " " known as " " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " . " Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful , funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat . So when the critics unleashed their fury against " " The Cat in the Hat " , " another big budget Seuss update with a big name star in the title role , I thought that it must be the same old song . How wrong I was.For five whole minutes I thought I was in the clear . The opening credits are clever , the kids are charming and the production values are top notch . Then the cat showed up . There are many problems from this point on , but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of Mike Myers . Where " " The Grinch " " was saved by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey , " " The Cat " " was destroyed by Myers . He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong , comic sketches . Every movie he 's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch , from " " Wayne 's World " " to " " Austin Powers " . " So he tries to do the same thing here , it 's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of SNL , not funny , just painful . Not that the writers helped him out any . After the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags , poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor . This movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience I have ever had . Period . So much talent and work went into something so vile . I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess , I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies . If you are a parent , please avoid this like the plague . With movies like " " Elf " " and " " Brother Bear " " currently in theaters , you have far better choices . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
I was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it to be complete and utter rubbish . Akerman 's direction is both heavy handed and cliched ( how much more cliched can you get than Paris at night ? ) . The male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to Egon Schiele 's angst ridden self portraits . Yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored . What is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish . The only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good Goddard and Truffaut really are . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Err ... this movie sucked . A LOT.I have been reading some of the other reviews . Apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything Woody Allen writes or stars in is automatically good ... I have watched several of his films , in the vain hope that I 'm missing something . But no , they just suck . Poorly written trash . The characters are all very stereotypical ( not to mention rather stupid ) . The plot is ... I think it is supposed to be mysterious . Not sure on that . Mr. Allen 's character is ... Woody Allen , on any other film you have seen of his.If you are a fan of Woody Allen , go see this film . If you are under 50 , don 't bother .

" If you 're in the mood to laugh at a truly bad movie ( bad in the way only Ken Russell at his worst can be ) , you must try this one . It succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a .25 porn-booth , and you can just about smell the urine on the floor . Kathleen Turner struts around in a blond wig , getting her kicks from " " pretending " " to be a two-bit hooker ( she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect ) , and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical " " priest " " who is out to maybe murderer her ( yet another movie that ends with Tony Perkins in drag ) . Annie Potts shows up and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit , which is reason enough to hate this movie .

" Peter Sellers ( one of my favorite actors ) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey , but the script is so lame and insulting that even Goldie Hawn 's youth ( just after her Oscar win ) cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud .

Nicky Henson plays a young study type.I hope Hawn and Sellers were paid well , because I see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 ( a very good year for films - CATCH-22 , M.A.S.H. , HUSBANDS , JOE , WUSA , FIVE EASY PIECES and many others ) .

" What is interesting is that the acting ; was not bad , just not enough . It was rather lame . , special effects nor the lines were the single culprit for this failure . Standing alone they weren 't horribly bad , but put together was a tragic move . The show seemed long winded and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along , but it failed totally.Much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects.Don 't believe it , they were kinda cool . Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor . Though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan recogniton .

I 'm not even sure that the history is even very close . They did very little to show why the Texans and Comanche fought against each other.The only good part about this movie was Zhan who played Gus very very well and is a great actor .

" I jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted , remembering rahs and raves for it . But wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary , it backed off and went somewhere else . The dripping water throughout the house , the black rain , the prophetic dreams , taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream.What a disappointment . Chamberlain 's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief , something I found myself mirroring as the film wore on . What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one 's head . The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods , that the Aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests , and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension ( the Dream Time ) . [ SPOILER ] In the final scene , it wasn 't clear to me what the director was trying to tell . Is there a big wave ? So what ? How big ? A tsunami ? Yeah , okay . That 's devastating but not apocalyptic . Is it the end of the world ? From a wave ? The last wave ? That 'd have to be a pretty darn big wave . Why ? Was the world that bad a place ? It didn 't seem so awful in this movie . Actually I didn 't think the wave came off , since the shadow left Burton 's face that had been cast by the wave . Was it only Burton 's apocalypse ? Heck , that happens every day to people who lose it . It wasn 't of any interest if it was only him.The most frightening scene , and the one that gives the best indication of Weir 's potential , was in Charlie 's apartment where Burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring Burton 's wife . Charlie keeps asking him " " Who are you ? " " and it becomes truly disturbing after a while . Unfortunately , the movie never followed suit . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

When I saw this , ( mostly out of a morbid curiosity ) I actually found myself criticizing it because of the fact that it was untrue to the book , even though this is a book that its impossible to make a good movie of . I figured at least if they 're going to make a film adaptation of the worst book I 've ever read the filmmakers might as well be accurate . They turned the guy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother , for some reason that bothered me most of all ( even though I seriously doubt keeping it a guy and his chick wouldn 't have made it any better ) .

" Michael Caine usually appears in either very good ( " " Blame It On Rio " , " " " Sleuth " , " " " Without A Clue " , " " " Gambit " , " " " Dirty Rotten Scoundrels " " ) or truly bad comedies ( " " Noises Off " , " " " Death Becomes Her " , " " " Harry & Walter Go To NY " " ) . This falls into the latter category.TA is a comedy that succeeds in only two things : managing to waste a cast that includes Caine , Gambon and Richardson , all of which have comedic abilities , and succeeding in its mission not to make the viewer laugh . There isn 't a single truly funny moment here . The main reason is the lousy script ; there was so much futile effort put into writing a pointlessly convoluted story which is simply too bothersome to follow ( considering it 's only a comedy ) that the writer ( s ) forgot to make the damn thing funny , which , as far as I can recall , is what the whole point of a comedy is supposed to be.I 've never seen this Moron before . Some people even say " " if you 're a Moron fan you 'll love this " " bla bla bla . A Moron fan ? Does this non-descript person really have fans ? A comedy as badly written as this requires a mega-talent to eke out a laugh or two out of it , someone like Steve Coogan and not your average Moron.If you 're going to make a comedy about actors then at least make them out to be the utter morons that they usually are . The characters of Caine and Moron are insufficiently dumb.The single most annoying thing about this unfunny collection of scenes is the little girl . Only a truly horrible writer would think that to spice up a lousy script it 's wise to include a super-intelligent wise-ass kid . Smart-a * * kids aren 't even funny to Bill Cosby fans any more . In " " Little Miss Sunshine " " we had a totally normal kid and she was very funny .

" I hope the viewer who regards ' Dream Machine ' as one of Corey Haim 's finest and the " " best movies of the century " " was kidding . Undetected sarcasm on my part ? I sincerely hope so . ' The Dream Machine ' marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of Corey Haim 's career ( except ' Prayer of the Rollerboys ' which was surprisingly decent ) . Here , Haim plays nonchalant college boy , Bernie , who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girl 's attention . Lucky for Bernie , a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband , hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tuner--Bernie--with a gift : a slick Porsche Turbo . However , unbeknownst to the woman , and unfortunate for Bernie , is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk . Now , being that in this movie , bodies don 't seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk , Bernie is unaware of this . In fact , the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise . In particular , a grizzly man follows him around , desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetected.This is a low-grade action fizzle as many of Haim 's films like this are ( see The Double O Kid ) . Despite being part action , part romantic comedy , this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty-five minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem ( i.e. Bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body , and a hit-man finding out that the Porsche is going to be hard to find ) . After which , and thanks to poor acting by Haim ( I loved this kid , too , but it 's not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously couldn 't act well ) and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between Bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result , inappreciable . To add injury to insult , the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self-evident songs you would hear in Team America ( see the ' date ' montage ) .Loyal Corey Haim fans , however , should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance . However , others understanding that Haim 's career probably peaked when he was 14 or 15 and never recovered , might expect mediocrity , as will viewers just looking for early 90s b-comedy fluff to pass the time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I also noticed that it won Best Actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic . It just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film-making and get it right before spreading himself too thin . The music was pretty ordinary . The story really didn 't go anywhere . It was just a sequence of fights strung together with poor script and cheesy dialogue.I will say this to all aspiring filmmakers though . Watch this film .

" I have never posted a review before , but I had to do it for this film ! This film is SO bad , I found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody . But it ISN 'T . It is truly , un-self-consciously BAD . This is a serious attempt that flops gloriously . Other reviewers have pointed out the film 's many flaws , so I 'll try not to repeat these , but I do urge you to see this film . Throughout it I was either speechless , literally gasping with disbelief , or rolling on the floor in hysterics . I haven 't had so much fun watching a film in years . In fact , I 'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it 's the kind of movie that needs to be shared.My favorite parts : -- When Arthur auditions to be a go-go boy ( his dancing is unbelievable ) -- The gratuitous nudity ( the director / leading actor just had to get a nude shot in ) -- The preacher 's office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of Christ -- Of course , the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings ( what narrative function does this play ? ! ? ) -- The ex-wife 's wrestling match with Ben to get possession of her gun -- The detailed sequence wherein Arthur kills the preacher ; he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match -- Yes , the gay religious-fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo fashions -- And , my favorite , the use of Joplin 's " " The Entertainer " " as the opening soundtrack and " " Pachebel 's Canon in D Major " " as the closing soundtrack ! -- the list goes on and on -- a MUST SEE ! ! ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

About an hour and a half later I remembered my resolve and was so happy that I hadn 't done that .

" " " The Core " " meets " " Crack in the World " " ( 1965 made for TV ) . The acting is stock , the suspense predictable . Once you subtract all of the plot ripped off from " " The Core " " - basically the manned drilling machine - you end up with the plot of " " Crack in the World " .

" I first read about the Left Behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to check it out since I have an interest in the way religion is used to control people in our ever more hate filled world , so imagine my surprise and joy when I found a copy of Left Behind : World at War in my local library , nestling innocently among the big budget action movies.Now as a movie it 's extremely poor . The acting is straight out of an elementary school production and the " " special effects " " would have looked dated in the early 90 's . Being the third part of a series the story would be unintelligible to anyone who hadn 't seen or read about the other Left Behind movies , and even with my prior knowledge it was still pretty laughable.On the religious front , I don 't think anyone who wasn 't already filled with the spirit of the lord would find anything in the movie to convince them to change their ways . How are you supposed to fear the Antichrist when he 's got a comedy Russian accent , and the worst of his powers are some pitiful CGI ? However , my main problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to try and dupe people into believing that it 's a big budget action movie . Upon picking up the box and reading the spiel I immediately noticed something odd ... nowhere on the packaging was there a mention of the true nature of this film . To someone not in the know it would appear for all intents and purposed that Left Behind : World at War was no different from the latest Tom Clancey . Nor , on the copy that I rented did it say anything about it being the third in a series.Considering the whole premise of the series is that the Antichrist has deceived the whole world , I find it extremely hypocritical that the film makers tried to deceive me TWICE before I even got the to counter ! If you 're so firm in your beliefs then why not be honest about it ? The simple fact is , had this not been a " " Christian " " movie with the built in fan base that goes with it , I seriously doubt it would ever have seen the light of day . If Cloud Ten were hoping that I 'd see the error of my ways and give myself to God , I 'm afraid to say I would have died of boredom and / or laughed myself to death before I ever had the chance . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Celia Johnson is good as the Nurse . Michael Hordern is good as Capulet , though it 's his usual neighing and whinnying and not a patch on his King Lear .

" " " The Vindicator " " is a weird little Canadian B-Movie .

Coincidence ? Who knows ?

Carl 's got a loving wife at home and a baby on the way , which makes it all the more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a " " lab accident . " " But wait ! Carl 's not really dead after all ! Whyte has extracted Carl 's brain and inserted it into his pet project , some sort of experimental bio-mechanical space suit . When Carl wakes up inside his new body , he understandably goes a little nuts , trashes the lab , and escapes . This is a problem because Whyte ( for reasons known only to himself ) has programmed the mechanical suit with a " " Rage Reaction " " program , which will cause Carl to kill anybody who touches him for any reason . In hindsight , that little addition to Carl 's psyche was probably not the best idea.So Robo-Carl wanders aimlessly through the movie for a while , killing a couple of random muggers and other assorted background characters , till he returns to his home and contacts his wife ( this scene is supposed to be heartbreakingly touching , I guess , but turns out comical because Carl 's robot voice is so heavily synthesized that you can barely understand a word he says ) . He of course tells her to leave the city and never come back because she 's in danger , but she wants to stay and help him , yadda yadda yadda . Eventually Whyte hires a gang of commando thugs led by " " Hunter , " " an apparent ninja assassin played by Pam Grier ( ! ) to hunt down and destroy his runaway creation , using Carl 's wife as bait , and predictable ( but laughably cheap looking ) mayhem ensues.I 'm a B-Movie kind of guy but " " The Vindicator " " was so half-assed that it turned into high comedy pretty quickly . I 'm assuming that a good hunk of the budget went into Stan Winston 's robo-Carl suit design , because that actually looks pretty cool , but the rest of the movie suffers from a cheap , made-for-TV kind of look . The script could 've used a LOT more work , but then maybe the filmmakers had gotten wind of " " RoboCop " " going into production and rushed to get " " Vindicator " " out so they couldn 't be accused of ripping them off . Either way , judging by the other comments here on IMDb , I 'm not the only one who 's noticed the parallels between " " Vindicator " " and " " RoboCop , " " and obviously " " Robo " " is the superior film , so there 's no need to waste your time sitting through this piece of nonsense unless you want to see a film that can best be described , at best , as a rough draft of " " RoboCop " " if it were made by an 8th grader . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... OR MAYBE NOT . THE WARNING IS THE SAME FOR ALL * Dang it . Just when I thought that SCIFI Channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies , they give us THIS . Actually , the plot itself it 's nothing we haven 't seen in movies like Snakes On A Plane , Deep Blue Sea , etc ... That means , a monster / animal / menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people . In this case , an alien in a train . Wow.I must say that , when I first saw this thing on cable , I couldn 't stop laughing . No SCIFI film had prepared me for this ; it was so incredibly pathetic I couldn 't believe it ! The actors are all a bunch of stereotypical-genre characters . But since they 're not so famous ( to say the least ) , I wasn 't expecting much of them . Except Diamond Phillips . No comments there , but I think the guy was desperate to find a job . The problem was something called ' special effects ' , horrible even for SCIFI Channel standards . That model / toy they made us believe it was a real train ( not to mention the model / toy helicopter , bigger than a train 's wagon ) , the meteor coming HORIZONTALLY from space , the ' baby ' alien ( a sock puppet , and I ain 't kiddin ' ) , the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly ... while they were static ; when they started " " moving " , " it was awful , the explosions ( the terrorist blew up LITERALLY ! And what about the exploding helicopter ! Just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying ? ) , the insane mathematics used ( they couldn 't even solve a school problem right ! ) ... And I won 't talk about that doomsday-like ending , by that time I didn 't know if to keep laughing or to start crying . If I remember right , I did both.It 's an ideal movie to have a good laugh , alone or with friends . But be warned ; it 's so ridiculous at SO MANY levels ... and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Oh what a disappointment this movie is . I can 't believe it was directed by Wajda . There 's practically no plot and 90 % of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen , weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre . The most interesting part comes right at the end , but by that time I simply stopped caring while trying to suppress my yawns.Almost the entire movie is filmed with a hand-held camera , which is supposed to convey the feeling of " " personal immediacy " " but there 's nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie . Instead , the constant jerking of the camera made me seasick . To be fair , there are some great shots too ( no pun intended ) , but nothing that makes you go " " Wow ! " . " If you 're not familiar with the Katyn massacre , the movie will leave you scratching your head . If you are familiar , you 'll be scratching your head too , although maybe for different reasons . Basically , the movie states and restates over and over again that it was the Soviets who murdered thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940 . This point is hammered repeatedly as though someone in the audience needed to be convinced of this basic historical fact . However , the movie never tries to explain as to WHY they were killed . After all , tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in the other Soviet POW camps were not harmed and were released in 1941 . It is also never explained adequately HOW MANY people perished , although the figure 20,000 is thrown in a couple of times.The acting is adequate with only Komorowska ( old woman ) and Chyra ( Lt. Jerzy ) giving noticeable performances , but they get to act for maybe 10-15 minutes in total . Certainly not enough to carry the whole movie . Many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their matin챕e looks rather than their acting abilities , but I won 't mention their names . Suffice to say that they are definitely NOT the Oscar material , so any claims that this movie was " " robbed " " of the Academy Award are simply laughable.The tone of movie is wrong as well . On one hand it tries to be an accurate historical drama , on the other it resorts to cheap anti-Soviet propaganda such as showing a Russian soldier tear up the Polish flag and using it to clean his boots . Then there are some puzzling scenes which have absolutely no bearing on the plot , such as a couple climbing on a roof or the liquidation of the Krakow University.There are many missed opportunities to make this movie more interesting , such as adding a political angle to the story , or showing the German discovery of the graves , or even portraying Anna 's trip from the Soviet occupied part to the German occupied Krakow . All of these aspects could have been the major part of the movie , but instead they 're reduced to a couple of minutes . In the end , we get a collection of loosely fitting , confusing , boring scenes about the reaction of Poles to one of their greatest tragedies of WWII . Not very compelling and not worthy of Wajda at all . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A trooper is on the side of the road making sure every1 is obeying the speed limit ( doing his job ) ; he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother ( there is a child in the back seat ) ; he then is telling her what is wrong and BAM ... they get killed . Okay , this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie . When I was watching this movie in the theatre I was with some friends . This was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie . We all decided to see a suspense / thriller that looked good to everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life . Not only did I waste $ 7.oo on a movie ticket , but I had to sit through torture for the brain . This movie started off with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought " " this cant be bad " ... " I was so wrong . The whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense ; even if you can get passed the bad acting , the " " not so scary " " storyline , and the over all horrible mess this movie was , you will still be puzzled . It 's not because you 're not smart enough to understand it , it 's because no human with a brain could comprehend what this stupid movie is about . Right now you may be thinking " " Oh man ! I have to watch this movie just to see if it 's as bad as this person says it is " . " GET THAT THOUGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW ! ! ! I 'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that there is no point in even considering seeing it . Please people don 't make the same mistake i did thinking that this movie has potential ... it doesn 't . I give this movie 1 out of 10 ( if I could give a zero I would ) , and I do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie , you 'll be saving yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w.t.f. that freaking movie is about . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

One thing is very clear ... Whenever there will be an encounter between Pakistan and India .... we will win .... ! ! !

" Evil Aliens owes a huge debt to Peter Jacksons early films Bad Taste and Braindead.I must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about this.Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up to.I lost count of the amount of times a major Hollywood film was quoted most notably James Camerons Aliens.The amount of blood and gore on show here isn 't funny either , the latter end of the film becomes tired and dragged out.Maybe it would have worked better as a short film.The actors a poor , the direction is weak and the plot is non existent.I can see what the director was trying to do , the homage he was trying to pay , but others have done the same thing a lot better than presented here . 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle / plains.Its a turkey and the some . What it really is is wildly mismatched footage from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent ( to the release ) footage of men on a safari . There are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit , south seas natives at sea ( used to represent people in the middle of Africa ) , women in bikini 's , horrible narration and a guy in a loin cloth with make up all over his body ( racially insensitive I think so ) . This is a movie to sit and make fun of- but only with lots of alcoholic drinks and witty friends . At any other time this is going to be a chore to get through . Its a bad bad bad movie .

" I did not have too much interest in watching The Flock.Andrew Lau co-directed the masterpiece trilogy of Infernal Affairs but he had been fired from The Flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called Niels Mueller.I had the feeling that Lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study , so they fired him and hired another director.This usually does not work well ( let 's remember The Invasion ) .But The Flock resulted to be better than what I expected.It 's not a great film but it 's an interesting and entertaining thriller.The character development is very well done and I could know the characters very well.Also , the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible.Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances.Now , let 's go to the negative points.One element which really bothered me ( there was a moment in which it irritated me ) was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more " " attitude " " and style.That tricks feel out of place and their presence is arbitrary.Plus , I think the film should have been more ambitious.In spite of that , I recommend The Flock as a good thriller.It 's not memorable at all , but it 's entertaining . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Two things are always signs that you 're going to be watching a bad movie : 1 ) If you 're instantly reminded of other movies like THE TERMINATOR , HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER during the title sequence 2 ) If there 's a death during a sex scene straight after the title sequenceThere 's actually a third warning sign and that 's a caption indicating lazy exposition warning the poor ignorant naive audience of the dangers of corporate greed . Guess what ? CYBORG 2 starts with a caption warning us of corporate greed in the future , followed by a title sequence that reminded me of THE TERMINATOR , HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER followed by a death during a sex scene ! Hey you don 't suppose I 'll be watching a bad movie by any chance ? As you can guess this is a bad movie . It 's basically a series of action scenes written around a thread bare plot of a cyborg on the run from a greedy corporate company . It 's badly written , directed and acted and most especially it 's badly lit which means it 's very difficult to see what 's happening on screen , though I 'm not entirely sure this is actually a bad thing . The only interest to be had is that it 's the film debut of Angelina Jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the prophetic line " " They 're lovely , I wonder if they 're real ?

" I totally agree that the reenactments kill what could otherwise be a great show . I 'll admit that I 'd seen 1 or 2 episodes last season and was not clear at all that it was all reenacted . But when I caught one episode recently it suddenly jumped out at me BIG TIME and I lost interest immediately . Then I noticed the disclaimer at the start before an episode that followed . Has anyone followed the show closely enough to tell me , did they actually make the " " acting " " and reenacting parts more artificial on purpose , or did I just not notice before . I 'm usually pretty good at sensing this stuff , but the recent episode was so obviously artificial I practically tripped over it . Now I have no interest whatsoever in watching and have given up entirely on it . It just doesn 't have any real value if it 's all scripted and acted . And at least lately , it seems VERY poorly scripted and acted . The comment above that says who cares if it 's all reenactments , I do .

" The first five minutes of this movie showed potential . After that , it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy .

There are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point . The thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it grossed $ 22 million in the box office and only cost about $ 1.5 million to make .

" First of all , the big named actors must need the money ...

" Solo starts as a team of US soldiers go into Soth America to blow up a rebel airstrip , joining them is a robot named Solo ( Mario Van Peebles ) who can use any weapon ever made , is fifteen times stronger & ten times faster than any human being . Something goes wrong though & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which Colonel Frank Madden ( William Sadler ) isn 't happy about , back at base & General Haynes ( Barry Corbin ) orders Solo to be shut down & reprogrammed . One of Solo 's main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the South American jungles where Colonel Madden & his men are sent in to recapture it ... This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba & one has to say Solo is awful . The script by David Corley was based on the novel ' Weapon ' by Robert Mason & is one clich챕 after another , robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood & at the box-office so Solo rip-offs the likes of Robocop ( 1987 ) , Universal Soldier ( 1992 ) & the two Terminator flicks as well as having the same setting & basic story as Predator ( 1987 ) . This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people , at first he doesn 't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions & starts to befriend people , sounds like Terminator 2 : Judgment Day ( 1991 ) to me . The character 's are poor & Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating Solo at all & why he would kill other US soldiers & disobey orders to destroy it . You know I saw this on cable telly last night for free ( thank god I didn 't spend any money on it ) & I looked it up in the TV guide & do you know what it said ? My TV guide described Solo as a ' dire sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels ' which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo . In less than ten words my TV guide has hit the nail on the head , I mean it 's a sci-fi action film , it certainly stars Mario Van Peebles & it 's definitely dire . Enough said really.Director Barba doesn 't do anything particularly special here & the action scenes lack any real excitement & the sci-fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact Solo is a robot . So the military lose Solo & Colonel Madden is sent in to recapture it right ? I 'm not being funny but wouldn 't the military have put a ' self destruct ' mechanism inside Solo in case something like that happened ? Surely at the very least Solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time ? I 'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong ? The violence is mild , there are a few OK fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really.Technically the film looks alright & is competently made , it was actually shot in Mexico . The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action flick Agent Red ( 2000 ) edited footage from Solo into that film . The acting is poor , Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot ... William Sadler deserves better than this , it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic Die Hard 2 : Die Harder ( 1990 ) .Solo is a really bad sci-fi action flick which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action films like Robocop , Universal Soldier & the Terminator films . Not recommend & I 'm going to start & pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing films to watch ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Lois Weber , self proclaimed missionary via the cinema , wrote , directed and produced other films on controversial subjects , but this may be the first to get wide viewing , thanks to TCM .

" This movie describes a truly horrific event , to be sure . But it all falls down from poor performances from all the cast . It is impossible to feel the emotion of almost any character , as all the emotional scenes seem like parodies of themselves . For example , a character is shot at the start of the movie , and you get the clich챕d desperate , " " Am I gonna make it , Sergeant ? " , " " " Yeah it ain 't nothing ' " , " but it plays out like a sketch from a Wayans Brothers movie ( I don 't know if they 've made the War Movie yet ) or something starring Leslie Nielsen.The sergeant played by Sean Penn reminds me of Al Bundy from Married With Children , while Fox is the greatest self-deprecating good-guy clich챕 you can imagine ... Thank God he curses and smokes during it.His emotional " " NOOOO ! ! ! " " is definitely more suited to comedies like Back To The Future than so-called serious movies such as this.To their credit , some of the " " main " " scenes ...

" Despite decades of tax incentives , in terms of international visibility the Canadian film industry still lags behind most central African and Islamic states ( surprisingly few Canadian films are released outside their native shores ) , and Nouvelle-France aka Battle of the Brave is another example of why . More than any other country , commercial Canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries ' failures . On paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising . There 's certainly a rich vein of untapped material in Canada 's history as the French and English warred over and bought and sold the colony , though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blink-and-you 'll-miss-it scene of characters saying " " Wolfe is dead " " or " " Nouvelle-France is no more " " before getting back to the soap operatics . But while this isn 't a history lesson , it isn 't a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either : there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of shelling by a half-dozen re-enactors and one collapsed shed . The town square that is all we ever see of Quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior , giving many scenes an old TV miniseries look , as does director Jean Beaudin 's reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors . What you do get for your money is a simple but drawn-out Harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that Fabio doesn 't turn up in the cast . It 's the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfall.An Anglo-Canadian-French co-production that doesn 't so much unite once-warring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew , this massive box-office disaster was clearly intended to be Canada 's Titanic - though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film , not the ship - but turns out more like Revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes , crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds . The Montreal Mirror described it as " " so bad that one can 't even find the strength to mock it . " " That 's rather unfair , because while for most of its running time the film looks like a below-par 80s miniseries , the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny , with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps , dastardly husbands declaring " " You 'll never see your handsome lover again , cuckold 's honor ! You 'll pay for this , both of you ! " " and our heroine accused of murder and - gasp ! - witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in Demi Moore 's version of The Scarlet Letter . Throw in caddish British governors , devious slaves and Celine Dion singing at the end and you 've got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that Timbo Hines was aspiring to ( and still managed to miss wildly ) with his legendarily inept period version of War of the Worlds , albeit without the staggering technical incompetence.Leading man David La Haye 's versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film : he starts out looking like Andy Garcia , briefly adopts the Al Pacino Revolution look , flirts with the clean-shaven Tch챕ky Karyo style before turning into a younger Ted Danson as his character ages . While his opening scene where he reacts to news of his father 's death with an expression that looks like he 's waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting , in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor who 's lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed . He shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isn 't there . Billie Piper lookalike Noemie Godin-Vigneau 's leading lady doesn 't exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying center-stage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly Vincent Perez 's corrupt and perverted Intendant Le Bigot ( that really is the character 's name ) , the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey Sebastien Huberdeau and , saddest of all , Gerard Depardieu 's bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky grey-haired wig . It 's a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like he 's not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it . He clearly couldn 't be bothered to stick around for the English dubbing sessions ( or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled ) . Small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the film 's brief release.Some brief comic relief is provided by Jason Isaacs in his default Patriot mode who overplays Wolfe of Quebec rather like an asthmatic Alf Garnett / Archie Bunker played by Timothy Dalton on speed while Tim Roth 's William Pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one who 's being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off , though like Colm Meaney 's Benjamin Franklin they 're both in the film for less than three minutes . ( Voltaire and Madame Pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression , comic or otherwise . ) The supporting actresses are generally better : Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as the heroine 's real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful Irene Jacob looking for all the world like a young Fanny Ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I am , as many are , a fan of Tony Scott films . When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like ' Man On Fire ' . To find out that the movie it 's the furthest thing from it ! The story was treading water from the get go , and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such such a good idea . And the whole ' arm 'scene was too gratuitous ! The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly , and this movie reveals that she 'll never become a movie star ! The movie brought some of the worst acting ever.I like Tony Scott 's direction ' n all , but this takes the whole friggin cake ! Sorry Ton , 1 out of 10 ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The movie is an adaptation of a Japanese story by the respected author Yukio Mishima . It simply doesn 't make the transition into a credible story about Brits and Americans.The story moves sluggishly , especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ship 's prow cutting through the waves , and the little route line filling in on the maps , while their letters are heard in overvoice . The film moves so languidly that I even fast-forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which , although long , are not really either passionate or erotic . The film did achieve a measure of notoriety when Kristofferson 's then-wife divorced him for extra-curricular activities with Miss Miles during the filming . I guess they enjoyed the sex scenes , but it isn 't quite the same for a viewer.There are no characters to hang on to . The sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable , the little kid is detestable . Kristofferson is amiable enough , but he just doesn 't have the acting skills to bring much to the role , although perhaps we don 't really want get too involved with him , considering his ultimate fate.As for the little kid , well , he kinda falls in with a bad crowd after his dad dies , and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his mum 's life . Now this is a really bad crowd . They don 't just shoplift and smoke dope , nosireebib . They slip a mickey to a cat and vivisect it . This is shown in gory detail . But of course , this is only practice so they can do the same thing to Kristofferson ! So the movie mostly moves slowly , with no characters to relate to , and when something does happen it is unrelentingly morbid.The ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you 'll ever see.This all might have made some sense if the Japanese locale and cultural context had been retained . As it stands , it is just abysmal . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years. not only was the acting incredibly bad , the storyline ( if you can call it that ) was just as bad . Offcourse everyone knows what 's going to happen within the first 5 minutes . Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment . That however , is not the case . There is no action , no suspense , not even a spark between the 2 leading actors .

" and abysmal , over-the-top acting , you might enjoy this rubbish flick.Apparently atomic bombs makes life mutate in about a day or two ( or according to other viewers , wake them up ) . Or so it seems . And apparently massive atomic explosions off the coast of Spain doesn 't make anyone ask any questions at all . Coming to think of it , the plot doesn 't make sense in any way whatsoever ( why would evil sock puppets attack lighthouses ? ) , so the nukes going off for no reason at all doesn 't stand out too much.OK , getting past this , and the fact that the " " monster " " is a glorified thing you make of socks in kindergarten , you may actually be able to stand this . But for once the complete lack of gore doesn 't help , leaving the monster attacks in all their naked rock-bottom-budget " " glory " .

" The actors are so bland that it 's almost impossible to tell them apart ( Pauline Kael said of this movie : " " The actors have names , but they 're truly anonymous " " ) , and the special effects are really bad . They simulate weightlessness with people hanging on cables and by recycling the trick that let Fred Astaire dance on the ceiling in " " Royal Wedding " " ( but none of these guys move well enough to make it look convincing ) . The low point of the movie is when one of the characters , an airplane tycoon , is trying to convince some other " " giants of industry " " to come in with him in a moon-rocket consortium , and he shows them a Woody Woodpecker cartoon that explains how a rocket works at a 2nd grade level ! ( And to think that Robert Heinlein worked on the screenplay ... ) The only plus is that the production design manages to communicate a sort of " " Amazing Stories " " sensibility , and even that is done much better in the producer 's ( George Pal ) subsequent movie " " When Worlds Collide " , " which has similar bad acting , but is much more entertaining . However , Pal 's best sci-fi movie has to be " " The Time Machine " . " , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie . After all , this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind , and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid ( even before Tolkien ) . I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT . They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera . The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles . It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles ( who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers , utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem ) turn to " " Fabio on the beach " " in the guise of Pitt ( who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced ) . The actors were actually decent , trying to make the best of a ridiculous script . It was actually a waste of so much talent ( Peter O 'Toole stole the show , and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic ) . Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn 't even hold a candle to them . Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege . I wouldn 't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was ( at least they got that part right ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When a Stranger Calls belongs to the group of this year 's remakes , with movies like Poseidon just over the horizon . Director Simon West ( Con Air ) helms this updated version , with plenty of relative unknown casts , which signals either the death rate is high ( it isn 't ) , or that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkey.Clocking in at a relatively short 87 minutes , it 's primarily made up of two acts . The first , which takes a full one hour , is the setup . Our heroine , Jill Johnson ( Camilla Belle ) , chalked up 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone ( do the math ) , and as a lesson in responsibility , her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her . To pay off her debt , she works part time as a babysitter , and looking after the wealthy Mandrakis ' kids , is her first stint.The huge Mandrakis mansion gets a full tour treatment , as it is where all the action will take place . Plenty of rooms ( makes for good hiding ) , an indoor pool sized aquarium-pond ( to get wet in , for the wet T-shirt treatment ) , and check this out - motion detector lights , which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of lights and shadows . Naturally , prank calls , red herrings are aplenty , which chalks up this act 's runtime , but most of them fall flat in the suspense department.There 's a minor trend emerging , with actors being the unseen , providing and acting through their voice instead . Recent attempts include Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven , and Hugo Weaving 's V for Vendetta . Here , Lance Henriksen does the honours for the anonymous , nameless psychotic killer , but it just falls flat . Why ? The script doesn 't give him much dialogue . Most of the phone calls made were of the silent ( mind-masturbatory ) nature , which I felt was a waste - they could have also casted some unknown instead , and the job will still get done.The second act , where the main action takes place , is too little too late . And the bogeyman , well , is purely a bogeyman . Those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed , as basically it 's a one -woman show to hold your attention in the first hour ( eye candies always succeed ) , and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time , ala Rachel McAdams in Red Eye . Don 't expect any form of character development , nor subplots that will engage.The ending tried to be too smart for its own good , and came across as a cheap way to end the movie . There 's not much of goodness to highlight from this movie - no scares , no thrills , no enigmatic villain , and plenty of security flaws , especially with that door alarm - the only thing it 's good for , is to provide a number for 4D . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was it bad .. From the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography-- none of it worked . Not to mention the set design / costumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period ( it spans the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so ) . Even John Hurt , who 's usually an amazing actor , was so over-the- top ridiculous . Granted , Quinten Crisp is an over-the-top guy to begin with , but Hurt was given nothing to work with here . I don 't know much else to say except the audience I saw it with absolutely loved it .. so maybe it 's just me . But audiences love anything at film festivals when they 're sitting next to the director and all the actors . It 's not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it will play . Personally , I thought this movie was terrible . On the other hand , it was so terrible that it was hilarious .

" All I can say about this movie , is it is absolutely boring . The intro to the movie is quite possibly the worst intro to a horror film I have ever seen , I mean a angry chick hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan isn 't at all frightening which is what I assume the director was aiming for , but in fact it was " " mildly " " funny . The acting in this picture was beyond pathetic ; a note to directors , if your making a horror film , please hire some good actors , not some popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act.The death scenes in this movie were beyond boring ... no gore , and i 'm sorry but horror movies without gore , or good suspense are just cheesy . I mean this girl gets killed by hair wrapped all around her in the middle of Tokyo , and not one person sees it happen , they just declare her as " " missing " , " wow thats awesome !

" Some might remember if having seen the film Juno a scene where Ellen Page has a moment of praise for Dario Argento 's Suspiria , her favorite horror film . Jason Bateman 's character then asks if she 's ever seen a Herschel Gordon Lewis film , and to wit he has a copy of a movie ( I forget which at the moment ) and shows it to her . At the time I saw Juno I had seen Suspiria and a few Argento films but not Lewis . Now I can see that it 's not just another one of Diablo Cody 's pop-culture " " in " " references , but something that actually is an indicator on the tastes of the characters and , maybe more subjectively , how to judge them based on their tastes . In other words , Herschel Gordon Lewis 's reputation is maintained some many years after he ended making his gore films - and it 's that of a schlock-Meister , no more no less . Actually , less.It 's interesting then to take Argento as a basis of comparison , because both filmmakers approach , at least in the case of The Gore Gore Girls and , well , any given Argento picture , similar material . Where Argento is extraordinarily conscious about his craft , getting an audience wrapped up in whatever little story there is by the power of the movement of camera and music and style , Lewis takes the easy route to get at an audience , which is with an immature script and ( putting it lightly ) lackluster direction . The Gore Gore Girls reveals a filmmaker who isn 't interested in entertaining his audience in an actual compelling way as a horror film , but as a side-show or a brothel . He can 't direct actors worth a damn , he lights like it 's a porno movie , and for every one possibly clever or funny one-liner there 's ten that either totally stink or are too clever by half or not clever nearly enough.That being said , perhaps as the best substantive thing to say about The Gore Gore Girls , a mystery movie about a detective ( 2nd rate Sherlock Holmes guy played by somewhat amusing Frank Kress ) and a newspaper reporter ( dummie Amy Farrell ) investigating a series of murders of go-go dancers , is that it serves as the template for countless more Troma-style pictures . Perhaps this is faint praise , however , and really the best thing that can truly be said is that Henny Youngman- " " Take my wife , please ! " " - has a few scenes and steals every one of them without having to try much . It 's sad , since it could be the kind of picture that could entertain on an awesomely-bad level . But even on that score one may laugh more out of embarrassment for the production , some of the actors ( i.e. that guy who plays the cop , my God ) than out of some guilty pleasure enjoyment.Even the gore itself is somewhat of a letdown . At first one thinks that Lewis is at least delivering on this end , showing these women being murdered in crazy and vicious and exaggerated ways . But with the killings it all goes on longer than necessary ; I don 't mean this in terms of shock value , for that it 's fine . But there needs to be something else to really make it " " stick " , " that showing women 's faces dissected and eyes gouged is fine if you 're 12 and seeing this as one of you 're first ' horror ' films . It becomes , dare I say it , dull . Dangerously dull for such a " " daring " " so-called movie.This was Lewis 's last film until 30 years later an apparently worthy swan song came with a sequel to a film he made earlier brought him out of his retirement from movies and job in writing books on how to make it in business . However , whatever experience he had coming up to this one doesn 't show . It 's not a failure , but it could have been , and it 's just simply ... schlock . Take it or leave it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's reassuring to see that other IMDb reviewers have had the good sense to pan this disappointing film , at the risk of blaspheming against the great Vadim , Malle and Fellini.These directors may be talented & artistic in their own right ; however in attempting to pass off this hodgepodge of attempted eroticism and 60s chic as * in any way * related to Edgar Allen Poe 's stories , they exposed themselves as frauds . Either ( A ) they didn 't bother to read the Poe stories , or ( B ) they read them but were so transfixed by their own egotistical agenda that they didn 't pay Poe any mind.Imagine if Metallica plugged in their guitars , cranked the amps up to 11 and moshed out 3 chords claiming it to be Beethoven 's 9th Symphony . That 's the feeling you 'll get after sitting through this film . If you 're a Vadim / Malle / Fellini fan ( Metallica ) , you 'll dig it . If you 're a Beethoven fan ( Poe ) , you 'll puke.METZERGENSTEIN ... Here we begin with a bizarre porno version of Poe . OK , " " porno " " may be a bit extreme haha , but at the very least you have to call it a Barbarella version ( including , I don 't doubt , some of Jane 's outfits coming directly from the set of that scifi romp ) . Vadim falls into old clich챕s of his own : the girl lying on a bed being pleasured by some man whilst from the pillow-cam we see the apathy in her eyes ; the general lassitude and ennui of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism . Cute stuff , but " " Metzergenstein " " ain 't the place for it . And in addition to the Barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes , Jane Fonda 's awful American accent and unconvincing performance as a European countess made this the worst casting since Julia Roberts in that lousy version of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.WILLIAM Wilson ... Here 's a great Poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world . If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme , go watch Star Trek episode # 27 " " The Alternative Factor " . " But here , Malle glazes over that central theme and instead focuses on ... any guesses ... ? yup , eroticism , sadism and debauchery . Ho hum . Brigitte Bardot 's role is a complete fabrication to accomplish that end , and once again the director distorts a classic Poe story into a masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual issues . Do it on your own time , Malle . I thought we 're here on Poe 's dime.TOBY DAMMIT .... The absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst film I 've seen since " " Staying Alive " . " At least Fellini showed some tact in changing the title , but his departure from the original plot , theme and humour of the story is so vast , I wonder if he just picked this reel out of his private collection of home movies , stamped " " Edgar Allen Poe story " " on it and submitted it to this collection . I strained very hard to find any thread of familiarity with Poe 's works , but there was absolutely none.The original Poe story ( " " Never Bet the Devil Your Head " " ) is a short and hilarious dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims " " I 'll bet the devil my head ... " " On a foggy morning , the devil takes him up on his offer . The result is the sickest and silliest thing you 've ever read . This was Poe , the comedian , at his finest ( yes , Poe wrote many comedies . Also check out " " A Predicament " " and " " Devil in the Belfry " " if you want a taste of his witty , satirical works ) .This Fellini version ? It 's bland , soulless , and not funny at all ( unless you consider it funny to see a drunk stumbling over himself for 45 minutes ) . Here Fellini 's egotistical rant is about an artist struggling with the hypocrisy , pretense and mediocrity of cinema . Most of it is set at an awards ceremony where Fellini beats us over the head with sarcasm , cynicism and that classic " " sour grapes " " attitude that we find in all Fellini films dealing with cinema . Note the sarcastic jabs at " " the critics " , " a recurring theme in Fellini 's films . For someone who considered himself above the critics , Fellini sure spent a lot of time talking about them . At any rate , I feel like Fellini just took some outtakes from 8 1 / 2 , spliced them together and sold it as a Poe story . Worst " " adaptation " " ever.I think I put more effort into typing this review than any of the three directors put into making a Poe movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First of I should point out that I used to love Winnie The Pooh as a child and I really enjoyed The Tigger Movie even though I am in my 20 's.But this movie was so bad I was ashamed to have been a fan in my youth.OK , OK I know this is a movie for kids and isn 't aimed at people like me anyway but this is my thoughts on the movie for other people of my age.The main downfall in this film is the heffalump itself , it has to be the most annoying character I have seen in a child 's movie ( possibly even more annoying then the young child in Monsters Inc ) . It has the most annoying voice and prattles around singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments , I know Pooh movies aren 't exactly high brow but this was insulting to even a 2 year old 's intelligence ! Secondly - where was the story ? Previous Pooh outings had a least a point to the story- yes I can see this was about accepting people who are different to you into your hearts - but really it ended and I felt like I had watched a 5 minute cartoon on kids TV.I don 't have children of my own but when I do I fully intend to show them quality children 's movies like The Tigger Movie , Toy Story and Finding Nemo ( even though they are too childish for me these days I can see how they would be of great appeal to young children ) .

" What I found so curious about this film--I saw the full 4 hour roadshow version , is how oddly dispassionate it is . For a film about 2 very charismatic men--Castro and Che , engaged in a gargantuan political struggle , it 's almost totally devoid of emotional fire . The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir ( who is at best a second level actor , with a slightly high pitched voice ) have no drama or depth and basically come down to Castro telling Che : go here , go there , do this and that , with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in . Odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play Castro--Joaquim de Almeida , but he 's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half . Without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers , the film becomes a dullish epic-length film about hairy , bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end . Several of the reviews I 've read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely . ( One in fact spent more time talking about Soderbergh 's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it 's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles . ) This is an odd , odd thing to do since a ) Soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b ) it 's no more than a competent job of work , with an unremarked upon nod to Oliver Stone 's JFK in the black and white cut up camera-work when Che visits New York . If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty , you 'd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Right up ( or down ) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace.The premise sounded cool , some of the commercials looked semi-promising , but alas , the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot-ness , and that was shown on the small screen 's 30 second slot.If you want amateur writing , second-rate effects , ridiculous costumes , and an all-around snoozefest by all means watch it . The plot is recycled sci-fi fodder . Too bad too , because coming in I thought it would be bad but held out hope . It may be the worst movie I have ever seen , and I have seen a lot . Bottom line - Don 't watch it.Unless of course you -liked- any of the above 3 movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Forget the fact that most people expect an action movie form Seagal . This movie simply had no substance . Very long , drawn out , and boring . Scenes were much longer than they had to be - the camera would often focus on something for long periods of time when absolutely nothing was happening . Cure for insomnia . Worst Seagal movie by far ( I do like some of his other movies ) . 1 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake . The DVD version titled " " The One-Armed Swordsmen " " was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent , sequential story . Some of the story was left in separate chapters , which you can select from the main menu , but the DVD is still a mess . Don 't rent or buy it . Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story , an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense . Much as I liked seeing Wang Yu in his prime again after all these years , this one is an utter waste of time . I 've had dish detergents that made a better film than this . What the chopped-up DVD version shows us is that no matter how silly a Chinese script may be , you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out.But " " The One-Armed Swordsmen " " does offer you do the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh beating up smirking pretty boy David Chiang -- it 's always a pleasure to see that happen . Lo plays a sort of second-string villain here , and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. he film is also graced by the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as the magistrate . Another comment above mentions the obligatory fight-in-the-inn scene ( there are two , in fact ) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons , making Bruce Lee noises while they fight . None of this makes any sense , but that 's okay if you 're not expecting any clarity or common sense . It was fun to watch anyway.Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters . There are a couple of female roles , but they play no serious role in the action or the plot.If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie , the one which explains why he has only the one arm and why he uses a broken sword , go for it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" And now for another point of view : I didn 't like it . I didn 't finish it in fact . I know that " " Unforgiven " " is ranked by some as one of the greatest Westerns ever made . I know that it stars and was directed by Clint Eastwood , one of the icons of American cinema . I know that it won a bunch of Oscars . Still , I didn 't like it . I don 't like Westerns , and that 's clearly a matter of taste , but I also don 't admire Eastwood 's acting . He is not and never has been a leading man . He is no Burt Lancaster , no Paul Newman , no John Wayne . In this film alone he is dwarfed by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman ; they are both actors . No , Eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys . Here he plays a retired tough guy . When I see him on screen , I see a man laboring at his acting . Then there 's the anti-Western Western plot . It is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values -- a respect for the role of women , blacks , native Americans , and single parents ; a disrespect for violence and drinking ; the wholesomeness that comes with marriage , including interracial marriage , and small adorable children -- into a century in which those values weren 't necessarily accepted , at least in these ways . By promoting those values , the movie comes across as mannered , if not preachy . Then there are the hoary movie stereotypes -- prostitutes with hearts of gold , the kid who can 't shoot straight , the city slicker new to the wild West , the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords . Finally there is the pacing of Eastwood 's direction . I gave up after an hour . Eastwood was still riding north , chatting with Morgan Freeman and the kid who couldn 't shoot straight , sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion . It was way too slow . Somebody had to find these elements uncompelling . I am afraid it was me . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I 've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time , this one however , takes the cake . More comedy than horror , " " Full Moon High " " puts the " " c " " in cheese-fest . The star quality in this movie is not bad . Just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill . Adam Arkin plays Tony , an all-American high school football player of the 50 's who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania .

" First off , I am critical of this movie because I really had high hopes and instead , this movie sucked . * possible spoilers * ( if you haven 't seen the TV series ) Where to begin ? ? ? Well , let 's start at the quality . The movie was barely better than the original TV series and the two fight scenes were very nicely crafted . However the CGI was horrid.Then there is the plot holes and questions that still remain after the whole movie is all said and done . This movie does not close off as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe known as FMA and only returns to expand the universe more before leaving us with nothing but our imaginations to decipher what would happen in the future.And then there is the stories biggest fault . Adding WWII and Hitler ... WHY ? ? The series was perfect ... and didn 't need Hitler . It didn 't even need Germany.Overall the entire movie was sorely lacing in what a true FMA movie could have been and if I were the directors , I 'd scrap CoS and make a new , more " " ending " , " ending . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Recap : A band of five young American men , all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the Ardenne offensive during the WWII get the assignment as a forward outpost and to look for enemy activity . They 're in really bad condition , both physically and mentally , and think they have struck gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once plush mansion full with food . But after a while there is some enemy activity , and it is very odd . Not hostile , but odd . It seems like there is a German squad out there , in equally bad condition , that want nothing more than to surrender.Comments : Based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story doesn 't seem to translate very well to the big screen . Indeed it is a different war movie , much more about the mental pressure during wartimes than fighting and battles . But I can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense , full of uncertainties and unknown elements , just fall flat in the movie . It is not suspenseful , just different and in many ways absurd . Many times people just act insane , and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at.So when this mental pressure fails to come through , the main building piece of the entire story , I thought the story fell through . It wasn 't good , it wasn 't interesting , it didn 't keep me on the edge and it didn 't really send a message . Actually it did nothing.The cast is interesting , many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers . The acting is good , but not stellar , and a few characters also fell through into the absurd zone . Much of that too I feel is due to that this story , these characters need the time , space and pace given in a novel , that they can 't be given here . And going halfway definitely isn 't good enough.4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I noticed that " " Hamish Macbeth " " was being broadcast in the United States , I was thrilled . I then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing . I adore M. C. Beaton 's books about the wonderful Scottish Constable . The characters in the book are entertaining and very well-written . The powers that be who are responsible for this mish-mash apparently have never have read one of Beaton 's books . Only the name " " Hamish Macbeth " " has anything to do with the series . Besides the lack of familiar characters , I find the whole show offensively loud . It seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other . If you love M. C. Beaton 's adorable Hamish Macbeth don 't waste your time on this rubbish . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" 1st watched 7 / 29 / 2001 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-Mark Dindal ) : Fast-paced , frantic animation effort by Ted Turner 's feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters , but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains . I 'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about . Mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to Disney efforts like Aladdin and Lion King .

" I went in to see D-War on a whim and with very low expectations . The movie failed to meet them.I don 't mind stories that stretch credulity - remember Reign of Fire ? - but I do expect them to be internally consistent . This film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath , all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla.A shape-shifting mystic warrior from Korea , curiously metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess . A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned up on ancient Korean folklore because of the Fed 's excellent " " paranormal division " " - which has gone unremarked up to this point . Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims " " I never meant for this to happen . " " A reincarnated pair of long dead Koreans who " " died like star-crossed lovers . " " Mystic pendants , faceless hordes of robotic soldiers ( that owe a lot to Peter Jackson 's orcs ) and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it.The dialogue is appalling , the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was , to be honest , tedious . However , for me the crowning moment was at the end , after the finale , when the music for the closing credits was - Arirang ! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing " " Ran " " with a karaoke rendition of My Way - and let me be clear that I am in no way comparing director Shim to Kurosawa.In short , a self indulgent , lackluster collection of clich챕s and narrative non-sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in Koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even a not so-serious movie goer . I would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video , but I 'm not even sure that it 's worth that much . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I want to state first that I am a Christian ( and that I do work in the film and TV industry ) so I understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard . I 'm all for positive , uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life ( that this is a fallen world and that things don 't always work out ... even for followers of Christ ) . I 'm glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt Christian message ; for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face . A movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes , exposition aplenty , and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least . I believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across . I 'm sure the Kendrick bros. will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well . Maybe they could direct someone else 's screenplay as their next project . * Sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one ( Hoosiers , Field of Dreams , etc ) can inspire in a multitude of ways .

" New York attorney plots to rid himself of his senile mother after meeting an attractive , available woman . Screenwriter Robert Klane , adapting his own novel ( the kind of paperback kids would buy for the dirty parts ) , doesn 't seem to have any knowledge of mental illness : to him , it 's just an excuse for prurient comedy and scatological jokes . George Segal--who , in the 1960s , starred mostly in war and espionage pictures--had become , by this time , one of America 's greatest sad-sack comedians ; his nutty reactions and batty responses rival only his mother 's inscrutabilities . Segal is paired well with Trish Van Devere , and their moments of connection ( though also played for laughs ) are really the only sequences one can gravitate towards . Ruth Gordon , lovable as is she , is simply around too much--and more of her amounts to less . This is one of the worst directed and edited films I have ever seen from so-called professionals .

" Clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes , " " Salaam-e-Ishq " " is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love ( which is at least four tales too many in my estimation ) .Filmed like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial , the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings , dazzling colors , sexy showgirls , high-stepping song-and-dance numbers , dream and fantasy sequences , winking character asides , corny dialogue and way-over-the-top comical performances - all pretty much standard-issue stuff when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days .

" OK , I know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as Watership Down is a " " classic " " and a standard part of most people 's childhood , but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18 , I must admit : I really hated it.We watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it , and many people who whimpered at the very words " " Watership Down " " - their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams- recommended it . To be honest , I wish I hadn 't bothered . I gave it the benefit of the doubt ; generally I don 't like to stop watching a film half way through . This was an exception . It was really , really , excruciatingly , sickeningly dull . This film was possibly the slowest thing I 've ever watched ( imagine a doped-up snail in space ) , and really didn 't " " do it " " for me . The art was alright ; the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee , yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced.I 'm not going to go into huge details about the storyline ; basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area . Generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment , it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across . For me , I kind of wished that they would get gassed , not because I 'm a horrible sadistic person , but because the characters were uninspiring , annoying , dull and generally quite rude ( oh I 'm so terribly English ) . I found that I was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film , and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened , and even that was a terrible anticlimax.If I were to praise it in any way , I 'd have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well-meaning . Maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy , but the message it 's trying to put forth is good in its nature . The musical score was not bad , too.So , to conclude , this film is pretty poor . I couldn 't watch it the whole way through , or I 'd probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom . Granted , it isn 't " " Torque " " bad , but it still doesn 't rate highly in my eyes , so I 've given it a 2 / 10.Hope this helps . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I have always been a fan of Bottom , grabbing as many videos as I could find of the series here in the states . The chemistry between Rik and Ade is always genius , and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail . I thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness ... and was utterly disappointed by the end.The first 3 / 4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed ( sorry , Ade ! ) , but with some utterly brilliant moments . Unfortunately , these laugh-out-loud moments make you realize how less-than-brilliant the rest of the movie is . The slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring , with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous.The end of the movie ( the ' green ' scenes , for those of you who 've seen it ) was ... perhaps the worst ending I 've seen in the past decade . Honestly . It was one joke repeated about thirty times , followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense ( which didn 't bother me ) and wasn 't funny ( which did ) .To sum up , I was sorely disappointed by this movie . I shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it , to retain the fondest memories that I can ... but I have to warn you , if you 're about to overpay for your NTSC conversion tape from the local importer , don 't .

" I just realized why the colors and sets in " " Sakuran " " were so flashy and gaudy , and just painful to look at . The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese . Their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out . But the director , Mika Ninagawa , had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character , or even the story . What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps . You couldn 't call it acting . It was nothing more than catering to her flipped-out , high-school-girl fan base . Hey Anna , good luck on that one as you get older . Yeah , right , an oiran as a crude and vulgar , prone- to-violence , biker chick . Didn 't we already see you portray this character in a more appropriate movie ? The story was painfully boring and predictable . What is the story of " " Sakuran " " ? An obnoxious little bitch ever remains true to her self which is just that : an obnoxious bitch . She finds that , inexplicably , men are attracted to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful , high-class prostitute even though she talks and behaves like she 's a member of a female biker gang . This so-called seductive ability of hers is talked about but we never see it in action , probably due to the ineptitude of the main , pretend-phony-biker chick , I mean " " actress . " " The main character of the movie makes a wealthy and powerful man angry at her because she keeps him waiting while she services a much more lowly customer . Not very oiran-like , is it ? How could such a woman ever become an oiran ? Oh , because the previous oiran got herself killed and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price . Who would pay a high price for a slut so cheap ? Rumors get around . How could there be no repercussions for what she did to the powerful guy ? Because the screenwriters are dolts . They just made up a bunch of crap.Then an even more wealthy and powerful guy falls for her ( why ? ) and she throws him over for a penniless guy who is generally cold and distant toward her but respects who she really is ( which doesn 't make sense . How can anyone respect someone so worthless ? ) .Speaking of crap , it 's like the director squatted down and took a huge , psychedelic-colored dump on the aesthetics , culture , and society of the Edo Period . What of such things as sabi , mono no aware , wabi , subtlety , elegance , a rigidly hierarchical society ? All shat upon by a director who comes off as a senseless , nouveau-riche parvenu . The amazing thing is that so many other Japanese , in watching this movie , squatted down around the director and took steaming spoonfuls of this blazing-colored stinking crap and exclaimed how tasty it was.Argentinean tango music with violin and bandoneon as backdrop for the Edo Period when Japan was totally isolated from the international world ( except for the 3.7 acres of Dejima ) ? Why not just have Anna , the bad-ass-biker oiran , answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character drive off in a hissy fit in his red Ferrari ? The music we had to listen to was jarring and anachronistic ( the same as the art design ) . Near the ending , I liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the shrine cherry tree . But , earlier , the second she said she would leave the quarters when it bloomed , we all knew exactly what would happen . How boring , to telegraph the ending so clearly . But what 's the point of the old tree blooming ? That rich and powerful guy already made the pleasure quarters bloom in cherry blossoms like the mountains of Yoshino in spring . That didn 't impress her at all ? No , of course not . I already know that about whores . The guys that treat them nicely get kicked in the balls . Maybe it bugs the whores to have people idealize them when they themselves know the truth of who they are : just cheap and worthless.Considering the director 's obsession with goldfish , the second to last scene should have been of a goldfish bowl on a verandah accidentally knocked over . Two fish tumble into a stream which carries them off to escape beyond the walls of the pleasure quarters , belying how goldfish are stuck in their bowl and can 't survive outside ( just like the denizen 's relationship with the pleasure quarters ) . Otherwise the talk of the fate of goldfish has no meaning.In the final scene the cherry trees were full in bloom , but the brevity of the blooms is one thing special about cherry blossoms . I couldn 't help thinking that soon enough dusk would wipe away all the soft pink color and warmth from the scene . The sky would go quickly from hints of shadow , into an ever- deepening gloom , and night would fall . It would become cold , very cold . And dark . That really wasn 't a happy ending , was it ? Romantic love ( in the Edo Period ? ) could survive in the face of terrible poverty and being ostracized for about as long as those cherry trees bloomed . Maybe a few days , unless it rained sooner . But the unconsummated romantic love we see here ? It 's existence in this period is incomprehensible.Anna Tsuchiya walking in the shoes of an oiran ? She couldn 't do it . Literally . Check out the scene of her " " promenade " " where she seems to have the correct footwear on but she has to hold on to some guy 's shoulder to keep from tumbling on her ass.I was going to give this movie two stars for the art direction but then I realized what that was all about : sick dominance on the part of the director . Those colors and sets are just the way the director has of screaming , " " I 'm the most important one here ! Me ! It 's all about me ! ! ! ! " " , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film . Thought visually stunning like all of Ang Lee 's work ( each still frame seems worthy of a print ) , I was really disappointed by the film 's disjointed pace . It really was too long.The story is set in Civil War era Missouri , and is about a young man ( Roedel ) who joins the feral forces of the Bushwackers , sort of renegade Confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the Jayhawkers , their Union counterparts . He and his close friend , Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich , join the group after Chile 's father is shot point-blank and his home is burned , presumably by Jayhawkers . The story follows Roedel 's and Chiles ' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war , including former slave who fights for the Bushwhackers ( Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright ) , and a war widow played by Jewel.It seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point , it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped . For example , the agitation among Roedel 's group caused by former slave Holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol , and then dropped until later in the movie . A young villian / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much angst and violence against him , but , we never know why . Some of the characters never seem to surface ; I think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history.The historical detail was excellent . I loved looking at the housing , furniture , clothes , etc . , and I thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters , though they stumbled a bit with the dialog .

The only reason you 're still there is because you brought your kids and you can 't leave them alone in the theater . You might catch a nap.Tim Hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk . He manages to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic , unsure actor in this production.I didn 't have much hope for this movie in the first place , I admit . If it weren 't basically the only family film I could take my son to around Christmas , my wife and I wouldn 't have gone . God , I wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves . I leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker I thought it was , but she beat me to the punch.I 'm not kidding . It 's putrid . Only David Cross 's terrific-as-usual work saves this review from being only 1 star.The story is cloying , insulting and stupid , as might be expected for a movie in this genre ( although the recent " " Curious George " " was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable ) . The acting is mostly poor . The decision to " " update " " the Chipmunks songs for today 's audience was inadvisable at best and boneheaded at worst . It does not work.The chipmunks of old were clever , mischievous and sly . These chipmunks are dumb , somewhat mean-spirited , obnoxious , and in a surprise , needy to the point of uselessness.Either as a retrospect , a tribute , or as a completely new production , this film totally fails .

" This one and the one prior " " Toulon 's Revenge " " and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice . It is basically choose your series , the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers , while the next three are a series of them being the good guys . This one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and I never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series . Basically , a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill , this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action Japanese shows like Ultraman . The movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not inflicting you with a very painful to watch movie . Just to many plot holes and things in it for it to be considered an okay movie . You do get to see the guy who played Toulon in the last movie though then you have a very anti-climatic battle and wham the movie is over before it really begins . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

If the plot did not force them to be friends , you don 't get the impression they want to hang out with each other . Plus , the sidekick has the more interesting personality . Ewww.The dialogue is predictable and boring.The narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the Dukes of Hazzard you can picture what this is like . I cannot believe the director would agree to this . It insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line I just witnessed.Hey , at least the horses and locations looked good , maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director.RATING-2 You may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act . The boring choreography of a Segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief . Worse yet , he 's woefully out of shape . Just what we need , a fat stiff who THINKS he 's a leading man . There 's not one iota of redeeming cinematic value in all this movies ninety or so minutes .

" This movie was awful . I had a very difficult time watching this all the way through . I didn 't get the point of the movie . What was the point of this movie ? The soundtrack was bad , acting was bad and the story uninspiring . The two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting . There was no chemistry among any of the cast members . I don 't know this for a fact , but I suspect that most of the actors were first timers . The movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot . That indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie .

" the author of the book , by the same title , should not have let her name be used for this movie. if you have read the book , this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details. the movie adds nothing , in terms of artistic merit , to the book 's own literary achievement.for those who have not read the book : you will also be disappointed. not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace , it doesn 't offer anything more while it is moving slowly ( like character development , for example ) . some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie , but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in therese and isabelle--its fairly tame and not imaginative at all . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie had so much potential . Anyone who followed the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it 's ridiculous . Too much time and effort was spent in the movie on Dahmer 's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption . Where was the character development ? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception . Where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals ? Instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer , but fail to address the major point in Dahmer 's development . Also , the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this ; his cannibalism and his desire for flesh , etc . I could go on , but to sum up , too many lagging points in the film , focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore - the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is " " Dahmer .

" Yes , this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes . Then they introduce Jinx , a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986 as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now . Kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kid 's kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space . This camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things . Give it a rest , they are there for fun , not to become astronauts just yet , just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp . However , you do get to see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role . So in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas , but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me . Probably for a few others as well , who else would like to see Kate Capshaw 's face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Robert Downey Jr. in a 17th century wig and dress was enough to make me shudder , but I couldn 't believe a great actor like Sam Neill actually took a part in this movie .

" In order to enjoy ' Fur - An imaginary portrait of Diane Arbus , ' Stephen Shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the American photographer , Diane Arbus . Paradoxically , it 's the very use of Diane Arbus ' name and knowledge to her life and work , that sets this film up to fail on a grand scale.What becomes apparent quite early on with the casting of the beautiful WASPish and glamorous Nicole Kidman as the anti-glamorous Jewish Diane Arbus , is that Shainberg didn 't get Arbus or what her work was about ( unsentimental realism ) and seems only attracted to Arbus on a superficial level through her photographs of circus freaks.What follows is a kind of pretty and trivial Beauty & the Beast fantasy biopic with Robert Downey JR as Kidman 's hairy fictional love interest . However , it 's not the banality of the story that is the main flaw in this film , but the director 's misogynistic stance that Diane Arbus , one of the art world 's most singular and original woman photographers , was incapable of forming her own ideas about her work . While his previous film ' Secretary ' was a study of female masochism , his continued portrayal of the female as submissive spoils this film completely - and flys in the face of the real life Diane Arbus ' courage , tenacity and fearlessness in single-handedly exploring the often shady world of outsiders.Imagine an imaginary biopic on pop star Madonna 's life with Guy Richie as her Svengali , the man behind her career , and you 'll get a feel of how seriously flawed and imaginary this film is : It can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject , or just choose to ignore all the facts.It 's a shame because once you remove all reference to Diane Arbus , this film could have stood up on its own as an interesting study on fetishism and a good companion piece to Secretary . 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" If there 's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film , it 's seeing it done by experienced film-makers who ought to know better . This " " re-imagining " " of Planet of the Apes could have used some imagination , to say nothing of essential elements of character development . Nova , the girl in the original Planet of the Apes , was a better developed character than Daena in this version , for all that she does not say a single word . One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton , a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence , wit and humour , all of which were notably absent from this production.There were problems in basic plot development . The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk . This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made * all * the difference in the original film . Even while he was mute , his ability to communicate was what marked out Heston 's Taylor as being different from the other humans . In the current film , Mark Wahlberg encourages the ( talking ) human slaves to revolt , but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already . They are dexterous tool-users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans , something mute humans can 't do . It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them . Indeed , since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre-technology era without ( at first ) any gadgets to help him , it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage , not the humans who are used to living there.It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg . Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act , at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson ( Wahlberg ) , and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung-ho freedom-fighter . This was poor character development . ( Estella Warren , in particular , looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script ) . Wahlberg 's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me , as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.Creating the apes : half a plus point and two minuses : Ape make-up was excellent on the males , particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes ( which was why he was so good in The Green Mile ) , and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully . But the ape females looked like nothing on earth , neither ape nor human . The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordon 's rocket : jumping apes looked as if they 'd just been fired from a catapult , they had none of the long-limbed grace of genuine apes . Secondly , the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal , probably feline , making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.In the original film , the various " " human " " things the apes do and say are handled as light relief ( " " I never knew an ape I didn 't like . " " " " Human see , human do ! " " ) . Here , the apes just talk matter-of-factly exactly as 21st Century humans do , and there is no humour in it at all . The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.Nothing made me cringe more than the " " V-Ger from Star Trek " " moment near the end of the film . First of all , the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past , for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form . Secondly , the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away , something any ape could have done centuries ago . This moment was , for me , far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.Things of that nature , however , are typical of most science fiction movies of today . Back in the ' 60s and ' 70s , they generally didn 't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets , but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional . I 'm thinking of 2001 : A Space Odyssey , the 1967 Planet of the Apes , THX1138 , Soylent Green , Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris . The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time . However , this film includes just about every bad science fiction clich챕 going : space storms , anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek ; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes ( in reality from any one planet , all other bodies , even their own moons , are just points of light ) ; a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years ; two-thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button . To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door . In a contemporary setting , you 'd have to explain * why * it was bullet proof , but because it 's " " science fiction " " you don 't have to ! Overall , Burton 's most disappointing film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this as a kid , before it had been yanked from the rotation , and even then it left a bad taste in my mouth . There were some competently worked out gags , but making slapstick villains out of American citizens who 'd been interned in camps strictly due to their race was amazingly tasteless . Moe himself might have wanted this one buried . He was a liberal guy . In his autobiography he told of visiting a town in the segregated South , where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close . Moe stepped into the street to show it wasn 't a problem , and the man then got back on the curb . Then off again . Finally , the man told Moe nervously that if Moe didn 't stop trying to share the sidewalk with him , he might get them both lynched.Another thing : There are exploding ostrich eggs but no oxen in the film , so the title should actually be ( if anyone cares ) " " The Yolk 's on Me .

" With this movie I was really hoping that the idea was to make up for the hashed together ineptitude of the first AVP , and yet to my horror : Requiem is far worse than I could have imagined.My hopes were up in the opening moments of the film inside the Predator ship , and I almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the Predator home world ( a throwaway digital matte painting , but still nice to finally see it ) and then of course , the humans ( if such poorly written characters can be referred to as such ) are introduced ... One must wonder why it seems to be impossible for Fox to make a good film out of Aliens and Predators . At the very least the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework.Characters are set up in the same manner in which we would expect from the worst Friday the 13th Sequel . The pizza delivery scene was cringe inducing as was every other scene of character interaction that followed it . Bimbos and teen non actors do not make for a REAL film , they make for a cheap flick , and Alien 1-3 and the Predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept ( remember that the 1st Alien is a " " B " " movie done as an " " A " " movie ) The Strause brothers really missed an opportunity , that could have been rectified by simply knowing their Alien + Predator roots : In both the Alien and Predator films we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group ( Alien : Refinery workers , Aliens : Marines , Alien 3 : Convicts and in the Predator films we generally follow a main hero part of a unit ; Predator , Arnold--Special forces , Predator 2 : Danny Glover , Police ) and it 's easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises started to go wrong : in Alien Ressurrection we have pirates ... or something , AVP we have ... explorers ? ... with guns ? ? and of course in AVP-R we have teen slasher clich챕s . What is there to identify with here ? In concept the idea of a convict returning to a small town and a war vet returning seemed a set up for a First Blood type of action hero , but like many things it was never paid off.The Film-making is equally devoid of rhyme of reason . There is no sense of forward momentum to the action , just small sequences that build the most minuscule levels of tension or interest only to cut away just when they 're getting interesting ... taking the audience out of the movie at every turn . The action scenes themselves , though much ballyhooed in the trailers , are so darkly lit , it is literally impossible to tell what is going on during the fight scenes when they finally occur . Basically , the movie is hindered from many levels . Bad actors combined with poor direction and an atrocious screenplay ( which as a screenwriter myself I noticed , seemed to hit every wrong note and clich챕 that only the most untalented writer devoid of ideas could have hashed together ) The WRITING , if it can be called that , is not even direct to video quality , nor does it demonstrate a shred of respect for the established lore of the previous entries in the series . Why does the Predalien all the sudden have the ability to shoot alien embryos down a pregnant woman 's throat to use her as an incubator for chestbursters ? More than likely because the brain dead screenwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight ( and given the accelerated growth time even more so than the first AVP : as quickly as possible . Why must meaningless small talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks ( meaning the supposed characters ) substitute for real character development ? ( Remember a character is defined by what they DO , not SAY ) . Why is the Sheriff leading civilians to a cache of guns ? ( isn 't he an officer of the law ? ) How does the bimbo of all people know where they are ? Why does the Predalien wait for the Predator to VERY SLOWLY remove his mask before it attacks ? Why are the aliens still falling into that nasty series-post-Alien 3 habit of hissing all the time to let their prey know to run ? How on Earth did this series devolve to a character saying " " People are dying ... we need guns ! " " ( how this writer even works is beyond me , and reflects badly on Fox 's already destroyed artistic reputation . It 's like everyone involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental impairment or really are that inept at every level of the film-making process . The EFFECTS are pretty lousy this time around . The Aliens look like men in suits and ADI is just getting lazy with their creature design . The Aliens look like modified leftovers from Alien Resurrection , with that same bulky musculature around the arms as if they did not learn from that movie that it was not a good design , nor a good one to recycle . Again , everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere , but simply to hide how bad the creatures look . And just like in AVP , Stan Winston is sorely missed when the fake looking Predator face is revealed.There are too many faults to list so I will just say this : Do not waste your money on this movie . Fox is beyond caring about the fans , as this cheap and trashy film is clearly evidence of . I felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see it ( though it was free ) and apologized to her profusely after . This is one die-hard fan who is done with the franchise.Note to Fox : What we really wanted wasn 't a mindless slasher flick , it was a film adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook , which was better than anything you 've produced for this franchise post 1993.Signing off . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

For one thing , it was filmed on location in Colorado ( was it Breckinridge or Telluride ? I can 't remember , but it is in the credits ) . The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular . It 's beautiful , even to me who lived in Colorado for several years.Next , it has Disney 's penchant for wonderful character actors . Harry Morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a Disney movie . He is literally hysterical . Also , remember the wonderful Mary Wickes ? Although she has a " " bit part " " in this movie , she is great , as always . If you don 't know who she is , think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback from Notre Dame ( she was one of the gargoyles ) , and she was also the most interesting nun in " " Sister Act " , " as well as the best nun in " " The Trouble With Angels . " " She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve.In addition to character actors and all-star casts , in the 1960s-1970s Disney may have not had the " " greatest " " movies , but , if you really watch some of them from beginning to end , you will NOTICE that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it . The entire movie may not be funny , but there is always a comic gem ( at least 1 or 2 ) in every single " " live-action " " movie Disney ever made . Whether it 's Harry Morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice , or Tim Conway floundering around , or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror , it is all good . The whole film may not be good , but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney film from this period that I have ever seen . Disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile , despite the dumbness of the film.Bsed on these comments , I disagree with viewers who say every Disney movie in this time period is awful . That statement it not quite accurate . Rather , it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots.Some live-action Disney movies are true classics ( Old Yeller , Bedknobs and Broomsticks , Mary Poppins ) , but for those that aren 't , I am able to appreciate them for what they were -- good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar , crude and offensive . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I had the unlucky experience of stumbling upon a preview for this movie and thought it might be interesting . I am a fan of the two main actors , and I even find Meatloaf to be oddly appealing , but that couldn 't compensate for the droning plot of this movie . This movie attempts to make social comments and be artfully intelligent . I am sure the audience gets the sociological message clearly , but has to suffer in the process . Personally , no matter how bad the movie is , I can 't stop it in the middle . Something drives me to finish the worst of movies , but I often regret it . This is one of those ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting . I never had to read this book ( thankfully ) , or it would have been a painful experience . I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn 't worth my time , or my friend 's . I think this story is not worth telling . It 's like saying that old people have a past before they got old ( no kidding ) . The lives of the main characters were painful to watch , one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes . However , I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story . I 've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn . I 'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given , which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First of all , I wasn 't sure who this film was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn 't understand and find boring . There wasn 't really much to it , Bruce Willis wasn 't stretched as an actor at all . He did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his - unless you are a big fan of his I wouldn 't bother . And if it 's the story you 're interested in ( guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child ) , I would go to see About A Boy . It has everything this film lacked , humor , sadness and reality . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" HAH ! So this is the movie that the " " Next Action Stars " " were getting into . Well I 'm glad that I didn 't participate and didn 't win ... Isn 't it funny how one can just look at the first 10 seconds ( ! ) and make up ones mind about a movie ? I mean , come on ! Just look at those titles ! ? I watched this movie ( or part of this " " teleplay " " since it was produced for TV and we couldn 't bear to watch the whole thing ) one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodge-podge of average guys that once in a while watch series like Las Vegas just for the girls in the show. so the bar wasn 't really high , the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door ( and it wasn 't because of the great script ; D . But this movie 's total lack of originality , acting , scripting , and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to Las Vegas ( or was it CSI ? don 't remember ... ) without any complaints by the rest of the group . And that is rare ( ! ) For heavens sake ! Don 't by this movie ! If it 's on TV , then yes , watch it . And contemplate on it . My conclusion ? well , since Joel Silver has indeed produced some of the best action-films out there ( Die Hard , Matrix 1 , to name some ) I can only say that producers don 't give the film it 's quality , they provide money for the directors . And to sell this movie just because it 's a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Bland ' is probably the word I 'd use to try and start describing this film . I only watched it because it had a good rating on here and i was SO let down.Basically the film is about racism in a post 9 / 11 America and the director went at it with a sledge hammer ! There was no subtlety in the film at all and it felt as though they were trying to achieve a kind of Magnolia feel to the film - which is never a good idea as that film was three hours of tedium and confusion only for it to start raining frogs at the end ... All in all a HUGE disappointment . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The biggest and most disconcerting things of the Raptor movie was ending for the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult . The similarities to the Carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line . The only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep . Then the plot went down hill from there . Would have been nice if a different plot had been devised , rather then cloning the earlier movies . The raptor movie should have taken lesson from Jurasic park series in various plots . The only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie most recently is Aztec Rex . The repeated scenes as if taken from the Carnosaur movies leaves a person thinking of those movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What a great word " " re-imagining " " is . Isn 't that what they call Dawn of the Dead MMIV ( 2004 ) ? A clever word indeed - it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate , " " remake " " that is , and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination . Well , damn , was I misled . At least I was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of " " re-imagining , " " though it played a role.Still , why make a remake ? Directors do it for only a few reasons really : to update a movie for a modern audience , or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it . An homage , if you will . Nonetheless , it all generally ( I do admit exceptions ) boils down to one thing : stealing someone 's idea and reshaping it ( or " " re-imagining " " it ) so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it . It 's like Coles ' / Cliffs ' notes ; dump everything in a blender , purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors . In other words , a great marketing scheme.So what 's wrong with this one ? Well , I 'll start with what I liked . I liked the opening scenes . Thanks to CGI and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust Romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means . We see the city in ruins , thousands of zombies : chaos and death . Two words that look beautiful on screen . Then it all falls apart.This set-up leads nowhere . The movie does what almost every remake does . It adds more of everything except character , atmosphere , and story . It 's noisier , ( in some sense ) bloodier , and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots . The setting , the mall which played a crucial role in the original film 's story and theme , is purely coincidental . The idea communicated in Romero 's film , the pure ecstatic joy of having " " a mall all to yourself as a fortress , " " is gone here . Further , this " " re-imagining " " has no moxie , no spirit , no balls . It assumes ( probably quite rightly ) that the audience has no attention span and doesn 't bother to get us interested in the characters or the story . The film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original . You actually grew to care about those people in Romero 's version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall . Here , you don 't care when or who goes : what matters is how they go.What else is their to say ? The film is not scary . It has one or two " " jump " " scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects . As a story it 's really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it . The humor is also reduced to a few one-liners ( and one really good character : Andy ) . After that , what remains ? An ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued , inevitable ambiguity of the original film . But , despite it being a pretty bad film ( though not quite as bad as some other remakes ) , it should be remembered for one thing : it kicked The Passion of Christ from it 's number one spot in the box office . Well done zombies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together . I wouldn 't call it a movie , it 's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished , illogical stories , which are not all that funny . There 're several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning , and they just disappeared from the story . He 's just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1 / 2 hours . I left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy.I think this movie is just an extended version of " " Hitch " , " padded with a lot more characters and dancing.If this is the best movie that this couple has ever made , then I 'm pretty sure I 'm not interested in any of his previous ones . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was without a doubt the worst movie I have ever sat through . And that 's saying alot , because I 've seen my share of horrible movies.But I have never seen a movie in which every single character portrayed was an unintelligent loser . Seriously , there was not one respectable character in the entire script . How fitting that the plot was equally lame , lacking any intelligence whatsoever.I can 't believe that Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz would even consent to participating in such stupidity . And while I haven 't seen all of their other movies , I 've always enjoyed their performances until now . It 's not that the acting was bad , just the entire story line was moronic . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A clever overall story / location for a story . Action is respectable . The children are annoying and their motivation is unclear .

" For all of the hype about this film , I kept an open mind as to what I would ultimately think . And , although a bit slow at times , the first 90 % of the movie is quite good , with more than a few " " old time " " scares that make one jumpy and unsettled . I actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes . Where Dark Remains fails , however , is in its climax . The ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be MILES APART from its body . The storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and , the answer I was seeking most - what REALLY happened to Emma ? - was not elucidated upon ! The rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best , and in the end , I felt very cheated . What could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Godfather Part I was a stunning look inside the fictional Corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of . The Godfather Part II shows that young man 's acceptance of his new role , his desensitization of character , as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime . The first two parts of this saga of this transformation of Michael Corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history.Then , along came The Godfather Part III . Michael Corleone is now the aging Don of the Corleone family . He shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors , but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others . Very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is Michael Corleone . Michael 's plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies . Michael 's daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to Michael realizing that his entire life as Don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in : protecting his family.The Godfather Part II ends with Michael Corleone reaching the lowest of the lows : having his own brother killed . Before Part III was made , the Godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man 's journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of Michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him : family loyalty . Part III paints the picture of Michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance . This greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films.The Godfather Part III is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made . The only solution to the problem that is this final installment of The Godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with Michael 's shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It seemed a tad empty , and my summary title says it all about the effects . Proper green screens weren 't used for this movie ... backgrounds were added in after which just looked terrible .

" How many more of those fake " " slice of life " " movies need to be made ? Hopefully not too many.Raising Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood . Nothing wrong with that in general . What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich챕 in the book of supposedly " " edgy " " Hollywood independent production.It 's supposed to be " " real " " so left shake the camera " " documentary style " , " except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose ... It 's " " edgy " " so let 's not waste any time lighting the film.It 's " " hip " , " so let 's have the children use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface ... And so on , and so forth .

Never waste your time with this picture ... I really don 't know what the director was thinking after seeing the final cut of this movie but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to look on them . The ' latex cat women ' fighters were like sheep just rolling around the scenes and looking frightened around like they had no clue what to do on the scene ...

" Cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating ( except for the dragon prop ) . Now just how did the long-gone studio known for Chuck Norris movies ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place ? Case in point : the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution . They actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundreds of lusty bimbos , just to make this look even better . For the two " " Barbarian Brothers " , " they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land . This is the single greatest waste of potential I 've seen from an " " expensive " " low-budget movie , and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print without mercy . All of this followed an advertising campaign that sold T-shirts based on THE BARBARIANS ! The movie alone makes a great souvenir ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon starts in Switzerland as the world 's foremost detective Sherlock Holmes ( Basil Rathbone ) outwits the Nazi 's & manages to smuggle a brilliant scientist named Dr. Franz Tobel ( William Post Jr . ) out of the country & to the relative safety of London . But is London as safe as Holmes thinks ? Dr. Tobel has engineered a revolutionary new bomb sight that will change aerial bombardment forever & he has agreed to give it to the British government , but those Nazi 's want it just as badly & Holmes arch enemy Professor Moriarty ( Lionel Atwill ) plans on stealing the secret of the bomb sight & selling it to the Nazi 's . Add the bumbling Inspector Lestrade ( Denis Hoey ) of Scotland Yard , Dr. Tobel 's love interest Charlotte Eberli ( Kaaren Verne ) , assassins , mysterious scientists & a puzzling coded message & Holmes has his work cut out to keep Dr. Tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight ... Directed by Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen Holmes films made between 1939 & 1946 to feature Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson . The script by Edward T. Lowe Jr . , Scott Darling & Edmund L. Hartmann is based on the short ' The Dancing Men ' by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle & isn 't the tradition Holmes murder mystery as it 's more of a wartime adventure story . To neglect what Holmes is all about , the solving of complex crimes & mysteries is a big mistake as far as I 'm concerned & the involvement of the Nazi 's & the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place , awkward & just didn 't sit too well with me . The dialogue isn 't great , Professor Moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they couldn 't come up with a villain for it & as a whole it 's far less engaging than other 's in the series . However , at least it 's short.Director Neill does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack & bear in mind that it was made over 60 years ago . It has no real style or imagination & lacks both atmosphere & intrigue as well.Technically the film is OK if unspectacular , the black and white cinematography is fine although I understand that a computer colourised version is also available . The acting is alright , Bruce & Hoey do their usual comic relief turns & Rathbone 's hairstyle in this looks ridiculous & I 'm glad he changed it for later instalments.Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series , there is very little by which I can recommend it & everything that made the other 's so good seems to be missing here . Leave this one till last & watch some of the better ones first , for die hard fans only . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" 8 days no script that 's what the DVD tells you is how the movie was made . It 's shot in blurry video that 's occasionally used to good effect , but it 's really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the running time .

But the killer only shows up once in a long time and the girls / women sit and mope they don 't try to escape or do anything too interesting , so the whole thing grinds to a stand still after about 20 minutes . Would have been a good short maybe even powerful . Even for eight days they do very little . Why ? Because they had no script . How many movies have been made without scripts . Not too many . I wonder why that is ? How many great movies have been made from bad scripts . Not too many . Why is that ? Working against this major problem , the direction tries and does some interesting things but with what is essentially nothing . Topless girls shot in dark grainy colorless video sitting around will keep some going for a while but not for the short but too long feature length . Actors again deserve praise , if only there was a script.Also the video quality , or lack thereof , is really low end , they try to use it to advantage and at times some shots look they are from Miami Vice , the recent movie that is .

" Blind Date ( Columbia Pictures , 1934 ) , was a decent film , but I have a few issues with this film . First of all , I don 't fault the actors in this film at all , but more or less , I have a problem with the script . Also , I understand that this film was made in the 1930 's and people were looking to escape reality , but the script made Ann Sothern 's character look weak . She kept going back and forth between suitors and I felt as though she should have stayed with Paul Kelly 's character in the end . He truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle Neil Hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time . Paul Kelly 's character , although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved Kitty ( Ann Sothern ) as opposed to Neil Hamilton , while he did like her a lot , I didn 't see the depth of love that he had for her character .

" The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie I 've yet run across . You would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie . Acting 혯 Bad . Editing 혯 Bad . Direction 혯 Bad . Special Effects 혯 Bad and Laughable . Plot 혯 Bad . Lighting 혯 Bad . Cinematography 혯 Bad . Costume Design 혯 Bad and Silly . Everything Else 혯 Bad . Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal . Even for a fan of bad movies , it 's a real endurance test . This is one for either masochists or Lou Ferrigno completists ( if any exist ) .Eight things I learned from watching The Adventures of Hercules : 1 . If you don 't have the budget for real special effects , rotoscope a scene from the previous movie . It will look great - trust me.2. When on a quest to recover Zeus ' thunderbolts , take time for frequent stops to oil-up you body . It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions.3. Any sword fight , use of magic , and just about all other day to day activities in ancient Greece created a sound very similar to a game of Pac Man or Asteroids.4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed like extras from Star Wars.5. If you need to pad your crappy movie 's runtime , extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music . It also helps if you 've got a previous movie to pull scenes from.6. Fight scenes move along much smoother if the bad guys attack Hercules one at a time.7. William Berger did anything for money.8.

I think because I keep looking back and thinking " " yep still in that tree ... still looking at the water " . " Poor character development . I felt nothing when they were in danger . I was voting for the croc . I found it hard to believe a croc would try to tip a boat in the first place and then when it jumps into the boat I find that really unlikely as well . The croc seems too supernatural at times ( ' all knowing all seeing ' ) . Also when the croc attacks it 's behavior seems very unrealistic .

There is a scene , where Anne is asked : " " Why you seem so careless ? " " The correct answer is , because she can 't act . No matter what happens ( the world is about to be destroyed , her friend is dying , she is fired ) , she has the same stupid grin in her face.It is not only the movie , which is B -quality . It is also the back cover description ( at least in Finland ) . The text mentions things like Lorica Gray -vessel , Capital -vessel and main character Garrison Harper and Anna ( not Anne ) Fletcher .

I rented the movie especially for Willem Dafoe and was sad it wasted his talent . I do not believe Giada Colagrande has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture .

" Young couple on the road , minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight . Yet , suddenly , they 're being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pick-up truck . Hmm , where have I seen this premise before ? Oh yeah , now I remember , we 've seen this a THOUSAND times before already , and approximately nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than " " Rest Stop " " ! This weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans , as it doesn 't feature a single original twist or memorable gimmick . It 's very sadistic and nasty , but every teenkill-slasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays , so that 's no real surprise anymore , neither . The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots . Writer / director John Shiban damn well realized that the ultra-thin basic storyline nearly wasn 't enough to fill a whole movie with , and thus he stuffs up his film like a Thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material . Nicole 's boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in California . Killing off her character right away wouldn 't result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks , suffers from visions ( ? ) in which she talks to the deranged killer 's previous victims and she has deeply emotional ( and boring ) conversations with a police officer who just won 't die even though a truck ran over him ... twice ! The dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and they 're definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movie 's length I 've ever seen . Instead of all the pointless padding , Shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable . Jaimie Alexander 's character Nicole is an annoying and brainless girl , and you won 't really care whether she 'll survive the ordeal or not . Her boyfriend Jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still weren 't painful enough , if you ask me . I counted exactly three sequences , all including torture and gratuitous mutilation , that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face . That 's still way too few for a nowadays horror movie . Basically , " " Rest Stop " " is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like " " Wolf Creek " " and " " Hostel " , " but you 're better off watching the originals . This was the first film of the new production company called ' Raw Feed ' . They 're promoting themselves as the new name in great horror , but they 'll have to come up with something much better than " " Rest Stop " " if they want us to believe that . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Their slapstick always seemed angry rather than funny , and even though it was obviously fake , their antics always seemed more likely to cause hurt rather than to cause laughter . In this short , the slapstick revolves around the attempts to find Shemp ( who is a Professor of Music in this ) a wife , because he 's just inherited half a million dollars on condition that he marry within 48 hours of the will being read . One of his students is interested , but once word of the inheritance gets out , there 's suddenly a long line-up of potential brides , and a pretty good cat fight emerges between them . Fans of the Stooges will enjoy . For me , it has all the elements that drive me nuts about them . 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release , in a justifiably empty theater . Believe it or not , after decades of watching movies , this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time ; or at least the worst that I would allow myself to watch.The acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of drunken high-school students yanked off the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less.After the first shock of disbelief , we laughed for a while as each scene hit new lows . But after a while , even that dubious pleasure wore off and it just got to be really sad . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Jesus Christ , I can 't believe I 've wasted my time watching this movie . I only watched because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd . But watching this film almost put me off her . This is absolutely awful ! I could have been watching Survivor Series 93 over this.The lead guy in this was so bland and generic . I would love it if the great Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove ' 91'd his ass through a glass window . I was enraging every time he was saying " " lake " " and " " cabin " . " I 'd kick his ass.Jordan Ladd , on the other hand , was absolutely wonderful . A true angel . But she couldn 't even save this utter joke of a film . Sadly , she couldn 't even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug . It looked hilarious.I also loved the bit where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her . It reminded me of a time where ... nevermind.Anayways , do watch this film because of it 's awfulness . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal , you saw in-jokes all over the place . If you know anything about porn , this mock documentary will leave you cold . Everything in it rings false.Spinal Tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top . This film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real world.The acting here is uniformly awful , but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good .

" Distasteful , cliched thriller has young couple doing cross-country research on America 's most infamous murder sites , becoming road partners with a dim-witted young woman and her snarling boyfriend--who is an actual psycho .

" Terrible film made on a budget of about $ 9.99 . Very obvious miniature sets used , poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship . The film contains some blood ( not enough to disturb ) and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands . ( Yes you read that correctly . ) One saving grace was a song performed at the " " talent show " " ( how 's that for irony ? ) by a punk / new wave band that I think was called " " I 'm A Heat Seeking Missile " . " Other than that , this is not worth your time , not even on a " " so bad it 's good " " level . Watch if you are into cheesy alien films , but anyone else should steer clear .

" I don 't give much credence to AIDS conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized . In the early years of the AIDS epidemic , the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies . This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of San Francisco . The city , renowned for its beauty , has rarely appeared uglier than in this film . A sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene.While the acting and plot can 't be said to be well-done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss . Actually , I found the most interesting performance to be Irit Levi as a crusty and cynical Jewish , lesbian ( ? ) police detective . She 's interesting , though not necessarily convincing.Highlights : the film 's use of the garishly tragic Turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist , Ron Athey . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I have read the whole ' A wrinkle in time ' book and then saw the movie . The movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting.A wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg , Charles Wallace , and Calvin must team together to find Meg 's father and get off the island Camazotz . The beginning of the film is really a stinker . The acting is awful , the direction is laughable , and so far the situations aren 't necessary . I really was crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle that wrote the book and created the movie , made a great book , and a terrible film . The acting is worse than any straight-to-video acting . Yes , I got to admit there was cool effects . But seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible . If you read the book you will be crushed by the movie . I wish could give it a 0 but sadly I can only give it 1 . A half could have been useful . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Anyone can make a movie these days . Budget , production value , or experienced crew don 't have to stop the self described " " director " " from " " realizing their dream " " these days.Respect for the craft of film-making , or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film.Director Bill Cowell must have thought he struck gold when Lion 's Gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with.I personally find Lion 's Gate far , far more in error than Cowell in regard to Dark Harvest 2 being made available to the public . Lion 's Gate 's deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney general 's office and Lion 's Gate 's officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film , film-making , and good sense.As for the film itself , it 's not even worth commenting on . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Derek 's have over the 1980s produced a few decent bids to acquire the title " " worst movie of all time " , " and this is probably their prime achievement in these stakes . In fact , this film can be regarded as belonging to the " " so bad , it 's good " " category , right up there with the products of the likes of Edward Wood Jr. or Doris Wishman . This explains the IMDb voting pattern for this film with some people handing out top marks.Anthony Quinn made the odd dodgy film in his time , but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad , it has to be seen to be believed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a student film and it 's a piece of crap . I would use much stronger language to describe it but then the review wouldn 't be posted and the world needs to know- beyond any possible reasonable doubt- this movie REALLY SUCKS.There seems to be a different ruler used when measuring an already famous director 's early work . Like somehow it was genius that we were just too stupid to comprehend since he finally got it right now today . I 'm not buying it . The early movie " " Bad taste " " made by the LOTR Peter Jackson 's sucks and this " " early work " " from another famous director really sucks the same way too . These " " early works " " are representative of crappy everything , from budget to scripts to actors etc .. it all is bottom of the bucket trash . Don 't be fooled by the big name.If you like watching a handful of male 70 's hippie burnouts pretend they could ever command a ship with the worst special effects you have ever seen- this is your movie.I can 't f * 37449ing believe this thing won a golden scroll award for best special effects .

" There 's something intriguing about disaster movies . The simple , primal premise can lead to several great stories . Granted , most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but I can usually live with that.Unfortunately , Flood probably marks the low point in the history of this sub-genre . Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie , even though screen time is split between different locations and characters . He gives a barely decent performance . As well , Joanne Whalley is very uneven . Veteran actor Tom Courtenay ( he played in Doctor Zhivago for heaven 's sake ) is particularly bad . I mean , his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor . What an embarrassing performance for that man . The rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception : Jessalyn Gilsig , whom I thought might be there as a plot device / eye candy gives by far the most convincing performance . Doesn 't mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared.The script is really bad , confusing and clich챕 . Some of the worse lines I have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the other.You 've seen this story a thousand times . It employs every dramatic hook and tear-jerkers you 've seen in " " Outbreak " , " " " Armageddon " , " the Poseidon movies ( original and remake ) and many others.The direction is awful . No sense of timing , nothing inspired . The shots are bland , dialog and action both fail to flow . Editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess ? Without a doubt , this movie tried to rely way too much on ( rather poor ) CGI . The human factor , the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over . Scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done . The made-for-TV feel gives nausea . Some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter ? No problem , let 's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cut / editing job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground , in the most obvious way possible.The movie score is rather poor . All over the place , no timing.The ending is probably the worse I have seen in quite some time . Very much like they ran out of ideas . Scrap that , you can 't run out of something if you never had it in the first place . Must have ran out of budget.This is a really amateur job . I give it a 2 for using London as a location , which is a nice change , for Gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few CGI shots that were decent ( those of the water closing in on London and the gates ) .Do yourself a favor and check out Day After Tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one . This includes older classics like The Towering Inferno . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well , I got and saw this movie based on the rather high score here ( 7.1 now ) , and some of the good reviews . Usually IMDb is a good guide when it comes to score , though in this case I was very much deceived.The movie is a present-day detective story , with Vinnie Jones as the investigator journalist , who investigates the death of a construction worker . Mixed with this is a made up Dickens ' novel ( called The Riddle , set in the 18th or 19th century ) , which also deals with a murder story . Both story lines are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript.Sounds interesting ? It could have been , however this movie horribly fails in a number of areas : 1 ) Acting . Mediocre at best , but it is watchable . No worse than your average UK sitcom , though for a movie one expects a little better . Especially with a score of over 7 . 2 ) Music . The music used is simply horrible , it distracts and it is annoying . Especially the pub music , and the music which plays in the journalist 's apartment . 3 ) Storyline . This is a big joke . There are gaping plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it 's almost funny . Furthermore , without going into any detail , I can safely say that the ending is absurd , and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year . 4 ) Camera-work . At times camera positions and views are distracting , and serve absolutely no purpose to the " " story " . " I 'm a bit of a movie fanatic , and watch on average 1 to 2 movies a day , but this is easily the worst movie I 've seen in months . Don 't waste your money or your time on this rubbish . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen .

" Tyrone Power was cast in the lead as Solomon . However , part-way through the film he died unexpectedly . The studio chose to cast Yul Brynner in the lead and re-shoot the scenes that Power had done . In hindsight , considering how awful this film was , Power was lucky--as this would have been a horrible way to end his lovely film career ! ! ! Of all the Biblical epics I have seen , this one is by far the worst--and that 's saying a lot because Hollywood has made many dull Biblical tales--so many you wonder if the creation of these films was an Atheist conspiracy ! ! In fact , the film was so dull that it deservedly was included in Harry Medved 's brilliant book " " The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time " . " There are so many reasons to hate the film but the worst is how incredibly ponderous the whole thing was ! Sure , casting people with Italian , Eastern European , Scottish and English accents to play Egyptians and Israelis was pretty bad--but at least this made the film oddly humorous . Having bosomy Gina Lollobrigida playing the role of a woman reputed to have come from a place around Ethiopia was also just awful , but at least she was beautiful even if she couldn 't act . Having an overweight and post-middle aged George Sanders play such a young role was also pretty bad , but at least he had a pretty voice . Creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and revoltingly dull was pretty bad , but at least you got to see in the credits a mention of a person as the " " orgy choreographer " " ! No , the worse thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours , it seemed like nine it was so poorly paced and insipid ! Considering that the only mention of this Queen of Sheba and Solomon is only in a few measly verses in the Old Testament , it 's amazing the film just went on and on and on . THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD was a bit longer , but that movie was based on four gospels--not a dozen or so verses ! The bottom line is that the film is wretched in practically every way ( except for Gina 's cleavage ) . Even for devoted Christians and Jews , this is a must-avoid film because it plays so fast and loose with the truth as well as injects an amazing amount of sex into a Biblical film ! ! ! Terrible in almost every way , it is truly a blessing for Tyrone Power that he 's not remembered for starring in this bloated turkey . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" World War I gets a glossy , sepia-tinted makeover in Jean-Pierre Jeunet 's relentlessly whimsical " " A Very Long Engagement " . " Jeunet 's trademark style consists of mechanical , almost clockwork-like narrative construction garnished with lavish , chocolate box production values and seasoned with faux-naive humour . It 's an approach that worked pretty well with his previous picture , the romantic fantasy " " Amelie " , " thanks in no small part to the inimitable contribution of Audrey Tatou in the title role . Applied to vastly more sombre material , Jeunet 's method backfires rather badly.Tatou crops up again here in a variation on the same sort of sweetly off-beat character as Amelie . She 's Mathilde , an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting , determined to trace what became of her child sweetheart Manech ( Gaspard Ulliel ) , several years after he went missing in the War . Manech was one of five soldiers court-martialled for self-mutilation in 1917 at ' Bingo Crepuscule ' , and sent over the top into no-man 's-land as a punishment . He 's presumed dead by all but Mathilde who cherishes the hope of finding him . The film follows Mathilde 's dogged quest to find out what really happened , and as she delves deeper she uncovers a sad , even shocking story of high-ranking corruption and inhumanity . Mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various conflicting , overlapping or incomplete accounts of what seem to be Manech 's final hours.All this should be poignant and gripping , but it 's more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal clutter with which Jeunet pummels his audience . There 's simply too much going on at any one time , including an intrusive narration that adds precisely nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters . Without a moment 's respite from informational overload , I felt denied the space to reflect on Mathilde 's quest or the room to engage with it on my own terms . Jeunet 's unceasingly busy camera spirals and swoops and circles , caressing every surface contour of his exquisitely designed production , but it singularly fails to penetrate to the soul beneath the story 's skin . The result is deeply uninvolving , and worse , grotesque . The First World War was a particularly dark hour in human history . Imagine it re-created as one of those picturesque commercials for a well known Belgian lager , and you have the measure of this film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Jacqueline Hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual Jackie Hyde ( co-producer Gabriella Hall ) until her boss ( Robert Donovan ) fires her for taking personal calls at work , however it 's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her Grandfather ( Malcolm Bennett ) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune ( why doesn 't stuff like that ever happen to me ? Sigh ) . Very excited Jackie heads on over there & makes herself right at home , while looking for the thermostat late one night Jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her Grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance . Being a bit on the porky side Jackie finally settles on the glamorous Jacqueline ( Blythe Metz ) , however Jackie 's better looking alter-ego starts to take control ... Written , co-produced & directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was complete total & utter crap from start to finish & it 's as simple & straight forward as that . According to the opening credits Jacqueline Hyde was ' inspired ' by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel ' The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ' , frankly if Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done to his story here he 'd turn in his grave . For a start I think Jacqueline Hyde was / is intended to be a horror film , the IMDb certainly lists it as such but there isn 't any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is . I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft-core porno than anything else & extremely tame with it , why sit down & watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard-core stuff that actually delivers the goods ? Why , that 's the question I ask here . It 's not even good porn either , besides being far too soft it 's dull , boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between . The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde ( 1998 ) title during the last century & judging by the IMDb 's plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish . This is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that 's not an excuse these days , shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy , the final ' shocking ' twist has probably the worst morph effect I 've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie 's breasts grow via more terrible CGI . That 's another thing , the film takes itself far too seriously . The subject matter sucks , is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch , alas it isn 't so it isn 't . Forget about any decent horror , violence or gore as there isn 't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff , the photography is of the flat hand held point- & -shoot variety , the music , production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script . The acting was awful , seriously this is bad.Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap , there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of . Any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap , definitely one to avoid . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen . Worse than the most abhorrent American dross ; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American dross par excellence . I can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals , and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea. it 's not . It is abject rubbish from very bowels of Satan himself ( who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it ) . Robert Jones as Exce Producer , spending our tax payers money ( lottery money folks ) on this piece of nonsense , should be accountable . Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make Deathline ? ? ? I ask you - camp as a Christmas Tree , Deathline ... ' Mind the doors ' is classic of really bad British film , we really don 't need a reminder . And we certainly don 't need a poor , second rate , badly scripted , badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this . All this this from the UK funding agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men ... I rest my case.Do Not Pay ANY money to see this . It is absolute and utter crap - the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash ... our cash ... for making it . They should hang their heads in shame.I am staggered at the low , low standard of this film . It makes me Mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting .

" At least with the teenage geek gets the girl films , the guy is usually unpopular with girls .

But then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did I miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years ? One of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them . I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent TV comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs . They 've done the gross out movies .

" Was really looking forward to seeing a continuation of Lonesome Dove but this was total garbage . Cinematography was terrible . Shot way too tight . Was almost viewing the Grand Canyon through a stationary telescope . Editing was cut , cut , cut . Not even smooth . More like a bad student editor . Don 't know if McMurtry did the screen play but the dialog was terrible . Really like Val Kilmer 's portrayal of Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp but what in heck was he doing with this character in Comanche Moon ? ? ? I have no idea . Even looked like it was shot on a sound stage using the old Bonanza sets . How can the director of the original Lonesome Dove gone so wrong with this ? Where was his head .............. Can 't say much for the acting either . It 's a shame to have messed up such a beautiful western that could have been but more like they rushed this one just to get it in the can . Have read other reviews and see that others felt the same way . Not even curious to watch the next few nights cause it would be just a waste of time like the first night was . ( 2nd post ) .................. OK , since nothing else was on TV I must be honest and admit that I watched the last 2 nights of Comanche Moon . And I will be honest to tell you that I didn 't make it to the end of either of the last 2 episodes because I fell asleep ! I can only admit that I was watching the two main characters very closely and I could pick out some mannerisms that Steve Zahn did while portraying the character that Duval did such an excellent job with . So I must give Zahn credit for that . As for Karl Urban 's portrayal .... simple dead meat . Can only say again that I was very disappointed only because I cared so much for the original LD and like others ....... have defended my feelings for a truly great western . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The biggest problem with this film is that it 's nothing like Bruce Allmighty . The first film played upon every daydreamer 's fantasy of being able to control ones surroundings as one sees fit . Evan 's experience though is entirely different . He has none of the control that Jim Carrey fools around with and instead the story centers around the power of belief . Now this would have been fine , since the first film was preaching the same message . The problem is that the sequel does it 's preaching at the expense of the comic relief . And to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into the plot . You get the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film , and it 's main objective is not to make you laugh . To sum things up this movie is failed mixture of Eddie Murhphy 's " " The Distinguished Gentleman " " and Charlton Heston 's " " The Ten Commandments " . " I 'm not sure if Steve Carrell is at fault here , you get a sense that it 's his character that limits his abilities as a comedian , the former news anchor Evan Baxter is not supposed to be funny , he 's basically an antagonist made into a protagonist which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movies message is supposed to be about . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle ( Kristin Erickson ) is found wandering around covered in dog 's blood . Her parents Ely ( Randy Colton ) & Blanche ( Leslie Fleming-Mitchell ) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter , recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other 's . Ranch hand & ex-priest Miguel ( Del Zamora ) recognises Isabelle 's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it . Blanche calls priest Jacob ( Cameron Daddo ) who is her other daughter Claire 's ( Madison Taylor ) ex husband to see Isabelle , he confirms Miguel 's suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside Isabelle & an innocent girl free ... Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism & I kept asking the same question over & over again , why do I do it . Why do I keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder ? Right lets honest about this , Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete total & utter unashamed rip-off of The Exorcist ( 1973 ) & you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share . There 's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things , the demon that uses past misdemeanour 's against other 's , the worried parents , the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor 's , the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things . I suppose where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different ( other than it 's total crap ) is that it tries to give all the character 's some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it 's so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring . The film starts with Isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either , the rest of the character 's are poorly written & fleshed out . At times I wondered whether Blackwater Valley exorcism was a spoof , there 's a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed Isabelle with horse tranquilisers & after he states that she needs a ' little prick ' he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back ! There are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect . The film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama , or it did in my opinion at least.According to some text before the opening credits Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on ' Actual Events ' , yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called The Exorcist ... This piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest . There isn 't even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up , there 's a scene of a cut arm , there 's a dead dog , someone is stabbed with a crucifix & that 's about it . There 's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive . I would imagine the only reason Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breast 's are seen . One pair of naked female breast 's is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it . There is zero scares , no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too.With a supposed budget of about $ 1,000,000 I must say that I am wondering where all the money went , the film looks ugly & cheap throughout . There are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom . The acting is very poor from all involved , genre favourite Jeffrey Combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time . Even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache & a terrible accent , he is better than this.Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete rip-off of The Exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic & the makers are thirty five years too late anyway .

" This is a movie from Toilet Pictures . If the name of the production company is any indication how stinky a movie is , then this would be it . I think I 'm not really a fan of horror movies , not that I 'm chicken , but rather this year alone , I haven 't been genuinely spooked by what 's on offer so far , be it from the West , or from Asia . 9 : 56 is no different , great premise , but poor execution , relying on clich챕d techniques ( I think these are the only tools of the trade available ? ) to try and elicit some heart thumping moments.Se-jin ( Ko So-young ) is a lonely career woman , who one day notices that some apartments in the block of flats opposite hers , undergo blackouts simultaneously at precisely 9 : 56pm everyday . No , she 's no voyeur , but a series of unexplained deaths in the neighbourhood , including one which she encounters herself on a subway , start to draw her deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding these deaths.With horror movies , there 's always a pseudo-logical explanation within the movie about how the spooks come about . That 's just about the most interesting thing that happens in the film , the unravelling of the " " Truth " , " although it won 't take seasoned film lovers to guess the plot halfway through . Which of course makes it a very unsatisfying experience watching this movie.There 's a myriad of characters like the wheelchair bound girl , and the neighbours who take turns to care for her , as well as a schoolgirl , detective , a mentally challenged boy and a spooky train commuter . But following genre formula , these folks are there usually as fodder for deaths , or in this case , pointless red herring characters whose sole aim by the filmmakers is to mislead the audience , nevermind if they convolute , or add little to forward the plot.And don 't get me started on the techniques employed here . Quick cuts , sudden appearances , long hair ghouls ( ahhhhhhh , so passe ! ) who can 't move properly , copious amount of blood like it flows down a mountain for free , and the list goes on . But credit to the sound engineers for creating some ear piercing bone crunching sounds used each time the spooks move , though it seems like a one trick pony.Don 't waste time on this , even if you 're a horror fan . It 's a complete waste of a promising premise , and in the end , you feel like you 've just be taken on a ride . A very long and painful one to endure . It 's high time for some innovation in this genre , otherwise one film will easily look like another , with ugly long haired monsters moving funny but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds . Oh , and can someone oil those doors while they 're at it as well . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview ( yes , SOS ... ) Why , you could play full-court basketball in the torpedo room , it 's so large . And how ' bout the bay windows in the bow , the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere ? Did I mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder ? And the Admiral 's stateroom with what appears to be a loft ? Big bleeping sub ... OK , OK ... it 's never gonna win any prizes for authenticity . And if the sub is laughable , the plot is even worse . Somehow the Van Allen belts of radiation , hundreds of miles in space , have " " caught fire " " are going to make global warming look like a weenie roast . Pompous Admiral Nelson ( Walter Pidgeon ) , along with his sidekick Lucius ( Peter Lorre , looking suitably uncomfortable ) hatch a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile into its midst.There 's plenty of intrigue ( sic ) along the way , with a born-again survivor ( and his little dog , too ! ) two " " dames " " who can never leave well enough alone , a passel of " " red shirts " " who are expendable , and plot holes big enough for Godzilla to walk through . Thrill to the Seaview being chased at what looks like 60 miles per hour by another sub -- no need for advanced sonar when you can follow from 100 feet astern.The movie careens from one cliff-hanger to another ; the payoff is so anticlimactic as to be pointless , certainly not worth the 1 hour and 50 minute wait.The technical adviser for this shipwreck must have been a 14-year old boy with a stack of Popular Mechanics magazines .

" From a plot and movement standpoint , this movie was terrible . I found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did . Basically , five characters appear in the movie , A Son & Father , son 's girl friend , and two male characters of the son 's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation . The movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism , but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another . There were a couple of brilliant scenes . At the beginning of the movie , the son 's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation . The photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two , ending with her admitting to having another man who was " " older " .

" I thought this movie was awful . I understand it was shot on a small budget but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just plain dumb . The plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic moron . In fact , all of the characters were unsympathetic and none were fully developed at all . The audience relates to no one in the movie . It was supposed to be suspenseful but if you don 't care about the characters , it 's hard to get " " into " " the movie at all . I felt like an outsider being forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story . All the plot twists at the end were just a little too much - I was actually laughing when I guess I was supposed to be " " shocked . " " All in all , I thought it was really just a bad movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" ' The 4th Floor ' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a problem neighbor . Jane ( Lewis ) has recently inherited a terrific 5th floor apartment from her grandmother , and per agreement with the landlord , gets a ridiculously low renting rate . Her boyfriend ( William Hurt as a creepy weather man ) wants her to move in with him , but she wants her own space . So she moves in , and weird stuff starts happening , and because this is a B-grade horror flick , there 's a dumb , not-to-be-found-in-reality reason why . As the none-too-intriguing Jane keeps trying to tell others- her boyfriend , the police , coworkers- what 's going on , everybody thinks she 's losing it . So , of course , she has to face the problem- the lunatic living right below her- alone . Neither scary nor interesting , The movie 's single saving grace is Lewis . She 's a very fine actress but poorly used here , which is not to say she isn 't the best thing about this flick- because she is . She has feral charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen of the silicone bimbos that routinely populate this type of movie . This type of movie , though , is not worthy of her- which is ironic , given that she 's probably the only reason anyone would see it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But How bad can it be you ask ? Well it was SO bad my brain started to melt & leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips . It was SO bad whenever Doug McClure came on-screen I prayed that i had flashbacks of Small Wonder ( Yes , i know Doug was in " " Out of this world " " & not " " small Wonder " , " but it 's pretty much the same damn show , & i can hum the " " small wonder " " theme better ) There are movies that are so bad they 're good. this isn 't one of thoseWhere i saw it : Showtime BeyondMy Grade : F-Eye Candy : Mako Hattori gets topless , Susan George gets 2 love scenes ( one nude , one just topless ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Arthur Miller has always been known as one of America 's great playwrights for works such as " " Death of a Salesman " " and " " The Crucible " . " " " Focus " " is one of his lesser known plays brought to the silver screen . However , knowing what a great playwright Arthur Miller is , I doubt that his original play was very much like the movie . The movie comes across as empty and formulaic , with William H. Macy as a non-Jew mistaken for a Jew by anti-Semitic neighbors in WWII Brooklyn . Don 't get me wrong : the acting is OK , and I presume that the people behind this movie were probably trying to make a point about racism , but the movie just doesn 't work . Macy , Laura Dern and David Paymer just can 't create an effective story with the material here . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" What I liked best about this flick was the chance to see Joan Woodbury , who awe-struck me as one of the several beauties in the Charles Boyer classic " " Algiers " , " in a leading role . She does well as Rita , an orphan who rises to make good as a lady crime boss . Her ascent to the top reminds me of Joan Crawford 's characters , e.g. Mildred Pierce , who realize their ambitions by fierce determination and willpower . If you 're looking for a film noir classic , better look elsewhere . At several points , it 's difficult to know where this story is going . I first got the impression that it was going to encompass Rita 's plot for revenge against the father and son who tricked her into taking the rap for a drunk driving death perpetrated by the playboy son . But payback time ended up being only a minor point , and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the film , where Rita becomes increasingly involved in city corruption . Anyway , it 's only 72 minutes , so a second viewing should clear up any haziness . My copy is from a Platinum box set called " " Mobster Movies " . " The picture quality is good , but the soundtrack sucks , constantly skipping fragments of dialog . There are eight films in the $ 5.50 box , making each movie a fair 69 cents . Look for Anne Archer 's father , John Archer , as Rita 's childhood friend Bob . Alan Ladd doesn 't get much screen time . It 's definitely Joan Woodbury 's picture . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
I was so excited to see the cast in this movie that I was completely surprised at how completely WRONG this movie was . I love John Voight but I have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this travesty . The Biblical accuracy was completely non-existent and I honestly could not stomach watching the movie with my children . My kids stood astonished because even THEY know that Lot was not even thought of when Noah was building the ark . I think that NBC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing producers to make a mockery of the Word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is ... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE ! ! !

" The Tooth Fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that lures children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives . The first few minutes introduce you to the 1949 beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switches to present day . The worn out horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid acting . They could have done without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes , but overall the gore scenes were bloody but quick which had a minimizing effect . The eye candy is pretty good for both genders . Camera work is good . Dialog is fair but cheesy . I expected the film to be a bare bones , low budget , slasher with very few redeeming factors .

There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn 't help with the major downsides to the movie . I never understand why directors ask actors / actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can 't convince . Fiennes just can 't do Irish and Fitzgerald isn 't much better at Russian . When the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing . As the for the major problem .... the plot .... was there one ? I guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that I just couldn 't wait for the film to end ... it was ridiculous . Save 90 minutes of your life and don 't watch this movie ! , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I agree with most if not all of the previous commenter 's Tom ( bighouseaz @ yahoo.com ) . The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement.I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16 ; I believe 14 has not been released on Zone 1 ( usa ) . Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing . The story line was complicated , and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous Zatoichi story lines . At one point , I was wondering if I was not seeing a remake of a previous Zatoichi film.This film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects ( a head rolling , limbs severed , blood ) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character . All the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action , and won a great following without having to resort to effects.I am just hoping that the remaining Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend . This is the first Zatoichi film from his studio . I highly recommend all the previous Zatoichi films -- and recommend them . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'll be honest- the reason I rented this movie was because I am a huge fan of Kyle Chandler 's ( most notably from Early Edition ) . Since he usually plays the good guy , I wanted to see him as in a different role ( out of curiosity ) . The plot itself also drew me in ; a wanna-be hitman ( Tony Greco- a.k.a. Mr. Chandler ) must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life- or , rather , the death- of a witness who will testify against someone in " " the family " . " The movies was nothing like I expected . It was sick , I hated the end ( if you saw it , you 'd know why ) , and there were so many unnecessary parts . Basically- it was filthy , and made little sense . Yes , it was a mob movie , and yes the guns do go BOOM . But there 's more to a movie than that . This film acted as if it didn 't have the time to go into detail- just deal with it and understand it . The acting really made up for it- James Belushi was pretty amusing as " " The Rose " . " Sheryl Lee made Angel seem as believable as she could get . She surprised me the most . And Kyle Chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to " " the family " .

" The often-reliable Leonard Maltin says this is a " " delightful romance " " and that Sanders is " " superb . " " Maltin must have confused this movie with something else . Sanders is snide and droll and superb , as usual , 혯 you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery , " " Sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three , " " 혯but dull , wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately . The storyline itself , an autobiography with Sanders as a suave jewel thief , Francois Eugene Vidocq , who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels , is entertaining enough , but it has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as * Marie Antoinette * , and certainly the deplorable * Forever Amber * ( which screams for a classy remake ) . Though , in his defense , Sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character , it is all for naught . I am an unabashed Douglas Sirk fan , but this is 1946 , and it is one of Sirk 's earliest American efforts , lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid , breast-heaving potboilers . Sirk is just getting his feet wet here , and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with * Magnificent Obsession * , and hit his stride , bombarding us with such estrogen-fests as * All That Heaven Allows * , * Written on the Wind * , and * Imitation of Life * . But * Scandal In Paris * is hardly his best work 혯 a relatively low-budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For a movie I was really looking forward to , I was very disappointed . I had no expectations of this being another Amadeus , but did expect a more significant portrayal of Beethovens last years.The performance by Ed Harris was superb , but the story line was so weak that the film simply moved from one dreary scene to the next with no continuity.The only enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the 9th , and from that point on I could quite happily have walked out without finishing.I left feeling very dissatisfied and still have the feeling that something important was missed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It 's like watching 24 hours of C-Span for the sake of comedy . It just doesn 't work . It literally falls flat at about every spot possible.Also , the movie 's animation is very poor quality . I know that this is an movie made by one person , but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap , maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny.This show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time .

" This is a made-for-TV and rather needless Sci-fi Channel retelling of the Beowulf story , especially after the recent 2005 film " " Beowulf and Grendel " .

If this is successfully accomplished , the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay . After a few failed attempts , the creature is slain , but it 's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks , leaving it up to Beowulf to , again , lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it .

" If you 're not a fan of the 80s , and you need to be a particularly strong fan , or of one of the two leads , there 's nothing about this film to recommend.The story , as others have said , is dull , almost an afterthought to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of making a slightly manic comedy . I watched it to about an hour , hoping it would turn a corner , a twist would occur or it would somehow kick into gear but no ... It 's not unwatchable , it 's just dull . It goes by . It goes by with bits of running around madly , lingering shots of feet at strange angles , bits of shouting madly but I didn 't get a real feel of energy or manic fun , it just came across as forced . Needless to say also , there was nothing to laugh at particularly . A bit of mild amusement here or there but nothing more.Don 't be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way , all it means in this case is that almost all the principal cast is female . If anything , it 's actually cloying ... Two female leads , fine , excellent , the drug dealer is female , okay , their landlord is a landlady , alright , their friends are female , okay , the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building , oh , female ... I wasn 't on the lookout for that but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to have the film cast that way and it felt , again , a bit forced and cloying.On the plus-side , if you are a fan of 80s fashions and culture , there is plenty to see and if you 're a fan of Helen Slater , she 's fun and enjoyable to watch . There 's also some screen-time for Carol Kane , which is great , but not enough ... Overall : 3 / 10 . If you 're a huge fan of the 80s , Helen Slater and Carol Kane , you could maybe stretch it to a 5 because of them , although there 's still the fact it 's a comedy which isn 't funny , which hinders it substantially .

" I am not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren . I guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent . That is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent . Some of the other reviews point out how dumb Detention is , but many neglect to point out the positives . Any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed can 't be all bad . Why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens ? Aren 't there any other kind of teens ? Does every group of teens have one angry black guy ? One genius nerd that nobody likes ? One slutty girl who is very friendly and ( in this movie ) pregnant ? One disturbed anti-social white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented ( but what is the talent ? ) . And one laid-back black kid who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him . Then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color . They don 't say much but get shot at some point . Detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school . Preferably with the writers inside . The dialogue is bad , and the plot is worse . When the bad guys ( and girl ) finally hijack a van full of drugs , then they sit inside the van making out . They drive the van to the school because they want to re-paint the van at the school 's paint shop , but they never get around to re-painting the van . By the way , it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the Police Van . They also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score . For some reason , they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher ( Dolph Lundgren ) even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours . The handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles , so why go after them ? Anyhow , the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns , and they keep finding the teens ( including a guy in a wheel chair ) and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss . Towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed . For every time someone gets shot , there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss . The stunts are pretty bad . I read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of $ 10 Million , and I am amazed . When I saw the movie I figured maybe Lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher . Like maybe this movie was their end of the year exam .

If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash . What was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways , but managed to attend every major 60 's event through the country .

" This sure is one comedy I 'm not likely to forget for a while.Wouldn 't normally bother to comment on this movie : it 's so minor that no one would watch it anyway , but as it happens , it 's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as Kazaa , and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is.So what is it then ? Well , of course it 's not really a comedy ; instead , it 's intended as a horror flick -- " " intended " " very much being the key word here . The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess , the special effects are only special in that they 're especially pathetic , and as for the acting , well , let 's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school , my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent.Of course I realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one 's expectations , certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned . Also , even though I 'm a big fan of the horror genre , I 'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting.But still.B-movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding , such as humour . The only laughs in Cradle to Fear lie in the ridiculous performances . If you can find the humour in that--and I could for the first 20 minutes or so , gradually dozing off after that--then that 's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer . Oh , that and two or three pairs of breasts.Woohoo , how exciting.As for the story , it 's not even that it doesn 't try to convey anything : the victims either use drugs and / or are involved in serious crime . The lesson : Watch out , naughty boys and girls , because one day you 'll be made to pay for what you 've done.I rest my case.So , all in all , a little bit of sex , a fair amount of drugs , but absolutely zero rock ' n roll.I rate this one 1 out of 10 , but would go to 0 if I could . Or perhaps I wouldn 't : it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors ' names correctly in the titles . I mean , that 's something , innit ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a disaster . The question is not , " " How did it get made , " " because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film , they will do so.No. The question is " " Why , oh why , did Steve Martin allow it to be made ? " " I think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything . He knew the sequel was going to be so frightful , that out of pride , he wouldn 't even count it 's royalties as income . The only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation 's favorite poor black family.And " " dcreasy2001 " " ( aka Mark Blankfield ? ) : It 's just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity , and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel 's lone cheerleader as an IMDb user comment .

" Notwithstanding that " " The House of Adam " " is meant to be a mainstream gay movie ; that Anthony ( John Shaw ) , who is gay curious and a major cutie-hunk and Adam ( Jared Cadwell ) who is openly gay , and a close second in looks ; that there is a whole minute of wonderful , convincing , and naked lovemaking ( sorry , no frontal ) between Anthony and Adam 41 minutes into the movie ( that alone may be sufficient for many of us ) --- notwithstanding all that ( to which I give a thumbs up ) , " " The House of Adam " " is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard . A big thumbs down.Shaw 's and Cadwell 's acting abilities are either sophomoric or else truly suffer from the bad script , direction , and editing , or rather the lack thereof . Their lovemaking scene is nevertheless convincing , and may have more to do with their really being into each other , considering the rest of their scripting and acting.Writer-director Jorge Amer 's ( Bonus Feature ) self-congratulation as to his movie making skills is off the wall.So , the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down . Overall , the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for Shaw and Cadwell . Alexis Karriker as Nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above . Far and away the absolute worst , and insufferable , acting was by Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross , Anthony 's father having not even of elementary school acting quality . He truly represents a colossal casting failure.The actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as well.If only the production , editing and post production were as good as the trailer , this movie would have been quite something else . The trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place . That , and the hope that this gay-centered movie , was supposedly prominently played and touted at gay film festivals.Overall , the movie is a big thumbs down.Is it worth buying / renting and watching it ? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love making scene , and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam . Or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" One of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams , rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins . One of the most serious examples in 19th century USA of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold-bearing gravely hills on the sides of the Sacramento Valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s . This process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside , causing the material to wash downhill , where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment . The sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the Sacramento River or its tributaries . The sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas . Some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields , where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult . Thus , the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by Warner.First , we might ask why Warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor Technicolor , a very rare treatment in 1938 . A story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn 't seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time . The answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors , with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations . Then , we might ask why colorless George Brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero , to be paired with Olivia de Havilland . Among other things , this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it . Even the usually colorful Gabby Hayes , in his small role , seemed unusually subdued . Unfortunately , I fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film . The portion I saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems . It needed to be more like " " The Good Earth " , " released just the year before . Just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man , such as Errol Flynn . Finally , there is the matter of the inane title . Surely , Warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title . " " Gold or Grain " " is short and to the point . Incidentally , I understand there is still plenty of gold in ' them thar hills ' , waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film was terrible . OK , my favourite film is ' The Wicker Man ' ( 1973 ) , so I was always bound to be a little biased . The plot rambles along , throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term ' remake ' highly dubious . ( He 's not a virgin , but IS allergic to bees . WOW ! ) So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained , which I 'm afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make . ( How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film ? ) Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout , and his character is prone to calling out " " Rowan ! ? " " at the slightest noise . The ' nods ' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage . For example , certain incidents mirror the original ( The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage is searching the island ) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.I 'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this , I really can 't be bothered to write any more about this film . It lacks any kind of substance . Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were ' based ' on ( in this case very loosely ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Well , you 'd better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish , bland , and pokey flick about a middle-aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like . Set in Tunis , mom piddles around the flat , gets antsy , and decides , albeit reluctantly ( she just can 't help herself ) , to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret . Meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons . The common denominator is a Tunisian band drummer . This film is so full of filler I watched the DVD at x2 and read the subtitles , fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking ( they walk everywhere ) and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring , uneventful , low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits .

" I love old " " monster movies " " for the pure camp value . This one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing.The acting is pure 1950s stilted crap . You do get used to it when you 've seen enough of these ... the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable . You 're just there for the giant bird.The " " science " " in this movie is hilarious . A monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti-matter ... intent on wreaking havoc and eating people ... an alien who has come to Earth to nest . Some of the best scenes in the movie ( that don 't have the bird in them ) include the " " scientists " " explaining what is going on.A lot has been said about the ridiculous bird marionette . It looks like a new baby bird ... bald and ugly with ruffled feathers . It even caws like a hungry , angry fledgling . However , the bird scared the crap out of my three year old , who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening . It 's a bit creepy.I was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg .

" I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie . Granted , it 's Shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not . But this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not , that may prevent many from just not caring about a Shakespeare based story.The largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters . Often during character 's interacting , it 's nearly difficult to distinguish who 's lines are who 's . Granted , I believe this movie is dubbed in English . Certainly they could 've obtained voice actors which could 've added a bit more drama to these classic , literary lines.It would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1 , although perhaps that 's based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget . Still , it 's absolutely painful and boring . If you insist on Hamlet , do yourself a favor and read the book again . 1 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" No real plot to this one , just a series of short skits acting out some VERY old jokes . I chuckled once or twice in the beginning , much to my chagrin .

" I don 't know why , but i thought i 've seen this movie before . Maybe it was the name , maybe it was the way poster looked , i don 't know . Anyway , it was quite promising in the beginning . And even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments . Maybe its because i 'm not a huge fan of the horrors , and i don 't watch them a lot , but this one actually looked fresh sometimes . But the rest of it is not so good . Laughable at times . The movie is slow paced , sometimes you will get so bored you 'd forget what was the story about . Characters are not great either . All of them . The butcher is OK , seems creepy and crazy enough . Although i didn 't get what were those weird looking things on his chest ( that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out-of-the-blue ) , and why he was collecting those in jars at home ? The main lead is plain . His character is really hard to believe in , and very undeveloped . But i guess thats scenarists fault . Like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend ? Side cast is bad too . But the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl . My god , when will women in horror movies have any brains ? Its ridiculous . The girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera , tries going to police , that fails , and then she thinks of the best idea ever . Why don 't we just go and take it ! I know where the maniac lives ! Yup ! Thats swell ! And then look for the camera in the bathroom ! Why not ? And then walk in the room , see a bag that was not there before , and just have a look inside . Maybe camera is there ? Not there . But loads of interesting stuff . Shiny . Mmmm . To realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain . Then of course the never ending " " falling while running away " " trick , that really made it look bad . Then , to put the final nail into the character , in the end of the movie , she walks into the wagon FULL with dead bodies hanging feet up , screams " " Noooo " " like she just ripped her Gucci bag , and walks further into the wagon ... Jeez . Come on . No one else thinks its just , well , stupid ? Just awful . If her character wasn 't so bad , maybe the movie would get another star or two from me . And i would even forgive MMT characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer ( that dude in the train who the conductor killed ) , butcher vests that can protect from bullets , weird and cheap looking monsters in the end ( i didn 't read Clive Barkers novel , so i have no idea where those monsters came from ) , the fact that no one cared that hundreds ( judging on the skeletons in the dungeon ) disappeared in the city , and main character that didn 't bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out ( he barely noticed it i guess ) . Oh , and the predictable ending . Damn , i knew the ending half way in , its just disappointing . The only reason i 'm still giving some credit to the makers , is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i 've watched past few months . Visual style is nice , some shots were really nice and good CGI that made the killings look really brutal . ( although blood didn 't look real at all ) I guess some people will enjoy it , some , like me , will watch it if there is nothing else to watch , some will absolutely hate it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've read a lot of reviews on the IMDb ( well , all five of the ones that have been written at the time that I 'm writing this ) and I 'm surprised at the amount of praise heaped upon The Brideless Groom , which is undoubtedly one of the lesser comedies performed by the Stooges . I prefer the older ones where it was Larry , Curly and Moe , although Shemp gets credit for most of the funny scenes in Sing a Song of Six Pants , another Stooges short which is only moderately amusing but far superior to Brideless Groom . Indeed , there is a single slightly amusing scene in the film , the " " don 't-hit-a-lady " " scene , which is barely amusing at all and is 15 minutes into the film . Not very promising in a 17-minute comedy.Shemp is a voice trainer whose uncle has passed away and left him an inheritance of $ 500,000 , provided he get married within 48 hours , which is short enough notice as it is , but by the time Shemp learns about it he has only 7 hours left . This is a premise that had been done and redone before , but was not , I don 't think , a massive clich챕 at the time this film was made , as it is now . There are a series of gags throughout the film , none of which are even close to the level of comedy for which the Three Stooges are so widely known . It seems that the Stooges have run into the same troubles that plagued so many of Shirley Temple 's films 혯 there is too little reliance on content and too much reliance just on the fact that they 're there.The standard characteristics of the Stooges are here , Moe is the mean one , whose meanness is certainly not used sparingly in this film , and the slapstick sound effects ( although with more exceptions than usual ) are fairly amusing , but are plugged into their standard slots in this film . The line " " Hold hands , you lovebirds " " is immortal . The rest of the film is not.There is much talk among the other people who have reviewed this movie for this site about this being one of the best of the Stooges shorts , that you won 't find one weak moment , about how this is their best since the early 30s shorts . It 's just not true . I can certainly understand a level of automatic respect for milestone classics and for the giants of early comedy , which the Three Stooges certainly are , but that respect is damaged when poorer films are praised more than they should be . The Brideless Groom deserves some respect because it is a Stooges film , but for exactly the same reason , it should have been better . The Three Stooges were just better than this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I was so disgusted by this film , I felt obligated to warn off others . This film has no story , plot or hint of purpose . The film starts after the standard " " lets be scary " " movie intro , which by now every film watcher has become accustomed . So we can ignore the beginning completely . We are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static . ( Unless you have seen white noise - EEK ) Acting is a DISGRACE and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came . Having said that , even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able . Their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster . Senseless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up " " eccentric " " writer , who probably considers himself to be an artist , has resulted in a film which will test your patience . It was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said , " " We have been watching this for 45 mins " " did I realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag . Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn 't the audience . Rather than suggest what the film is missing , let me tell you what it has : Dumb Blonde ( surprise surprise ) , Victims , bad-monster-guy-thing , about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours , days , weeks , months ... and credits.Want a silver lining ? Well , the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes , but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Predictable , told a thousand times story with the usual drama in between , a couple of pretty raunchy sex scenes intermingled with some character paranoia , 70 's style incidental violin horror music that is comical at times , i couldn 't help chuckling to myself.I usually like Defoe , and it has to be said that the acting is not all that bad , the " " plot " " develops at a reasonable pace and does keep you guessing from time to time . Its just that it 's all too predictable , i felt like i was watching a made for TV drama instead of a new movie . Maybe thats the style the directors wanted , but it has to be said that the review i read on here before i saw the movie could only have been written by someone involved in its production.Don 't expect too much , and if i could wind the clock back i wouldn 't have gone to see it at the cinema .

" This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day . A wealthy upper class English woman schemes , plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction .

There 's a clever sex-role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters . But naturally there 's a tall , dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest , and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man.The wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme , but those who thirst for Romance will overlook that . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie had all the elements to be a smart , sparkling comedy , but for some reason it took the dumbass route . Perhaps it didn 't really know who its audience was : but it 's hardly a man 's movie given the cast and plot , yet is too slapstick and dumb-blonde to appeal fully to women.If you have seen Legally Blonde and its sequel , then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel . Great actors such as Luke Wilson should expect better material . Jessica Simpson could also have managed so much more . Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing.Many things in this movie were paint-by-numbers , the various uber-clich챕 montages , the last minute " " misunderstanding " , " even the kids ' party chaos . This just suggests lazy scriptwriting.It should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you don 't take it seriously , but it 's such a glaring could-do-better than you 'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll past . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time , Silas Marner by George Eliot.The details of the film shown on IMDb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but I did not see this at the beginning of the film , only a credit at the end of it saying " " suggested by the book Silas Marner " . " Suggested ? It was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story : A wronged and sad old man , an artisan , poor and lonely , has all his money stolen . One night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside . The man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire ( or rich politician here ) demands to adopt the child . It is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before . The battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.In this and every other aspect of the film , the story is exactly the same . In only one can I find a difference . Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of Mr Martin too far . On top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction ( presumably to make him look younger , but actually making him look more the clown that he is ) ! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes , that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story . Like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years . This is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful ! I am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made . If I was a trustee of George Eliot 's I would insist on reparation . If I was Steve Martin I would send the profits to that estate , or to the poor . At the very least it should be entitled Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin . Or better still removed from the archives ! If you are interested in this story - and I hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch Silas Marner . Or read the book ! The BBC made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980 's . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " The James Dean Story " " is introduced as " " A different kind of motion picture , " " explaining , " " The presence of the leading character in this film has been made possible by the use of existing motion picture material , tape recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique - dynamic exploration of the still photograph . " " The only " " tape recordings of his voice " " noteworthy is one short recording Mr. Dean make while visiting his family in Indiana ; he wanted to record any family recollections of his great-grandfather Cal Dean , intrigued because he played a similarly named " " Cal " " in " " East of Eden " . " Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art , and learns the relative was an auctioneer . James Dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family , obviously . That 's the only 100 % accurate revelation in this documentary . James Dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family.An amazing " " screen test " " / " " outtake " " from " " East of Eden " " appears near the film 's end . It 's a black and white scene between Dean ( as Cal Trask ) and co-star Richard Davalos ( as Aron Trask ) . Dean is at his mesmerizing best . If this scene appeared only here , and no " " East of Eden " " film was completed , this documentary would be an essential , high rated film . But the scene , a perfect " " 10 " " in isolation , should be considered an " " East of Eden " " extra . Dean 's " " Traffic Safety Film " " is also worth seeing.There are the expected interviews with family and friends . My favorites were the guy ( Lew Bracker ) going through a box of stuff Dean left with him , and Dean 's family . There wasn 't enough from Aunt Ortense and the letter from Dean to his little cousin was very nice . More reading of Dean 's letters would have been welcome . Dean 's unidentified writer friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film ; filmmakers might have considered developing it as a main focus.Robert Altman 's direction of Martin Gabel 's reading of Stewart Stern 's script is dreadful . What were they thinking ? Perhaps , filmmakers can be forgiven due to the closeness of Dean 's passing . Don 't expect " " The James Dean Story " " at all . This movie is more about Dean 's effect on people ( both the fans and filmmakers ) than the man . It is very clearly an early piece of the James Dean myth-making " " legend " . " Tommy Sands sings " " Let Me Be Loved " . " The narrative refers to Dean as " " He " " with a god-like air . The shots of Dean 's family seeming to " " know " " the moment he dies are truly wretched . * * The James Dean Story ( 8 / 13 / 57 ) Robert Altman ~ James Dean , Martin Gabel , Richard Davalos , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Now I remember what the ' indie ' filmmakers were ripping off before Pulp Fiction . It was David Lynch , right ? I hunted this thing down to see Kyle Secor . What a waste of a perfectly good Bayliss . It was so painful to watch him , sort of like when someone you love is horribly sick and there 's nothing you can do.Nearly every cliche in the book : the desert , the psycho , the quirky mob boss , the biker , Tracy Walker ( who fortunately was only in one scene , but I kept expecting him to reappear and say something strange and profound like " " If a man wants to know where he 's going , he 's got to look at where he 's been , " " or some contrived garbage like that ) . I have a theory as to why so many indies are short on location in the desert . I think it 's because they can save money on lighting.If you like to be in pain , find this movie and give it a viewing . If you 're a fan of Kyle Secor , watch reruns of Homicide on Court TV . If you want a good , quirky road thriller , check out Wild At Heart.There is a reason that no one has heard of Delusion ! My god , what a waste of a good title . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

A martian is dropped on earth , turns into a human , befriends a human , and is trying everything he can to get back home . But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth . The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors , Back to the Future 's Christopher Lloyd as the martian , Uncle Martin , Dumb and Dumber 's Jeff Daniels as Tim O 'Hara , Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie .

" Released at a time when Duvivier was going again from strength to strength . " " Black Jack " " which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary " " Au Royaume des Cieux " " and the dazzling stunning " " Sous Le Ciel de Paris " " , is a jumble , which Duvivier himself hated , which is not surprising.There 's almost nothing to write about this dud.We can notice that : 1.Orson Welles used to admire Duvivier .That may explain why Wellesian actors were featured in Duvivier 's movies : Joseph Cotten in " " Lydia " " ( 1941 ) , and here a totally wasted Agnes Moorehead .It 's the first timeI have not enjoyed Moorehead 's performance ! On the other hand , Welles borrowed his Desdemona ( Suzanne Cloutier ) from Duvivier 's " " Au Royaume des Cieux " " for his " " Othello " . " 2.In any Duvivier 's movie , there 's one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception : the search in the caves where Duvivier 's sense of mystery works wonders ( for a short while ) ; then the chase when Dalio gets caught up in the fishnets.Duvivier 's touch can be felt in the unhappy end too.As for the rest , as my dear pen pal writer 's reign writes , it 's a black joke . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Except people apparently buy into this garbage ! As shows like " " Moral Orel " " have shown , even if you tried to make the most outrageous , over-the-top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of , it wouldn 't come close to the hilarity of this show . It 's hard to tell what 's even going on when you 're watching it . Is it a news show ? A talk show ? Who knows ! ? They start out by reporting on various international news stories , but at seemingly random points , the news is interrupted by this odd , troll-like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face , mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy.Pat Robertson doesn 't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance . He just seems like a senile , yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs ( like most of our grandparents ) . But this is a man who has called for an assassination , who has befriended and offered aid to not one , but TWO murderous dictators , who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines , who has SUPPORTED forced abortions in China , and who regularly implies that Caucasians ( straight American male Caucasians in particular ) are superior to all other races.Still , this would all be funny , except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later ( either that , or enough money to bribe some TV executives who don 't give a damn what they show ) . The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people , somewhere , must be watching it and hanging onto every word . Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is , people still listen to him . I don 't know if it 's funny or scary .

As I have the experience of seeing f18 's and f14 's being mysteriously transformed into f16 's , this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me .

In COLLISION COURSE , the pelican-faced comedian teams up with the late Pat Morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger ( think car lover Leno played a hand in the plot ? ) . The two leads try hard , they really do , but Leno is no actor and Morita 's fish-out-of-water routine gets old in a hurry .

" Yes , dumb is the word for this actress . I know many have mentioned her beauty , but this viewer found her empty headed and boring to watch with her bleached hair , lip gloss , and not so perfect body . Watch her walk away in those jeans , showing a rather large butt . Her butt spreads beyond her shoulders . What does that tell you ? As for the leading man , played by gorgeous Mark Humphrey , he was perfectly cast . A charmer . However , he and Lancaster just didn 't match . She was out of place opposite this good looking guy . Good acting by Susan Glover as the sister . Angela Galuppo had a small role and was okay . But the film 's director Philippe Gagnon , wasted too much footage on Lancaster . After a while you got tired of looking at her and watching her dull acting ability . And what a bitch of a wife she was . Snooping on her husband , being obnoxious to him and just a plain spoiled brat . Was happy to see her hit with the dart gun . I thought it might be the end of her . But alas , the script tells us otherwise . After torturing myself and watching this loser again , I still came up with the same criticism . Lancaster is boring to watch . This time around her hair , folks . Her hair constantly in her face , constantly tossing it back , became annoying . I question the writer , Alexandra Komisaruk 's reason why a good looking wealthy man like Philippe would even bother with the likes of a bimbo like Allison . When there were so many attractive intelligent women , with class , to choose . He picks this nothing . Is this the Rochester / Jane Eyre thing ? Oh well , it 's all a matter of taste , I guess .

" With the runaway success of " " God 's Army " , " every Mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now . In the case of the recent " " The Other Side of Heaven " , " this wasn 't at all a bad thing . That film , while not great , was quite good . " " The Singles Ward " , " however , is not.Telling the story of a young , divorced Mormon guy thrust back into single life , the writing and shooting style of " " The Singles Ward " " is , in many ways , very similar to the 80s comedy " " Ferris Bueller 's Day Off " . " However , the similarities end there . While " " Ferris Bueller " " was funny , original , and well-acted ( as far as stupid comedies like this ever are ) , " " The Singles Ward " " is completely the opposite . It tries very hard to be funny . However , 90 % of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you 've probably heard a million times before . The other 10 % seem to be thrown in to fill out the time . And the acting , while not awful , is amaturish at best.In addition , if you 're not either a Mormon yourself , or very , VERY familiar with Mormon culture , you won 't get hardly anything at all . Whereas " " God 's Army " " and " " The Other Side of Heaven " " were appealing to a broad range of viewers , both inside and outside of the Mormon church , this film is most definitely one big inside joke , and even if you get it , it 's just not that funny . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy . It 's hardly a comedy , rather a dull indie film about a group of losers . Supposedly set in the 70s , there is scant attention paid to period details , with overly muted color correction taking its place . The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film ( perhaps that is the point , but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience . ) Apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location , the bleachers . It seems like the packaging of the film as a comedy is meant to deceive people into renting or buying this film , which is a complete waste of time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Eghads , what a bad movie . Tart is perhaps the very worst movie I 've seen all year , and I 've run across some doozies . There is nothing redeeming about this trash , from the characterization to the direction to the plot . Even the usually brilliant Dominique Swain couldn 't save this movie . None of the characters are in the least bit sympathetic , with the possible exception of Eloise ( wonderfully portrayed by Lacey Chabert , the only bright spot in this dismal failure ) . * * * * * * * Possible Spoilers * * * * * * * * The main problem with Tart is that it rambles on without saying anything . It staggers about drunkenly instead of leading us along the path of the story . It also introduces numerous potentially tantalizing details ( the hypochondriac brother , the mother 's possessions constantly being repossessed , the anti-semitic classmate , the other classmate 's murderous father ) without successfully exploring a single one of them . And just when I finally thought that there might be some sort of resolution for the characters , the movie crashes to an unexpectedly violent end.I left the movie feeling that it was trying to tell me something , but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated . This is an obvious first film from a writer / director who really needs to spend much more time working under more established film makers before foisting any more of her work on an unsuspecting public.I gave this film 1 out of 10 , and I 'm usually very generous , even with bad films . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is the first film I 've watched from the Italian Ed Wood , Demofilo Fidani aka Miles Deem . The above title was superfluously added later on since there exists another similarly titled 1961 movie starring Richard Basehart which was Hammer Films ' Michael Carreras ' one and only stab at the Western ; the genuine Italian title was originally translated as HIS NAME WAS SAM WALBASH , BUT THEY CALLED HIM AMEN혚although it was actually WALLACH in the Italian variant which , of course , implies a tribute of sorts to Hollywood actor Eli ! While certainly not unwatchably bad , instances of clumsiness and ineptitude abound so that I was often cracking up into howls of laughter : a horrid number by a would-be irresistible French chanteuse ; a totally irrelevant bar-room brawl ; actors doing somersaults when being shot ; an aged villager doing an impromptu dance routine ; ineffective use ( indeed abuse ) of slow-motion ; and , easily the most preposterous , seeing Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate play two gunfighters ( sporting the actors ' own names ! ) hired by the villain to kill off the title character and then never having them appear in the rest of the film at all ! ! Lead actor Robert Woods is just that even down to ineffectively whispering the Amens over the bodies of his victims . Supporting actress Simonella Vitelli ( actually , the director 's own daughter ! ) as the villain 's broad is quite a looker but , unfortunately , she doesn 't get to do much in the film 혯 despite having a change of heart towards the end .

" Seriously , I don 't understand how Justin Long is becoming increasingly popular . He either has the best agent in Hollywood , or recently sold his soul to Satan . He is almost unbearable to watch on screen , he has little to no charisma , and terrible comedic timing . The only film that he has attempted to anchor that I 've remotely enjoyed was Waiting ... and that is almost solely because I 've worked in a restaurant . But I digress . Aside from it 's terrible lead , this film has loads of other debits . I understand that it 's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy , but that doesn 't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence , and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive . Lewis Black 's considerable talent is wasted here too , as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained , which the PG-13 rating certainly won 't allow . The film 's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill ( who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim ) . His one liners were funny on occasion , but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable .

" I 'd really , really wanted to see this movie , and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account . When it showed up in our mailbox , I threw it straight into the DVD player.I was very sadly disappointed , which in turn made me mad . I 'll give any movie a chance , even if I want to walk out of the theater / press ' stop ' . I watched it all the way through , but didn 't get anything from it but frustration.The acting was very , very good , but that was about it . Nothing is explained ; while we understand that Mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind , we 're never given insight to his ' downfall ' . While we understand that he and Cedric break up , again , we don 't see it happen or WHY it happened . During an interview with Mathieu 's doctor , Cedric reveals that he 'd cheated on him once , but it was no big deal . I expected to see this in flashbacks , but no--nothing . We also gets the hints that Cedric was the one to bring Mat to the hospital--but AGAIN , we don 't see it.I know some movies are a ' take it as it is ' basis , but this movie honestly ticked me off . When Pierre , Cedric 's ex shows up in the club and starts trouble , we don 't see hide nor hair of him until near the end , and it took me a good chunk of time to figure out that Pierre WAS the ex . His personality at the club and when Mat finds him are entirely different . I might even be wrong saying this , it was that confusing.The film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed , out-of-place and confusing pace . I can keep up with films like ' Pi ' , ' Citizen Kane ' and other films that have flashbacks / flash-forwards left and right , but CU didn 't capture and hold onto the style . At the end of ' Citizen Kane ' , you know what 's going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries . CU just leaves you hanging . It has an air of pretension in its ' we 're not gonna tell you a damned thing , figure it out for yourself ' presentation .

" I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967 . I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country , therefore being a fan of films considered " " controversial " " I really had to see this for myself.The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life . In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States . In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics , she has sex with her drama teacher , classmates , and married men.What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago , this was considered pornographic . Really , the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between , even then it 's not shot like some cheaply made porno . While my countrymen mind find it shocking , in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema . Even Ingmar Bergman , arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford , had sex scenes in his films.I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America .

" Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film . The acting , directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer / director / star Larry Bishop to get laid . The only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with QT . The plot of the film is pretty flimsy , and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older B-movies and some cameos from guys like David Carradine , Dennis Hopper , and Vinnie Jones . Each one is listless in their performance , particularly Hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career . The saving grace , if there is one , is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining . Bishop tries so hard to get that trademark Tarentino banter and just fails miserably , which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others . I 'd only check this one out if you love bad movies ... or if you 're really into biker films . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild , but I do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was . The cast was there to do it , but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie . The only problem was that they did not fit . I did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best . I left wondering why i spent my money on this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Don 't get me wrong , I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy . I shall digress now . The writing , though , was unrealistic . A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person . Give me a break . The smugness of very pretty Mary Louise Parkers character was an insult to my intelligence . The characters were not at all likable . Basically , the plot lines went nowhere . I understand its only TV land . The hypocrisy was blatant . Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mom and I am supposed to believe this .... WHY ? ? ? ? I just got the feeling I was being preached by a show reeking of seediness . Its like saying its OK to cheat on your wife , but with someone of legal age status . OK not exactly the same thing , but I think you people get my point .

" The following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie : 1 ) Clich챕s abound . Seriously , awful " " twists " " are everywhere.2 ) The narrative jumps around in time , which would be fine if done well , but it 's not.3 ) Lame characters that don 't develop so much as either remain utterly static , or drastically change for no good reason.4 ) Big one : HORRIBLE ACTING . Over the top from nearly every person.The following are some of the best points from the movie : 1 ) The lead is damn good looking.As I see it , there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie : a ) People who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive.b ) People who often think to themselves , " " I like Hollywood dreck rife with clich챕s and overacting , but if only I could watch it in Korean ...

He rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an " " in your face anger . " " I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and even though she is great eye candy , she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress . Luis Guzman was actually really good also , except that I disliked the change of his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film .

However , the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be , and the asylum is being run by the patients , and the doctors are in cages . First of all , some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep , and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons ( A guy who thinks he 's a chicken , for instance ) . I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good , but the film itself bombs . The music of the film is really odd and like something you would hear in some insane comedy , and yes , there is a scene involving dancing chicken men , which pretty much made me want to shut off the screen .

I normally love Jackie Chan movies but this one was terrible . There are only 2 or 3 fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less . The bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasing / racing . The car chase isn 't so bad ( though not as exciting as fighting ) but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring . Basically it takes all of things that make a Jackie Chan film a Jackie Chan film and leaves out everything except Jackie Chan . Even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humour.I suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact I saw one of those horrible dubbed versions . I usually try to see the subtitled version ... I wish I could understand Chinese.I 've only seen one Jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into Hollywood films that didn 't turn out so well.Avoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Was it really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in a documentary . And why all the silly dog scenes , and then repetition of all the same silly dog scenes ? This film starts with a great promise - to expose the international politics and the business of wine . It got off to a great start and included all the right characters . But the production is a mess . Points started and developed most of the way , then never finished or left with dangling ends . Very poor and disorienting camera work and editing . They should have used subtitles for the British mumbler from Christie 's.Too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentary.Probably honored at Cannes because of the US bashing ( although in my opinion there was too little of it ) .We left at the 2 : 00 hour mark - I have no idea how much longer it ran on . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Scary Movie 2 " " is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise . Scary Movie 1 , 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny .

Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.This movie isn 't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things .

" ( Spoilers galore ) This is an absolutely awful film . First of all it has that guy from medium . I guess he 's made a career out of playing super doting dads . It was OK the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they cloyingly did it again ! And so it goes , this film moves in excruciating real time . At one point , I started imaging it was days later , until I was reminded that the story line was only at the next day ... in the early afternoon still ! I 'm not really sure who this couple is supposed to be in real life . First of all they are presented as sort of a Manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and had a kid . But they drive an old blue Volvo . Those types stopped driving Volvos decades ago . Today they drive Priuses . But in 2002 , I 'm sure they still weren 't driving Volvos.OK , then there 's Wendigo . A " " mysterious Indian man " " gives the boy a little magic Wendigo statue and tells him of its powerful magic . C 'mon ... are we still doing ancient Indian mysteries . Just to drive it home , they pan across every Indian statue in their tourist trap upstate New York town . American Indians are portrayed in a manner not seen for decades in this film ! Oh , and about Wendigo . He is not actually the cause of the horror . He doesn 't kill the kid 's dad which is the most horrible thing in the film ... he 's just killed by an ordinary hick with a grudge and a high powered rifle . The Wendigo only comes out late in the film to avenge the guy who killed the dad ... oh , but wait , it seemed earlier that Wendigo was kind of mad at the dad , maybe because he killed a deer ... so then Wendigo must have been happy that the dad was killed ... but ... And so it goes ... insulting , boring and nonsensical . There is no reason to watch this film at all . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm in two minds about FOLLOWING , the film debut of Christopher Nolan . Part of me admires it for costing 6,000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house . In many ways it reminds me of the cult movie PI , a film I disliked , and I can 't get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . Wouldn 't it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? Oh well I guess FOLLOWING gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $ 6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn 't made by the director of MEMENTO ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy . Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks ' desert-spread in Arizona , where government suits have just invested in the family 's herd of cattle ( which is in dire need of a stud ) . What director Peter Tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills , though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages ( his social commentary isn 't exactly pointed , but Tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes ) . Despite colorful supporting turns by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell , the general wackiness gets way out of hand , and there 's too much hoopin ' and hollerin ' to sustain much interest . As for Elvis , he 's loose and frisky throughout--and while it 's nice to see him having fun on-screen , one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point .

" I just saw this film last night in the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them . The film was simply awful - I say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was awful . Matthew Modine 's days as a leading man are way over . Gina Gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film . Gloria Reuben had a weird little cameo in it - she should also be ashamed . The script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters .

Just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the film.Easy plot ... Boy finds out his high school ex ( boyfriend ) is getting married to a female friend of theirs so he goes back to his old hometown ( still carrying a 10 year old torch ) to see what happened.First off , I liked " " Latter Days " , " the director 's last feature , despite its cookie cutter characters and plot contrivances , but you 're supposed to become a better director with each subsequent release . I don 't know how you get horrible supporting performances out of so many TV veterans ( Robert Foxworth , Joanna Cassidy , Tori Spelling ) , but somehow he managed to . The writing was Lifetime Network quality ( way back when they were REALLY bad ) and the situations were unbelievable AND uncomfortably hard to watch . I kept reaching for a non-existent remote control to fast forward , but ultimately made myself stay to the end , hoping for a decent ending . Ugh ... no . Even the gratuitous male nudity that popped up during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats . To be fair ... the 2 leads , especially in the gratuitous nude scenes , were gorgeous . There was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling friendship as they uncovered how they went separate ways . And the film looked great ... good quality and color saturation for an independent film.How is it that network TV can give week after week of great , entertaining weekly episodes ( Like " " Ugly Betty " , " " " Desp .

" Okay , let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone who 's read the other comments . That being said , MY G-D , THIS MOVIE REEKED ! I mean , WOW , I didn 't know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie ! Corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to the poor quality of the script ! The only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said , ' Hey , Zombies are popular . Video games are popular . What game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it ? Resident Evil ? No , someone else got there first . Silent Hill ? No , too silent . People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly . Hey , didn 't Sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies ? They 're out of the platform biz , we could get that for pennies ! ' Basically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game , even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game.The first and major problem is that the original game was horrid . I mean , bad-movie-merchandising-made-into-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-and-then-shippe d-out-and-bought-by-morons-and-their-parents-for-christmas horrid . The graphics were boring . The monsters were boring . The levels were boring . The interface was boring . The CASE was boring . In other words , this was a boring game . And that was the ARCADE version . The home version was even worse ! With the home version , you didn 't even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game ! But I digress.The second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes . HUH ? ? ? Didn 't the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on ? Not to mention that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective of a video game , which may explain the tedious use of Matrix-style effects . The problem with this is that the game was a first-person shooter ( the player proceeds from the POV of the character ) . Maybe that 's why they put in the game graphics , to let you know that they were alluding to the game ... Right , whatever ... Anyway , the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud , so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and didn 't get me kicked out.To sum up , DON 'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE ! Don 't even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week . Run . Just run . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
The only positive thing I can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now I finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie I ever saw was called.It would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable ... a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even . Why would anyone want to produce such waste ? I refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented . Making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point .

" I have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty , and I can honestly say I feel violated . I had read the reviews and heard the warnings , and I thought I was prepared for anything - at best I thought , a faithful ( if misguided ) attempt at an original adaptation ; at worst , a so-good-it 's-bad " " Plan 9 " " for the new millennium . So when I managed to pick up a copy in Walmart while in Florida and brought it back to the UK , I joked to my friends " " Prepare for the worst movie ever made ! " " Oh , cruel Karma . There is absolutely NOTHING to recommend this film . The " " special " " effects look like the work of a first year design student using a Spectrum ZX81 . The acting is terrible , the accents are WORSE than terrible ( one artillery mans ' accent seems to take us on a tour of the British Isles , from Scotland to Wales via Northern Ireland ) , the dialogue is stilted , the editing is non-existent , the production values prove that no expense has been gone to . Words really cannot describe how bad this movie is ; from the Union Flag flying from the horribly CGI 'd Thunderchild ( the Royal Navy flies the White Ensign , NOT the Union flag ) to the woodworm ridden acting , this is quite simply a crime against film making . When you consider some of the literally-zero-budget fan films that are available on the ' net ( the Star Wars short " " Troops " " for example ) , the whole " " we 're enthusiastic amateurs " " argument goes right out of the window . And if you believe an interview with Hines on the Pendragon website , this film had an 8 figure budget ! I can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the US . Maybe the problem is that Hines & co tried to make a film of the book , rather than turn the book into a film ( if that makes any sense ) . Characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words . Ironically enough , the ONLY person who even came close to giving a decent performance was Darlene Sellers , the ex-soft porn actress . My advice ? Pray like crazy that Jeff Wayne doesn 't screw up , and go watch the Spielberg version . It may not be true to the text of the book , but I can say this ; As a lifelong HG Wells fan ( and Englishman as well ) Speilbergs film IS true to the Spirit of the book .

" Joseph L. Mankiewicz 's Sleuth didn 't need a remake . It 's a thoroughly well made film that stands up well to this day . However , given that the modern day remake machine is currently in full swing ; I really can 't say I 'm surprised to see the film updated for modern audience . The plot remains identical to the original film and at its core we have the story of a young man , Milo Tindle , who goes off to see an older man , Andrew Wyke , to discuss a divorce as the younger man is having an affair with the older man 's wife . From there , a game of cat and mouse ensues . Its clear right from the outset that director Kenneth Branagh wanted to add a different touch to this film and he does so by way of the central location , which has been changed from the charming games-ridden country house of the original to a technical marvel kitted out with layers of security equipment . I 'm glad that the director chose to make this change as nobody wants to see a remake that directly copies of the original ; plus there 's the fact that the location is well used and always nice to look at . Unfortunately , however , the positive elements of Sleuth 2007 end there.The original film was over two hours long , while this remake is only just a shade over eighty minutes . Naturally , therefore , that means that this version has less about it ; and unfortunately it 's the characters that suffer . The plot is also rushed and we get into the first twist in the tale far too quickly and before we are given any chance to actually understand why and how these events can be taking place . The film does not build the characters , or the rapport between them , enough to make sure that their relationship makes sense . One major thing that has been changed about the older character is his obsession ; in the original he was obsessed with games which turned out to be VERY important once the twists come into play . Here he has some kind of security fetish that doesn 't really mean anything by the end . Kenneth Branagh 's handling of the film allows for a classy score but the class ends there . The original thrived on it , but this film is happy merely to soil itself with expletives on numerous , and mostly unwarranted , occasions ; which cheapen the whole thing . The final twist in the tale is completely different to how it was in the original and ensures that the film boils down to a really hideous conclusion . After spending two hours with the original I understood , respected and liked both characters presented in the film - after eighty minutes of this , I hated them both . I do have some respect for Branagh for not merely rolling out a carbon copy of the original film ; but this is not a good adaptation of the great Anthony Shaffer play . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I say ' I 'd figure ' in that line because , frankly , I 've not seen a Hal Hartley movie until now . It 's not that I haven 't heard of him though , as he was seen as one of those small NY filmmakers ( when I say small I mean even smaller than Jim Jarmusch ) , who made ultra-personal projects on limited budgets . In an ironic way , much as with Pasolini 's Salo , though in a slightly different context , Fay Grim interests me to see some of Hartley 's more acclaimed features , because there seems to be at least present some semblance of talent behind it , as if Hartley * could * be a very good filmmaker who may be so good he 's just taken a big experimental blunder . Or , on the other hand , he could just be someone far too impressed with his own idiosyncrasies and would-be Godard-like cinematic collisions.I can 't quite explain the story , which may or may not be a problem I suppose , however it 's not really in due to not having seen the film that preceded Fay Grim , Henry Fool . I think even if I had that experience it wouldn 't make too much of a difference based on the final results . There 's a lot of international espionage , a double plot wrapped inside of another that 's fallen through the fake pockets of the title character , played in an aloof way by Parker Posey ( not sure if that 's good or bad either , maybe both ) , and also involving a CIA operative ( Jeff Goldblum , as usual a solid presence amid the mania , even conjuring some laughs ) , not to mention an orgy-laden picture box , and author Henry Fool . It 's not that the script is totally impenetrable , however much it goes into over-extended loopholes just for the sake of it , because there are some touches of witty or affectingly strange dialog.Quite simply , the direction just sucks . Harltey is in love with the Third Man , which is fine , but he imposes a consistently headache inducing style of everything being tilted in angle , with characters having to get into frame equally oddly . Not since Battlefield Earth , in fact , has a director come off so annoyingly in trying to make the unnecessary choice of titled angles for some bizarre dramatic effect , only this time Hartley isn 't amid a cluster-f * * * , he 's mostly responsible for it . This , along with the crazy wannabe Godard title-cards that pop in here and there , some a little amusing and some just totally stupid , and the montage segments all in still shots , AND a couple of moments involving action that almost call to mind Ed Wood , undermine any of the potential that is in the script , which is already fairly hard to decipher . In a way , it 's fascinating to watch how bad this all goes , but a kind of fascination that comes in seeing the flip-side to total creative control on a sort-of small-scale story.But let it be known : you 'll likely not come across a more wretchedly pretentious example of American independent film-making this year . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A New Generation ' is the third Amityville entry to base its plot around writer John G. Jones 's premise of an item taken from the Long Island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners . First a lamp , then a clock , and now a mirror . However , this is also the first Amityville since ' The Possession ' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series . This time around , Keyes Terry ( Robert Partridge ) , an artist , is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day . Soon enough , people around him start to die , eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the Amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named Franklin Bronner ( Sonny Montelli in ' Amityville II ' ) murdered his entire family . Unfortunately for Terry , his discovery of the mirror isn 't entirely coincidental , and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he 's kept buried since childhood.This 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me . Things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven , yet entertaining ' It 's About Time ' , and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode , but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was . However , three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the Amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me , to say the least . One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series . On the one hand , it 's perfectly reasonable that they don 't want to be tied to someone else 's continuity , but at the very least , they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly * not repeat them over and over again * .There 's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds , doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings . Since you already know what 's going to happen , the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious . Or maybe it 's just tedious anyway . Director John Murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering ' evil ' voices , which lacks any kind of subtlety . There were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities . If they don 't take it too seriously , why should we ? Which is a shame , because ' A New Generation ' has a more-than-capable cast . I was going to hold off on watching this until I saw the name ' Julia Nickson ' in the credits . She captivated my attention just as she always does , and if anything , I was annoyed her part wasn 't more extensive . Terry O 'Quinn was equally charismatic and again , underused . Partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type , and while I 'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed , it 's not as if anyone here is performing Ibsen.The sets are also worthy of note , from the dramatic artwork filling Suki 's room , to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback / supernatural sequences . Getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories . Clearly , Murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor 's director or one of horror . Unfortunately , it is meant to be a horror film , after all . ' A New Generation ' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years . Add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should . However , it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours . Honestly , the ideal person for this is someone who hasn 't seen any of the sequels past ' The Possession ' , for whom the story won 't be such a massive deja-vu trip . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE ( Emilio Miraglia - Italy 1971 ) .I only watched this delirious piece of Euro-tosh in the way of Alpha Video 's dreadful DVD-release ( looks like an extremely bad video-transfer ) , but from what I saw , not nearly interesting enough to purchase No Shame 's recent DVD-release . Considering their excellent track record , it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases . And don 't pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here , it 's not taken from this film ( some girl holding the head of a Jim Carrey look-a-like ) .Spaghetti Western star Anthony Steffen sports a hip hairdo and assumes the role of Lord Alan Cunningham , a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife Evelyn . This leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic . Once released , Cunningham channels this trauma by taking redheaded prostitutes to his countryside castle , subjecting them to vicious acts of torture . His doctor and friend , Richard Timberlane ( what do you mean , Italian horror names sound " " made up ? " " ) , advises him to forget the past and remarry but Cunningham is obsessed with Evelyn and even organizes a s챕ance at the castle . Eventually , after killing some more girls , he meets Gladys , another redhead , and marries her almost immediately , but the arrival of his new wife spawns a series of sinister events . Bloodthirsty creatures strike at Sir Alan 's family , killing them off one by one . Becoming more distraught , Cunningham visits Evelyn 's tomb and discovers it to be empty . Soon , a number of " " outsiders " " begin to suspect something fishy is going on in the castle and Lord Cunningham 's treatment might not have been that successful after all.Director Emilio Miraglia tries to blend Gothic horror with Giallo conventions with limited success . As usual , not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in England . The cars drive on the right side of the road , everyone looks very Mediterranean and the castle ( and the rest of the architecture ) is patently Italian . This is common practice in Italian horror , but sometimes they just take this a little too far . The bad print made this even slightly bearable , since it 's so dark , you couldn 't see much of the surroundings anyway . But , then again , this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality isn 't really the issue . A large part consists of sado-masochistic torture scenes in the castle torture chamber , but most of the time , Anthony Steffen hams his way through this and shows some horrible over-acting . I guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if you 're in the right mood . I just couldn 't take it , at least not with the print I watched . A pleasant score though by Bruno Nicolai which combines easy-listening tunes with some psychedelic rock numbers.Camera Obscura --- 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw the film tonight at a free preview screening , and despite the fact that I didn 't pay a dime to see this film I still felt ripped off . Ladies and gentlemen , time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a Benjamin on your seat . The acting is torpid at best ; Kiefer Sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of Jack Bauer , and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey . Eva Longoria is a non-entity ; she looks like she 's reading her lines off a teleprompter . And if you can 't spot the " " mole " " within the first 20 minutes , then you just landed on this planet from a world without TV and recycled story lines . If you truly want to see a good secret service thriller , rent In the Line of Fire . If you see and buy into this one , you 'll start to fear for the president 's safety because the Secret Service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210 . No matter what your feelings about W , let 's hope this " " art " " does not imitate life . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is just horrible , really horrible trash . Yes , we 've got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex . But while this may work in the mechanism of a porn movie 혯 may have even been a hit as a porn movie 혯 this tries to mask itself as a " " film " " with actual things to say , with real emotion and struggle . It isn 't . It 's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time . I 'm sure all of these women ( and men ) in this particular movie could have faired decently in the porn movie business of the 1970s . . . but not in the actual movie business.The acting was hackneyed , so bad , I mean real terrible . The writing was even worse . I can 't lay all blame on these actors 혯 they had nothing to work with . The very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors . The very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar , as a sniper . These shootings were motivated from men not respecting their women enough . If there was more writing - better writing , much better writing - and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work with.This movie should have been shot , made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all along ; it would have made more money . It practically is a hardcore porn film already , and it remains the only non-porn movie I 've seen that shows a male erect penis . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" God , did I hate this movie ! I saw it at a sneak preview 13 years ago , and I STILL have bad flashbacks . It was , without a doubt , the WORST movie I ever paid to see .

" Stumbled over this film on Amazon.com. Had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of German movies I bought a copy ... Have to say that I was not impressed . The production values are cheap , the story is derivative , the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughs.I wanted to like this but I just found it lackluster and dull . Or maybe I expected more of independent German cinema than a gay spin on The Full Monty and a cast of stereotypes.There are bits in the film that make no sense at all , like one of the Leather Bear 's trying to get Ecki in a sling --like he 'd even look at him twice ? Or the vengeful ex-wife turning up at the match but ending up cheering for her estranged gay husband ? Bunkum is not the word ! Well , at least it explains the movies UK title , I suppose ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If I only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor , enough film for only one take of each shot , and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes , and was forced to make an over-2-hour movie about the French Revolution , and also didn 't have any sets and had to have my 4-year-old autistic son paint the backgrounds , and also the only actors I could find were the people who didn 't make the auditions of that year 's soap opera , and I was also forced to not use any music in the entire film , and also the zoom function on the camera didn 't work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldn 't stop , oh and if I hated my audience , then I might make something kind of like this awful , yet mistakenly hilarious , Hell-worthy waste of time . The almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of George Lucas ' latest creations , which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie , there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel / space laser battle . I don 't mean to spoil the movie for those who haven 't seen it , but that 's not how it ends . The only thing I can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review .

" Heh , if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5.9 , will you call me crazy ? That 's just to catch your attention . Everyday I meet people complaining there are no good movies , who seem to only know the recent blockbusters . It 's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies , especially those with good artistic values . Dick Tracy is one of those can 't be easily outdated , in terms of technology.The negative reviews mainly complained about DT 's " " messed up " " story . But it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear , and I had no problem following it . I didn 't see the comic books , yet I am not a huge US comic fan , but I appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances . Maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell . But , if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together , what would you expect . I had some scratches on my head , and can 't help but wonder , did we really see the same movie ? The title role , although not as competent as it sounds , still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences . Madonna was more express-less than " " breathless " " in her seductive role , but added a lot of fun to the story . Al Pacino was funny and prodigy to himself . Apparently he 's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles . We can see a hybrid of Scarface , Michael Corleone , Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh . And many thanks to make-ups.To me it 's not bad at all . The surreal feeling really got me . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life . This time the target audience is preteen girls , the fact of life is menstruation . This animated film , created by Walt Disney Pictures , apparently with some sponsoring from Kotex.It starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop . With the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body , especially the ovaries , uterus and vagina , work and why this all leads to menstruation . It is almost amazing , becoming the comic note here , how the subject of sex is avoided . Even the word is never mentioned although " " furtilized " " will pass once . I don 't really know why I saw this , but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time , you might want to give it a try . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Someone commented that Charlie Sheen 's character should be court martialed for doing whatever he wanted . You may be right , but that is how SEAL 's truly are . I served for several months with a SEAL team out of Norfolk , VA . Actually , I should say they used our ship to deploy themselves around Europe for a couple of months . I was the postal clerk on board and everyday these guys would try to get their mail . Since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day we issued one pass to one person . Each day a different SEAL would come up pretending to be someone else . Well , after the third time I said no to them until I had proof who they were . They went NUTS ! ! ! I thought they were gonna bust through my cage , gag me , and then steal the mail . Luckily I had not only the President on my side ( The Navy ) , but the Federal Government ( US Mail ) . That was the only time I saw the SEALs stopped from having whatever they wanted . They were allowed unlimited shore leave , where we had to be back on ship at a certain time . They killed and tortured a woman in France and the two SEAL 's only got a 1 week detention on ship , whereas a Seamen was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine shop and he got a court martial . Is it any wonder why the SEAL 's retention rate is over 85 % ? As a SEAL you are god . So this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a SEAL acts and thinks ... unfortunately it is so unbelievable to normal people that it comes off as being fake . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Like most people , i was drawn to buy this film because of the pictures of the mighty Bolo Yeung plastered all over the box , and the assumption ( from the aforementioned pictures and the title of the film ) that this film is all about the Beast from the East kickin ' ass for 90 minutes.However , to my disappointment , Chinese Hercules is to Bolo Yeung what No Retreat No Surrender was to Jean Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger was to ... erm , Bolo Yeung - maximum exposure on video box , minimum actual screen-time ! Oh well ! The storyline is pretty basic stuff , but it was well done - peaceful kung fu fighter ( played by Chen Hui Min ) accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again . He then runs away to work as a labourer on a pier where he impresses his co-workers with his heavy sack lifting prowess , causing them to suspect him to be a formidable fighter ( dont quite know how that works but never mind ) . Meanwhile , the corrupt boss of the pier does a deal with gangsters , giving them exclusive use of the pier . As a result , the workers are thrown out on their ear and forced to live on the beach , where they unite against their boss , the gangster boss , and his hulking henchman Bolo Yeung.While the film was quite watchable ( mainly through waiting for the next glimpse of Bolo ) , i had a few problems with it - firstly , the bad dubbing , but of course thats a given in old kung fu films . But also , the film tended to drag between the various fight-scenes . And as for the fight scenes themselves , i found them to be over-long , badly choreographed ( apparently by Jackie Chan ! ) , badly shot and at times performed by people who didn 't seem to have any martial arts ability .... in fact , most of the fights in this film weren 't ' fights ' at all , just people getting beaten up without offering any resistance ! Finally , the hero - played by Chen Hui Min . I 've never seen any other films with this guy in , but at no point was i rooting for him . Not only did he look wimpy and on the verge of tears at all times , but i found his insistence on not fighting infuriating ! I understood his reasoning , but he could have saved a lot of people a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew he was gonna do eventually , and fight ! A bigger mystery was why this entire community of people were pinning their hopes on a guy they 've never even seen fight ! Really , the big saving grace in this film was the presence of Bolo Yeung . Not only is he as huge and brutal as ever , he has some great , funny lines and gives the rest of the cast a master-class on how to fight on film . The guy oozes screen presence and you can easily see how he became a star . The guy scares the life out of me , but i 'm sure i wasn 't the only person to have watched this film who was rooting for Bolo all through the end fight ! All in all then , a below-average kung-fu film lifted several huge notches due to you-know-who . I 've never met a person who didn 't think Bolo Yeung was great . The man 's a legend ! ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Being a fan of ZaSu Pitts comedies , I thought this one looked like it was worth a try . I was quite disappointed . ( The version I saw was on TCM , but consisted only of the Niagara Falls movie ; the Miss Polly movie was absent . ) The talents of the actors , who give fine performances , is wasted on one of the stupidest stories I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through.Tom Brown ( Tom Wilson ) surprised me by being the strongest actor in the show , but the spotlight is hogged by Slim Summerville ( Sam Sawyer ) , who , if he has any talent , didn 't demonstrate it here.ZaSu Pitts ( Elly Sawyer ) is great , but doesn 't have near big enough a part . The biggest laugh in the movie is when she ends up under Sam under a table.The only one in the movie who has any sense at all is Tom Wilson . Margie ( Marjorie Woodworth ) is unreasonable in general . While she is physically quite attractive , her personality and attitudes make her completely undesirable . Elly , Sam , and the hotel desk clerk are just complete fools.Sam and Elly give up their honeymoon suite in the crowded hotel for Tom and Margie . But then they take it back . Sam ends up imprisoning Tom and Margie in their room . Most of the movie is them trying to break out , but Sam , using a rifle , always puts them back again.Towards the end comes the worst part . Tom , who is finally about to make good his escape , runs into a minister on a lower floor of the hotel . Now the guy , who , as I said , is the only one in the whole movie who has a head on his shoulders , suddenly , for absolutely no reason at all , decides he has to marry Margie ! He drags the minister up to the room he has just escaped from , but Margie doesn 't want to marry him . He gives her a kiss , and now , after one kiss , she feels compelled to marry him.Finally , Sam has the nerve to say to Tom , " " You deceived me , " " when practically the only line Tom had to Sam earlier was , " " We 're not married , " " to which Sam replied , " " You think I 'd believe that ? " " Idiotic . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OK ... before I even start the more or less constructive criticism of the movie I 'd like to say a few words which come from the heart ... THIS MOVIE SUCKS ! ! ! ! DON 'T GO TO SEE IT UNLESS YOU REALLY LIKE SWEATY BOY-BANDS AND WOODEN-ACTING , NO-PLOT STORIES .. So , let 's go to why I think the movie is so bad : 1 . There is not story line . There is no plot . The director tried to create a mystery it the feeling just wasn 't there . 2 . The whole thing looks like a big , hour and a half promotion for some kind of goth-wanna-be-but-still-looking-like- " " BSB " " -band ... All guys in school have perfect abs , no fat or ugly young people ... there is no good looking girl in the movie as well , not one . The main character is either wet in the swimming pool , or all sweaty in his bed ... poor guy . Must be awful to go on a date sweating like that . 3 . Can those guys do something good with their powers ? Anything good ? Like put off the fire in that old barn or help his friend who got into the accident instead of just running around breaking things and showing of in front of each other . 4 . Wooden acting . The main character only has two expressions on his face . Expression number one : sad . Expression number two : trying to look seductive but still seems sad ... In that boy band there are 4 guys : The main characted , his best friend who got into the accident , the blondy , and the fourth one ... what was the name of the fourth one ? I think he only spoke twice throughout the whole film : once in the beginning ( he said the jumping from the cliff using " " the power " " won 't kill them ) and second time at the end when he and the blondy lost the girl ... the movie could have been done without him and no one would notice ... Anyways , my verdict : 1 is the perfect score for this film . Guys - do not go to see it . There is very little action , no suspense , no hot girls . Girls - a least the actors are good looking ... What I would advise you people is to get a soundtreck of this movie - that 's the only thing I liked about it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is just plain bad . Sometimes remakes , even if they stray from the original , are good on their own . They can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable . This was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be . This wasn 't any good even standing on it 's own . Viggo Mortenson is a top-notch actor , but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired . The original " " Vanishing Point " " was such a thrilling , psychological adventure ; this is not an adventure at all , and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever . This was made from a by-the-numbers approach to film-making , stuffing in plot points that someone in Hollywood believes will please what they see as today 's film-going audience . Basically , they see us as a bunch of idiots . It 's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film , and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily . The manipulative plot devices , the " " make-it-obvious-so-they-don 't-miss-the-point " " aspects , ridiculous dialogue , stereotyped characters , amateurish direction ...

" An American in Paris was , in many ways , the ultimate mixture of art and Hollywood musical . Made at the height of MGM 's powers as a musical powerhouse , the film features memorable music from the Gershwins , who rightly have been called the 20th Century 's equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart . Gene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film , though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm-up for his best work in Singin ' in the Rain ( 1952 ) . The two films are actually closely linked . Aside from the Arthur Freed connection , the Broadway Melody segment in " " Rain " " owes its existence to the incredible American in Paris Ballet sequence in this film . This might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film . And it deserved to be , as it showcases Gene Kelly 's skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree.The film 's cast is uniformly excellent . Leslie Caron , incredibly making her film debut , shows a maturity that makes you think she 'd been making films for years . Her introductory dance sequence , and later her work on the Ballet , provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in MGM Musicals only by Cyd Charisse 's work in Singin ' in the Rain and The Band Wagon . Oscar Levant is hilarious as Kelly 's stoic pal , who gets two of the film 's best moments : during the end party sequence ( which I will not give away for anyone who hasn 't seen the film ) , and one of the film 's most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state-of-the-art ( for the time ) special effects.Less memorable are Georges Guetary as Kelly 's romantic rival , though he does get a few musical highlights , and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron 's romantic rival . The May-December relationship between Kelly 's character and Nina 's reminded me of the same " " kept man " " relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany 's.There are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than Singin ' in the Rain . The Ballet , though lavish and well-produced , doesn 't really fit with the rest of the movie . Without giving away the plot , the Ballet just happens , with no real rhyme or reason . And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence , it really doesn 't have anything to do with the plot -- and in the best musicals , the songs always have some sort of raison d 'etre . Making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the Ballet . Although the ending shouldn 't be a surprise ( this IS an MGM musical , after all ) , I was hoping for a bit more ... movie after the Ballet ended . It 's as if director Vincente Minnelli felt that he couldn 't follow the Ballet with anything else . The film literally left me in the lurch.That negative aside , An American in Paris rightly ranks alongside the best of Hollywood 's musicals . It doesn 't quite reach the heights of Singin ' in the Rain , but it comes close and it remains a testament to Gene Kelly 's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This wasn 't all that great . Not terrible or hateful or anything , just forgettable.It had a sort of , um , hesitant , diluted air , like it never properly knew whether it wanted to go for laughs or for sweetness or for satire . So we were left with weak mix of the three . The actors seemed kinda lost.Also , the ideas were really tired and recycled , almost zombified themselves . How many more times do we have to be told the 50 's in the States were infected with a banal sense of conformity ? And that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism ? And that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing ? Old hat.Its biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was . I know it was a comedy and all , but - especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period - you still need some sort of emotional anchor , some relatable guide through the story , to make it engaging . For the ' hero ' kid to watch an old woman , two fellow school pupils and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet it all with a cheery smile and a shrug of the shoulders , then I just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way . The mum was the same . If you make your two main characters so inhuman on that level , then you risk losing me and that 's what happened.Biggest positive I can offer is that I love the look of that sort of apple pie suburbia and this captured it well enough , it was a handsome film , especially some of those wide angled shots of the street and inside the Robinsons ' house . Also , the opening newsreel was cute , in a been-done-before-but-still-funny sort of way.And I thought Billy Connolly was OK and that comes from someone who isn 't a big fan of Billy Connolly : Movie Star . I just had this fear he was going to be hamming it up and trying to steal every scene , but he played it pretty low-key for him and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole film.All in all , not great though . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film was so amateurish I could hardly believe what I was seeing . It is shot on VIDEO ! NOT film ! I have not seen the likes of this since the early 70 's , when late night networks showed movie of the week ' horror flicks ' shot in ...... video . It looks like a bad soap opera , and that is paying it a compliment . Some of the actors give it their best shot . Michael Des Barres does okay with what he is given to do , which is to act like a sex addict out of control . I can 't say that it is pleasant to watch.Nastassja Kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film , with very little variation in camera angles . I can 't fault her for someone else 's poor blocking , but she is totally unbelievable in her role . Her little girl voice works against her here . And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan . She is certainly ageless and exotic , but she 's outside her range with this.Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwrought . Every line she delivers is with three exclamation points . Someone must have directed her to scream at all costs . Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew ? Finally , Rosanna Arquette as the sweet , maligned wife comes off okay , and probably the most believable of the bunch . But that is not saying much.This has to be the worst film I have seen in years . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" and it 's only January , still I 'm sure of it ! By far this is among the worst Swedish movies I 've ever seen and to be honest Swedish movies ain 't that good in general . It have been claimed to be " " original " " and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who never seen a English speaking movie , for us who have been to the cinema the last 10 years it can 't help but to feel like M책ns M책rlind and Bj철rn Stein have been sitting down one weekend going through the most successful movies from the last years and tried to squeeze it all together in to one Swedish package . What can I say the outcome can just be ... poor . First of all the story is just weak to begin with , even worse when it 's not just a poor story it 's a wish to combine to very poor stories - first a failed try to make Swedish action 찼 la Matrix and then combine it with a really bad moral story . And if you thought it could not be worse you 'll notice all the " " cool stuff " " that just have been thrown in there for absolutely no reason at all more than in a bad way trying to show that Sweden also can do Hollywood movies - which we can 't nor should try to . For example the main plot is tried to made deeper by letting youths play a computer game called Storm having absolutely nothing at all with the story or for example how there is a internet side about " " Storm " " while all the sudden it just is the main characters consciousness - really I don 't think even Stein or M책rlind can see a point with three quarters of the movie , more than just trying to show off poor extra effects . For the actors , I 've got to admit Eric Ericson does a pretty good job except he does the same job the whole movie through , even tough Storm tries to be a movie about the personal development of DD he does not change one bit in his way of acting . Jonas Karlsson , well to be honest I thought he was a fairly respected actor but judging by Storm ... really he just have to be ashamed of this movie , his character and his scar . Lastly Eva R철se is just beyond critic , both her character and her acting . The only reasons Storm succeeds of not getting a 1 / 10 is for Eric Ericson and , what can I say , at least it tries .. , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Just a regular Jason lee movie , There were some parts of the movie that were funny . The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess . These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties . It was an all right movie . It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention . I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot . Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie . This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central . I am glad that I didn 't see this movie in the theater , I would have been angry . But I guess that 's why I didn 't see it in the theater . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ok , if you like yer monster moovies sullen , stiff , starchy , and thunderously dull , but with lots of throttling , then head right for " " Lady Frankenstein " , " a stagy , costumy Italian corpse-walker . Joseph Cotten ( " " Citizen Kane " " ) plays the crusty old Baron himself , and must have really needed to make that condo payment . Sexy Sarah Bay , who has played in cow-ntless European B-films , usually as Rosabla Neri , including " " Hercules Against the Moon Men " , " plays his ambitious daughter , a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress . Cotten makes an ugly , big-headed monster ( cud it really be that much effort to make a nice one ? ? ) , who immediately throttles Cotten ( who took his royalty check & ran ) , and wanders around throttling everyone in sight . Tania ( Bay ) decides to switch the brain of her lover ( who is old and wrinkly ) with the brain of a younger man ( who is " " beautiful " , " but stooopid ) , in order to make ANOTHER monster to throttle the first monster Cotten made , who is wandering around throttling people . Well , after much exposition , and some throttling , the 2 monsters throttle each other for a bit , Tania stabs the first monster in the back , and then has sex in the flaming ruins of her mansion with the second monster - only to have him throttle her ! Doh ! There is so much throttling going on that you almoost overlook the fact that the film is about as exciting as a dead carp , and mooves just as quickly . The Alpha Video version I saw for this review was heavily edited , and one wonders cow much nekkid people were chopped out , not that it would have improved the film much . Director von Theurmer previously helmed a variety of grade Z Euro-trash , including " " Jungle Warriors " , " " " Island of the Dead " " ( as Mel Wells ) , and " " The Crucified Girls of San Ramon " . " The MooCow says avoid this corpse of a film , and find something that mooves at moore of a full ... throttle . ; = 8 ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I didn 't expect much from the movie so am not all that disappointed . Carrie looked ugly , Mr. Big had his eyebrows colored with crayons and Samantha didn 't say f * * * . Charlotte 's kid was annoying to watch as she was in too many scenes--the title could easily have been " " SATC : Parents ' Night Out . " " Camera angles just weren 't that good , especially regarding Carrie 's face . There was a token black woman thrown in whose character doesn 't have a proper exit and too few appearances by the gay men friends who seemed thrown in with no purpose anyway . Samantha 's going back and forth from LA choked the story flow , especially when she comes in for Fashion Week and nothing happens . The movie seems to have been made in rush because it could have been good but scenes were just thrown in to show different outfits or to offer viewers a chance to jump back in the show without adding much to the story of the movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Seriously crappy movie.First off , the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse / furniture store . The " " bad " " cop takes a girl , which they had pulled over , into the warehouse 's attic , while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there . The " " bad " " cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag , and the newbie cop doesn 't think there are any problems , but he still wonders what was in the bag , so he asks , gets a bullshit response , and then he thinks everything is OK ( for now ) .The " " bad " " cop repeats this process , and even once with a tit scene ( made it slightly better ) . But eventually people start to catch on , which took awhile considering how f * * * ing obvious it was . One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies , like ya do . Now , the " " bad " " cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch , and then he gets rid of the duffel-bagged body.Since she had the oogey-boogey magic put on her , she comes back with lots of eye-shadow on , which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie ... also , the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become " " eye-shadow monsters " . " Some of the girls meet up with a dude , who is apparently a currency specialist , and he offers them a ride ( they look normal to him apparently ) . But when the girls see other people , such as the one girls husband , he freaks out because she is hideous ( some people freak out , but others don 't even notice ) .... massive plot hole.So , to wrap it up , the eye-shadow monsters kill the " " bad " " cop , who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene . It was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel ! Like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Just saw a pre-screening tonight . What can I say ? It lived up to it 's mediocre trailer run , though that 's saying nothing at all . It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn 't done , and it played out in such a clich챕 fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience , and instead let the humorless movie play out.So let 's see ... we have the less-than-spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex-girlfriend but he 's not good enough for her , check . We have the three buddies that all have their own " " personality " " with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character 's best friend but is constantly rejected , another friend being the super awkward one that can 't live down seeing the positive in everything 24 / 7 and is thrown in for the one-liners ( which in this case is just a bunch of movie references , specifically from Disney ) , and the third guy whose name you won 't ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen ... check . We have the girl 's ex-boyfriend and her parents * * * * -block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up , not to mention the awkward family members from the main character 's side ... check . We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed , check . We have the movie 's " " funny " " moments come from incessant swearing , people falling down or being hit , scenes from the trailer , and homosexual innuendos ... check . And dare I call it a spoiler , but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie ... check.Honestly , this could have ... no , wait ... should have been a PG-13 movie . All that needed to be dropped were any F-bombs . Honestly , it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor , would have gotten less media exposure , and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R-rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up . The humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn 't fit in with what general people look for . I bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera . Let 's put it this way ... in the theater , it will help you laugh because it 's on the big screen and others are laughing . When this movie hits Showtime and you 're checking it out at 2 : 00 PM on an off-day , you may be inclined to change the channel . The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve 's hotness ( who is not quite a 10 , but still very good looking ) .Aside from the main resolution , this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie , where everything else pretty much flies out the window . So there is a main resolution , but what comes of it ? It 's never really clear-cut , nor does it allow the ending to be " " feel-good " " with the abruptness.There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie , and that was the good soundtrack . Aside from the nice choice of 90 's alternative rock songs , there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie ( more so the beginning of it ) that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up / compose . I 'll give them props for a great choice of sound.One last thing , this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer , because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion . I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it . But I say hold onto your money . If this was PG-13 and you were 15 years old on a Friday night with a group of friends , I 'd say knock yourselves out . Otherwise , definitely pass . It doesn 't try and compete with the R-rated movies of the past few years , and ideally it definitely isn 't as good . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was something I had been looking forward to seeing . The Ultimate Avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since Iron Man has been one of my favorite Marvel characters I thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an Iron Man solo title . But the final film was unsatisfying . I wasn 't expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to Iron Man gray armor . The red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together . Not a major complaint but not what I expected from the ads and box . The worse thing however was the story , the acting and the cell-shaded CGI animation for the monsters and Iron Man armor that was not convincing . It didn 't blend in well with the cell animation at all . Even on it 's own it seem stick-like and lifeless . Tony Stark 's character arc , as incredibly slow as it takes , is so forced and unconvincing . I wanted to see this movie because I love Iron Man but after forcing myself through the film I wondered if they couldn 't have come up with something that had been as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I only watched this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and featured Claudio Cassinelli , an actor I like . I was certainly disappointed.The idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for TV ratings has been overdone with Rollerball , Logan 's Run , Blade Runner , and the new film , Death Race , which will certainly suck me in because it stars Jason Statham.This was just a bore for the most part . The " " Kill Bike " " action was ridiculous . The " " training " " was a snooze-fest . It just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone , including " " Dallas " " star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson.Pick one of the others mentioned and you 'll be better off . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What a cast ... and what a waste of it . Seriously , when a movie has Gabriel Byrne , Jamie Foxx , Thandie Newton , Stuart Townsend , Hal Holbrook , Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in it you would expect some quality . The movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can 't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it . Yeah , I think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it.The story is not only messy and unlikely , it also isn 't exactly terribly original . It uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies . But to me it were really the many pointless twist and turns in the movie that did it . It made the story such an unlikely one to watch . On top of that the script remains filled with a lot of holes silly poker game errors and things that just don 't make an awful lot of sense . Why would any one above all things want to play against a card player that is known as the best cheater in the game . This is what the movie is about and builds up to but just didn 't ever made a lot of sense to me.Despite that the movie has a great cast , it still feels as if most actors were miscast in their roles . I don 't know what it is about Stuart Townsend . He is a good actor but in most roles he plays he always feels out of place . Perhaps it are his looks , I don 't known . This basically also was the reason why he got replaced in " " The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring " . " Also Thandie Newton isn 't much good and actually quite annoying in her ' strong ' female role . And what was the point of having Melanie Griffith in this ? Oh , I guess I could go on about the movie its casting and could complaining even some more about the way too limited screen time the Jamie Foxx character gets but I guess you get my point by now.Damian Nieman just isn 't much of an original writer / director and on top of that he also doesn 't handle his own material very well . Scenes often feel disjointed , it tries to put in way too many characters and everything about the movie is shallow and in a way predictable . On top of that the movie features some bad editing at times , which also doesn 't help to make this movie look like one seamless whole . The movie was also one major box office bomb and no wonder that Damian Nieman hasn 't made a movie ever since.A too big mess to make you enjoy this movie.4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The American Humane Association , which is the source of the familiar disclaimer " " No animals were harmed ... " " ( the registered trademark of the AHA ) , began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago , after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film Jesse James ( 1939 ) . Needless to say , the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me . I suppose one could say that at least the horse didn 't die in vain , since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making , but I can 't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice , this sure wouldn 't have been the path he would have taken ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was a real let down for me . The original Bride with White Hair is a great kung fu fantasy film but this one was pretty weak . I didn 't care at all for the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story wasn 't well developed . While the first film was tragic and involving this one was tedious ( as I merely counted the time to the end when the ill-fated lovers would actually meet ) . The action was poor in this one as well . The fights were not choreographed very well and there really wasn 't much kung-fu at all . Just a few weak sword fights between the highly dis-likable Lui and one of Lin 's henchwomen . Lin herself mainly uses a sort of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair , a far cry from the impressive showing with the whip and kung-fu she displayed in the previous film . I still gave this movie a 4 because at least it was fast pace and I did want to see what was going to happen at the end , though I ( as most anyone who watched the first one ) predicted it would go down the way it did and after seeing it I found it anti-climactic and wished they had either made a proper sequel or just left the story alone . I really recommend the first one but as for the sequel only fans of the genre and those who really want to see Lin as the bride one more time need apply . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Three Stooges in a feature length western comedy-musical ? Perhaps " " Rockin ' in the Rockies " " was meant to combine the Stooges comedy short with the western musical , in a matin챕e ; if so , this was a pleasant way to break up a Saturday afternoon . Jay Kirby ( as Rusty ) is a handsome young hero ; and , Mary Beth Hughes ( as the blonde June ) and Gladys Blake ( as the brunette Betty ) are pretty women . The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group ; their songs are quite tuneful ; however , this is the 1940s , not the 1950s , so the film doesn 't exactly " " rock " .

" I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King 's book , the one this movie was based on . After reading this excellent work , I could not wait to see the movie version of it . After viewing the movie , I was TOTALLY disappointed . The only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters . In the book , Schwarzenegger 's character is put on a game show . The main object is to survive . But he 's not in an arena . He 's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show 's ( I guess you 'd call them ) villians , who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters . This premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax . The movie was absolute garbage . There was no cinematic quality to it .

" Usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn 't have a lower rating , and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating . This is not the case here.Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0 / 10 film . It does nothing right and it doesn 't have the chance to because it doesn 't really attempt to do anything . There are strands of a bad D & D novel kind of plot which doesn 't hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout . It is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort , because even a completely patently untalented persons ' hard work would amount to more .

" " " Mad Dog Time " ... " " " Trigger Happy " " whatever you wanna call it ... simply doesn 't hit the mark .

" About the only thing I liked about this film is that there was JUST enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end ... I kept thinking that maybe in the NEXT scene things would gel ... Alas ... Those who like Gus Van Sant 's films - especially his later ones - will probably like this . Personally , I find van Sant 's films to be dull , pretentious and facile . Well , he was an executive producer for this film , so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him - although personally I actually liked this better than van Sant 's latest efforts ( e.g. Elephant ) .Contrary to many here , I did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed , I thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood - the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world - but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all . But I feel that the problem with the film is that " " mood " " is not enough ... and not only that , but that the mood painted here is , to my mind , incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening . The dream-like quality , so closely linked to nature , is beautifully captured here , but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child , one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold ( waves on a beach , grasses and flowers , spiders etc ) . The rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when I was about eight or nine . There is a LANGUOR to the film that is in opposition to what SHOULD be a very tense time in an adolescent life . When you are caught up in a crush on someone - or being the object of bullying at school - you are anything BUT languorous ! There are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film ... SPOILERS HERE - first when Logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit . The frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid - especially with no father present - seemed real to me.The second , and ONLY part of the film with any tension to it , were the scenes where " " Leah " " ( Logan 's re-creation of himself ) phones Rodeo and tries to seduce him into phone-sex . The first reason I liked it is because the person who did the voice-over of " " Leah " " was the most convincing actor in the entire film . ( It made me think of Claire Danes from My So-Called Life ... the voice even sounded like Claire . ) She and Rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids . And what I especially liked was the fact that Rodeo only pretended to play along ... it was perhaps the best moment in the film as - finally ! - we got some character development.All in all , a somewhat misplaced effort ... we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the director 's possible talents . In the meantime , if he can get away from van Sant 's influence , it might do him a world of good . Who is this director anyhow - one of van Sant 's boy toys ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Garden State " " is another of these " " indie " " -type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama . Oddly enough , the production is very good , so are the performances ( by some fairly big-name actors as well ) . Where the picture is lacking is in Zach Braff 's script , which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.When you 're as young as Braff is , you haven 't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder . Braff 's experience looks to be from watching movies , then repeating the same trite clich챕s in his own movie . In Garden State , he plays Andrew Largeman , a semi-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to bury his mother , who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years . He appears to have no feeling about any of this ; he has no relationship with his father , who blames him for causing his mother 's paralysis in a freak accident as a six-year-old , and has no particular despondency over losing his mother ( in fact , he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his , who works as a cemetery grave-digger ) . It all smacks heavily of " " Beautiful Girls " , " also about a guy who returns to his hometown to " " find himself " " and hang with his old friends , with a little " " Ordinary People " " thrown in on the side . It 's really a miracle Braff could accomplish anything at all in his life , given his father and his useless friends ( I 'm surprised he didn 't kill himself ) , who are still living their " " lives " " as though they 're still in high school , partying with dumb bimbos , drinking and drugging , etc . None of them even recognize him from his TV role as the " " retarded quarterback " " ( Natalie Portman 's character , the most aware person in the movie , does ) , and say things , like " " Hey , I remember you from Junior year " . " These guys are such losers , for them , watching television would be a cultural leap forward . Even one friend , who made millions inventing a silent Velcro , has no real reason to live , because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying . And you don 't need big money to party like a high school sophomore.Braff , it is revealed , is heavily medicated , which keeps from " " feeling " " and dealing with anything , really , like an adult would . Then he meets Sam ( Natalie Portman ) a sort-of lost girl , who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10-year-old in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size . Anyway , they fall in love , and Braff learns to " " feel " " again . The clich챕s come fast and furious . Braff has a long delayed heart-to-heart talk with his cold , distancing father and tells him What It Is and The Name Of The Game . In one scene , Braff and Portman are in the millionaire kid 's house , playing touchy-feely is front of a giant fireplace , and the bit is so routine , so standard movie-schtick , I swear , I half-expected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire . In another , Braff visits a doctor ( Ron Liebman ) to get his junk refilled , and Liebman tells him ( in easily the worst line in the movie ) " " The body can play tricks on you . I once found my ex-best-friend 's cufflinks in my wife 's purse , and I didn 't have an erection for a year and a half . " " Obviously , no licensed physician would ever say that , but it 's dirtbag poetry , a nod from Braff to , I guess , his loser friends to let them know he 's still thinking of them , just as the " " 37 " " joke in " " Clerks " , " was Kevin Smith 's nod to his dirtbag buddies . Anyway , Braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope ; the story plays itself out predictably . But if you 're going to have a movie that 's wall-to-wall clich챕s , at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it . And Braff does . He has the right sort of vacancy , of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonked-out Andrew both real and poignant , and Natalie Portman ( also of Beautiful Girls ) gives the movie a big lift . With her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood , she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion . Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman 's mother , and Peter Saarsgard ( though much better in " " Shattered Glass " " ) is notable as the gravedigger friend . I would recommend " " Garden State " " if you can 't get enough storybook romance out of movies , but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece , they 're just clueless . Braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot , write in a few " " f * * ks " " and " " awesomes " " and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material . It doesn 't . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90 % of it that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating at the end . Did the director decide to become auteur suddenly , 80 % through the making of this movie ? Yeesh .

Things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end , when the only likable character is killed off and the anti-hero is blamed ( this would not be so unexpected if this were the main plot of the movie ... but all this stuff starts happening and unravelling during the final reel ! Major curve ball ) . Then things get weird ; the kindly old codger forms a mob and beats the hero to a bloody pulp . The mere presence of the hero 's friend somehow drags a confession out of the real killer - the leering , creepy town nut ( which in any real universe , he 'd have been the prime suspect to begin with , even if the anti-hero was found with her body ) .We 're left with a somewhat feeble " " happy " " ending , which is about as out of character with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes preceding it.Even more odd is this film 's insistence on playing homosexual innuendo to the hilt , but constantly presenting the two male leads as straight . Maybe this was on purpose - perhaps Bix 's resistance to settling down with the girl was more because of his sexuality ( which in the 50s would have to be kept quite repressed , and thus not discussed or even admitted by him ) than his need to be a " " drifter " . " If the director 's intent was to spin this as a sexual yarn - that the drifter drifts because he feels he 's an outcast sexually ; that his paternal regard towards Danny is not , in fact , paternal but spousal ; that his inability to remain with Carrie is rooted in a sexual revulsion that even he does not quite understand - it could have been made more clear . Instead , we get this very bizarre alchemy of homoeroticism and behavior that is completely heterosexual.These young men sleep next to each other even when they can get some room to spread out . When Danny is propositioned ( and once even in bed with a woman ) , Bix flips out and takes him away . Danny pays Bix 's way ( sure , there is another explanation for it , but it still strikes a chord every time you see Danny buy Bix 's lunch ) . They end up living together at the end . Not since Hitchcock 's " " Rope " " has homosexuality been so blatant but denied.MST3K did the right thing by taking this one on . Aside from Jack Elam , there is little to commend the film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well this is a typical " " straight to the toilet " " slasher film.Long story short , a bunch of teenagers / young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons.This movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage : -Naked women , -teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky , -gory death scenes , -the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff , but never bra less , -a creepy , crazy man who knows about the evil , -lesbian kiss scene , -sex being a killer , -no plotEven then for a cheesy slasher film , it was really terrible . The atmosphere is totally dead . Nothing , not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity , was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested .

" Frankly , after Cotton club and Unfaithful , it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film , because it is BAD . The acting was bad , the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere . It was well shot , but , then again , it is a big budget movie . It was too predictable , even for a chick flick . I even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end , the only thing I didn 't know was how . Too politically correct . Very disappointing . The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house , because it is beautiful . But , if you want that , watch National geographic . I love Lane , but I 've never seen her in a movie this lousy . As far as Gere goes , he 's a good actor , but he had movies like this , so I 'm not surprised .

" This is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible . Obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny . What is it with the talking car with buttons that say Wendy 's , McDonalds , M & M 's and Skittles ? There was no talking car in the cartoon . ( Dr. ) Claw is supposed to be evil , not handsome and charming . Why is Rupert Everet ' Claw ' anyway ? Were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes ? It looks like they were ( badly ) lampooning Robo Cop , with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing . I tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie , you don 't get a refund . I 'm sorry I watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap .

" I should have trusted my instincts better : No expectations - no disappointments . Instead , however , I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi ( 1983 ) and was brutally disappointed . Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor , and - artistically - it fails miserably . It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi , hurriedly threw it together , placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music , which is incessantly repeated . Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes , Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow-motion ( if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode , you 'll see what I mean ) . What disappointed me the most , however , was Philip Glass 's soundtrack . I couldn 't - and still can 't - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age type drones , which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a Casio calculator , were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi . All in all , a big waste of time ! My advice : Forget commercialism ! Watch Koyaanisqatsi again instead ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad . The premise was O.K , but the plot itself was terrible .

Jason Schwartzman was once again immensely irritating - even more so than in Rushmore , the rest of the cast were quite non-eventful .

" Not a terrible film -- my 10 year old boy loved it , and he would be the target demographic , so I guess they hit the spot . Pretty dull for an adult though.Hard to relate to animated lego characters , even mod high-tech ones.I thought the choice of the three great virtues of the Bionicle world was a bit odd -- unity , duty , and destiny . Am I the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic ? Especially destiny . What about freedom , equality , justice , etc . ? Oh well , it will sell Lego .

" LOL ! Not a bad way to start it . I thought this was original , but then I discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of KING KONG . I never saw KING KONG until I was 15 . I saw this film when I was 9 . The film 's funky disco music will get stuck in your head ! Not to mention the film 's theme song by the Yetians . This is the worst creature effects I 've ever seen . At the same time this film remains a holy grail of B-movies . Memorable quotes : " " Take a tranquilizer and go to bed . " " " " Put the Yeti in your tank and you have Yeti power . " " I remember seeing this film on MOVIE MACRABE hosted by Elvira . There is one scene where it was like KING KONG in reverse ! In KING KONG he grabs the girl and climbs up the building , but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl ( who was falling ) ! Also around that year was another KONG clone MIGHTY PEKING MAN ( 1977 ) which came from Hong Kong . There is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts . This film will leave you laughing . It is like I said , just another KING KONG clone . Rated PG for violence , language , thematic elements , and some scary scenes . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is definitely a " " lesser known " " comedy short from the 1920s . The only reason I saw it was because it was on a DVD by Kino Films featuring non-Laurel and Hardy shorts featuring Ollie . They are interesting and historically important , but also generally average to below average for the style film . Compared to shorts by Chaplin , Keaton , Arbuckle and Lloyd , they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor . Also , the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent DVDs . I ended up turning OFF the sound due to the inappropriateness of the music to set the proper mood . But , despite this , they are still worth seeing.I 've gotta be honest about this short . It was the last of 8 on this DVD and by the time I got to it , I was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts . So , it is possible the film might be A LITTLE better than a 4--but certainly , if this is the case , no better than a 5 ! The film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy . Nothing especially interesting and there are certainly MUCH better silent shorts out there . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The two things are are good about this film are it 's two unknown celebrities.First , Daphne Zuniga , in her first appearance in a film , young and supple , with looks that still encompass her body today , steals the very beginning , which is all she is in , and that is that . She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects.Second , the score by then known composer Christopher ( Chris ) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star ... yeah , I know one star more is not much , but in this movie 's case , it is a lot.The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down , getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer , blah , blah , blah ... we all know where this is going.Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga , then turn it off . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It was not bad enough to turn off , but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotyping . It was not very well cast either.Would I recommend this movie ?

" Yet again , I appear to be the only person on planet Earth who is capable of criticizing Japanese films made before 1970 . " " Fires on the Plain " " ( 1959 ) is another in the seemingly endless line of " " classics " " that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason . As much as I love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film , it 's still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of " " masterpiece . " " What I find truly ironic is that fans of derivative " " classics " " like " " Fires on the Plain " " focus so much on " " inside the box " " movie-making ( orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting , acting , camera-work , etc . ) yet it always seems like the most highly revered " " classics " " are most deficient in these very standards . For example , one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial . Most surprisingly , the very first scene in " " Fires on the Plain " " uses this indolent tactic to the extreme.After a funny head slap , the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer , " " Why can 't you grasp the situation ? We landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at Tacloban . We lost two-thirds of our men . Our artillery was sunk in transit . We tried to reach Burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible . The enemy 's counterattack forced a fanout across the valley . You know that . " " So why , exactly , is one character telling another character something he already knows ? Oh yeah , that 's right , the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information . You see , a quality film would actually show these events happening , or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events . Heck , even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired here.Such instances of poor quality movie-making are littered throughout " " Fires on the Plain " " to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles . For example , the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in Japanese garb . Instead of doing the natural thing like 혯 oh I don 't know 혯 giving a depressed mannerism , the character blurts out " " Japanese soldiers . " " Thanks buddy , but I could have figured that one out for myself.Even worse , this movie is saturated with over-dramatic ploys . The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots . Picture this . A soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots . One would think that such a find is utterly useless , but it turns out that the soldier 's boots are in even worse condition , so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his SUPER worn boots behind . Fine , I get the point . The soldiers are in rough shape 혯 a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with . The scene is ridiculous , but I was ready to let it go , until the SECOND soldier arrives ! You see , he finds the previous soldier 's SUPER worn boots and notices 혯 get ready , cause here it comes 혯 that his boots are SUPER DUPER worn boots ! Lucky man , he picks up the SUPER worn boots and leaves his SUPER DUPER worn boots behind . But you see , that 's not all 혯 because the THIRD soldier then arrives ! He finds the previous soldiers SUPER DUPER worn boots and inspects them , along with his own SUPER DUPER worn boots . Since both pairs suck , he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot . At this point I was ready to throw my television through my living room window . The heavy handedness , overdramaticism , and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film-making . It 's SUPER DUPER bad film-making.There are a number of similar , completely stupid moments to be had . Like the time when the lead character asks someone , " " Hey , are you dead ? " " Like the guy is going to answer " " Yes " " if he actually kicked the bucket . I 'll also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor , who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction . I laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid , goofy expression on his face.The fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an IMDb average rating of 8.4 while a certifiable masterpiece like " " A Tale of Two Sisters " " ( 2003 ) only gets a 7.5 is the height of mass stupidity . And to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that " " AToTS " " doesn 't make sense . Well , not every movie can have completely outrageous SUPER DUPER worn boots on its side . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The movie is basically a boring string of appalling clich챕s which do not offer a real cross-cultural insight .

I wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture . The personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible . The original idea might have been interesting , but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight , you should skip this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I had the misfortune to watch this last night on the BBC , I expect I may have been the only viewer . From the beginning there was something quite wrong about the movie , after a few minutes of viewing i managed to work out what it was . THE MOVIE WAS BAD ! Not bad in a good way like Wolfpack or a Seagal film just plain old shoddy bad.Why was this made into a movie ? I 've seen a few episodes of the TV series and thought it was alright but I only saw repeats of that because they made this.I spent most of the film trying to work out what the story was and by the end I was none the wiser . I seem to remember at some point a character , maybe Farina 's mentions that the Mod Squad can get in to places regular cops can 't . The ' place ' turns out to be a ' club ' , one of the toughest places to get into , maybe it was student night ? I lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was no plot and the movie was just chopped together from various leftovers from other TV series remakes.Was it an action comedy ? I don 't remember any laughs.Overall this movie lacked the real scene stealing power of someone like Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy . With him Ribisi would have had somebody to bounce off . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Let me begin by saying that I adore the book and loved the A & E miniseries . I was hoping to love this film , and I was absolutely willing to allow it a moderate degree of artistic license in interpreting and abbreviating the actual story . However , this film scarcely resembles the original book . If only " " the names had been changed to protect the innocent , " " I would have possibly enjoyed the movie as simply an entertaining , if inaccurate , period piece.Unfortunately , putting the name " " Mr. Darcy " " on a character who is emotional and weak , giving the name " " Elizabeth Bennett " " to a reckless , snippy , often teary-eyed hoyden who cares nothing for the rules of society , and making " " Mr. Bingley " " a wide-eyed dimwit absolutely destroyed the idea that the director had ever read Jane Austen 's original story . There are some really stellar moments in this movie -- perhaps a total of 10 minutes are truly excellent . Charlotte 's explanation of why she accepted Mr. Collins ' proposal begins beautifully . She is 27 years old ( quite near the hopeless-spinster age in those times ) , she is becoming a burden on her family , and she is not romantic . She only wants " " a comfortable home . " " However , the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she blubbers , " " Don 't you judge me , Elizabeth . Don 't you dare judge me ! " " and runs off in tears . Later , you see Charlotte kowtow to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , which was not at all in her character as described in the book . Another good moment is when Darcy catches Elizabeth in his home while she is touring the area with her aunt and uncle . It was well done in the A & E series , but the film version with Keira Knightley made the audience feel acutely how very humiliating that moment must have been for Elizabeth . Very nice.The ending also illustrated a level of affection between Elizabeth and Darcy that was not shown as obviously in the miniseries . I actually appreciated that scene , simply because I like to see a happy ending , rather than just know that it took place . Altogether , though , this movie eliminated the subtlety that was such an integral part of Austen 's Pride and Prejudice . The characters speak in a jarring combination of Austen 's dialogue verbatim and modern phrases and colloquialisms . Information that was only alluded to or suggested in the original work is blatantly stated in this version . Yes , time was a concern . It 's only a short movie , yada yada . But turning a complex , beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous . Some have commented that they loved the moment when Darcy first sees Elizabeth , because it is so obviously a case of " " love at first sight . " " Love at first sight ? Huh ? One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty , and Darcy comes to love her for her wit and liveliness ... he literally " " loves her for her mind . " " This version also had a moment ( during Darcy 's first proposal ) when the two are yelling furiously at each other , while leaning closer ... and closer ... and almost kissing ... but they suddenly step apart . Ugh ! What a sad clich챕 . They 're angry and disgusted with each other , but so attracted that it doesn 't matter that ( at the time ) they don 't even like each other ? Ridiculous ! The characterizations were all so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like a different story . Mr. Bennet was dour , Elizabeth usually acted just as silly as her younger sisters , Charlotte was emotional , somewhat unintelligent and desperate for a home of her own -- unlike the intelligent , slightly scheming woman with an abundance of common sense who is portrayed in the novel . Jane and Elizabeth 's relationship is merely topical , instead of the deep-rooted love and admiration they are supposed to have for each other . All this I could have accepted as merely poor interpretations of the novel , but I refused to accept all that in addition to the many , many historical inaccuracies . Miss Bingley walked around scarcely clothed ( her dress looked like what the others would wear as tight undergarments ) . Elizabeth walked to Netherfield with her hair down and allowed to fly all over . The family lazed about one morning , though mornings were supposed to be reserved for calling on acquaintances ( or being called on at your own home ) . Elizabeth walked outside barefoot in her nightgown . And in a really appalling scene , Bingley walked into Jane 's bedroom and conversed with her ( and sounded like an idiot ) when she was ill . Most people would feel these are minor points , but I simply wanted either A. ) an historically accurate film , or B. ) an accurate representation of the characters in the novel . The director / writer / whoever sacrificed accuracy , subtlety and a good story for a trite tale of love at first sight . I can concede that those who have not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of the time could very easily like this movie , and there is nothing wrong with that . I simply couldn 't overcome my desire to see a film that involved more than just two pretty faces . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a formula B science fiction movie , and the director made no bones about it . It is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team . Everything done is stuff you 've seen many times before . It is a weak script , with no real characters . In fact , it is full of stereotype characters and situations . The director attacks this by just making it a formula movie , with no attempt to fool us , and that gives this movie a mild appeal , but it isn 't something you 're likely to remember a while . It is best seen while you 're cooking , cleaning , working out . Sort of mindless fun . It has its place in entertainment , but it certainly isn 't something you sit down with friends to watch , unless you 're all just drunk and don 't care . The mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair . I don 't think it is as crappy as most people , but I am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular . That really eludes me , as I see no attempt to even make this a memorable film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" When a man who doesn 't have Alzheimer 's can 't remember how many films he 's made , he probably is the world 's most prolific director after all . That man is Jesus Franco , the king of so-called ' eurotrash ' . His 1980 flick Devil Hunter is as rushed , opaque , stupid , lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word ( the film 's title is misleading , for starters ) as any other Franco film I 've seen . That makes it sound pretty awful , and it is ... Yet Franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility , a generous way with the baldly outrageous , with nudity and sleaze and violence , and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made . The mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out , even while you 're mostly waiting for them to end because they 're so very tedious.Devil Hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour . The kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in South America . There 's lots of naked writhing , dancing , and endless repeated zoom-ins on an ugly totem pole . You need to get used to the repetitive zoom-ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away , as these are Franco 's main methods of extending a film out to feature length.The monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary . He has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning , apparently recorded in an echo chamber . Early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree , and it 's hard to know what really happens here but I think he ate her stomach ( or her genitals , sweet Jesus ! ) .Anyway , the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out Vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers . The flakey guy has an accent which , as dubbed , is half Brooklyn-American , half English-Liverpudlian and all retarded . All of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable , making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest.Not too much really happens from here on in , and it happens pretty sluggishly , studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape . The nebulous action is fleshed out ( haha ! ) by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads , and even from the monster himself . That he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero , but it 's gotta be done at some point , and it 's nice to note that the director will show anyone 's genitals on camera.The best feature of Devil Hunter is the location filming . Franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film-making , but he doesn 't muck around with sets . You get real islands , jungles , helicopters and mountains , all in widescreen . This is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy CGI sets and backdrops ad nauseam.Ultimately , issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot . If you 're trying to see all the Video Nasties , you will have to watch this at some point , and you 'll be made as restless as I was . If you like Franco , you 'll watch this anyway . If you fall into neither of the above categories , the odds are you 'll never come across this film . Copies of it aren 't just lying around , and I could hardly recommend the seeking out of it . It 's Franco . Lazy , crazy Franco . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen.Rather , the mystery is why this perennial ratings disappointment is still on the air . This week marked a nadir for Veronica Mars : it ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 ( soon to be Big 5 ) . Yes , you read right . Veronica Mars was beaten by every show of the now-defunct WB and every show on UPN . It was beat by all the shows on Fox and of course by all the shows on ABC , CBS and NBC.Now , the hip hypesters are going to say : but this was a re-run . But everything on TV that week was pretty much a re-run ! It boggles the mind why CW would choose this proved ratings disappointment as one of the few shows it saved from UPN.Clearly something is going on behind the scenes . Favors are being exchanged and influence peddled.Sorry to be so cynical , but what other explanation is there ? The " " Veronica Mars has potential " " line is clearly dead now that it 's had two years to establish itself and failed to do so.Maybe it 's Joel Silver 's influence and clout , but frankly , I am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend their clout on a bad show that no audience is watching.A great mystery and a very inauspicious debut for CW . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Shakalaka Boom Boom is a rip off from the movie Amadeus . I personally rate Amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it is about music , which is my favorite subject , but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music he produced during his life-time , but for his own self-destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35 , being virtually uncelebrated during his life time because of the politics played by some people , particularly Saliere , the Italian composer , who was jealous of him.Personally , I was shocked to see Shakalaka .. , as the director has invariably cut-pasted most of the scenes from the movie Amadeus . I see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and am skeptic about the kind of movies Bollywood keeps on churning day by day . The movie is a disaster , the two musicians in the movie don 't give you any feeling of being realistic , the film is tasteless , meaningless and total failure on every count . The only person who makes an impact is Bobby Deol , who at least knows how to act . Otherwise , the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs.The irony is that while watching the movie , the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance with anyone is purely coincidental which is a blatant lie , because all resemblances are very much clear and they are very much intended . I wish I could take Darshan and Co. to court not only for Copyright Infringement , but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " The Screaming Skull " " opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there 's a hook ! The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick : scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness , then attempts to convince her that she 's going insane with shrill noises , mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times . Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man 's first wife who he was devoted to . Maybe it 's just that the 1950 's didn 't have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie , the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane . But then again , when I first saw " " House on Haunted Hill " " as a nine year old , it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way I 'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.Don 't get me wrong , the film is not terrible , it just seems to get tedious at times . But there 's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home , and the gardens and pool are a nice touch . For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock ( John Hudson ) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull , he just wades right in clothes and all , in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener ( director Alex Nicol in a dual role ) . It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.In it 's own good way , perhaps the most shocking thing about the film : how about that neat roadster the Whitlock 's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958 ! That at least made me jump out of my seat ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Well it certainly stunned me - I can not believe that someone made another Australian film that 's even more boring than Somersault . The story is implausible , the characters , with the exception of Friels ' and Mailman 's characters , are unlikeable and wooden , Tom Long possesses a VAST array of facial expressions : happy and not happy , and the " " sex scenes " , " which could have been very confronting and disturbingly erotic , would have been at home in a low-budget porno flick.This is the first movie I have seen in 30 years of cinema-going that has had me on the edge of my seat .... ready to get up and leave.The best thing about this movie is the promotional poster . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining . So can Whoopi Goldberg movies . But Whoopi AND dinosaurs ? After the first 20 minutes of " " Theodore Rex " , " I had come to one conclusion : this movie is evil . Evil , vile , wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience . Nothing this bad is made by accident ; this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber.First of all , Whoopi does not make good action movies ( watch " " Fatal Beauty " " if you think I 'm lying ) , but the film makers don 't care - she 's a tough cop here , yet again . Seen a million cop buddy flicks this week ? Well , here 's number one million and one , pal.Don 't like cute , humanistic animated dinosaurs since that Spielberg TV show about them ? Too bad , here 's another one and he 's a cop , too ! You one of those people that hates car chases , shoot-outs , sloppy dialogue , boring futuristic FX and seeing talented people ( Goldberg , Mueller-Stahl , Roundtree ) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write-off ? A BIG tax write-off ? And you read this review all the way to the end . You DESERVE a sequel . Seriously.No stars , not a one . And if they really make a sequel to " " Theodore Rex " , " Hollywood deserves to be attacked a whole herd of wise-cracking foam rubber dinosaurs.Now , I 'd pay to see that . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If regarded as an independent feature I can 't say it 's too bad at all but from where I 'm standing this sequel and the original " " Lady and the Tramp " " don 't agree with each other ! They are two completely different movies with different style , different voice personalities , different narratives and about the only thing that they share with each other is the visuals ( e.g. the town-house of Jim Dear , Darling , Lady and Tramp ) and none of those have changed.If you 're seeking any kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like " " Bella Notte " " and " " The Siamesse Cats Song " " this sequel won 't give you any at all ! Just about every song has a little pop to it and those good old characters like Jock and Trusty , Jim Dear and Darling and Aunt Sarah and her cats may well be seen but they 're seeming to be somehow replaced by new characters , not to mention Peg not appearing at all , whose voices are quite annoying . Even Lady and Tramp don 't appear often enough and as for Scamp ? ! He is so spoilt ! And treats his father Tramp with utter disrespect , then runs away with no remorse even after hearing how much he 's being missed at home ! And they called his shameless getaway an adventure ! I 'd say Scott Wolf truly brought out the abusive bad boy in Scamp wiping out the typical cute Disney animal . Even the old characters just drive you mad in this ; Trusty sounds like Goofy sick in bed , Jock ( Jeff-stupid-Bennett ) - and his VOICE - sound neither Scottish nor worth hearing ! Zap him off as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the dumb , feather-brained , EXASPERATING JUNKYARD DOGS ! ! ! ! ! ! Somebody put them down ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " " Lady and the Tramp 2 " " isn 't completely bad if you 're not already having a tough day but I expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic - Scamp is chavvy , so is his girlfriend Angel and there is a feeble storyline . Still , I think you should try it at least once because , as I say , there are much worse movies around . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Trite and unoriginal . It 's like someone watched Immortal Beloved and Amadeus and decided to mix them together and , in the process , steal other formulaic plot parts from other movies to make another one . As with most historical movies nowadays , there are some inaccuracies as history is manipulated to better suit the story , which is understandable for the most part . For example , during the remaining days of Beethoven 's life , it was necessary for other people to write down what they needed to say in order for him to understand them . That , of course , would have been a nuisance to have to show on screen . The script , although filled with some quotable lines , doesn 't quite capture the feel of that time period and , coupled with some bad acting , seems rather contemporary . Diane Kruger is nice enough to look at but she still has lots to improve on her craft . Ed Harris doesn 't work for me as Beethoven and I mostly blame Gary Oldman for that . Overall , not a very good interpretation of the musical maestro 's life . Better just find yourself a copy of Immortal Beloved.http : / / iwascalledclementine.multiply.com / reviews , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old Indian traditions . At times it is clear how most of the ' doctors ' are charlatans , even lying about how they don 't charge their clients . While they are wearing their gold watches , the ' donation ' box is mandatory . Notice that there are only a couple of people who get ' cured ' while we see quite a few cases.Keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest Indian bank note is 5 rupee , while the average salary in India is 1,700 ru / month . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Don 't get me wrong , I love action and revenge flicks , I 've seen many of them since I was a kid , including Dolph Lundgren 's latest " " The Mechanik " " which is quite good . And Tony Scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.But with " " Man on Fire " " ( and even more then with " " Domino " " ) , Scott shows that rather than using his film-making " " genius " " skills intelligently , he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesn 't offer him . " " Man of Fire " " is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less.The way Scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you ( the audience ) to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it.At times where the MPAA and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings , violence and making PG-13 movies , I find also suspicious that a $ 70 million movie is made of a B-movie script with a character who cuts fingers , puts a bomb in a man 's ass and blows a guy 's hand with a shotgun , all this to avenge the death of a little girl who ISN 'T even dead ! Go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence ... Thus said ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" As is often the case , films about self-loathing characters do not usually make for good drama . ' Downloading Nancy ' is no exception . It 's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who 's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet.The protagonist is Nancy ( Maria Bello ) who is married to Albert ( Rufus Sewell ) . Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar / restaurants . Unlike most human beings , Albert has virtually no positive attributes ( except for his ability to be successful in the business world ) . Throughout the film , Albert has a grim and dour expression on his face . He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes . When his wife asks for sex , he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead.Nancy is equally one-note as a character . Not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up ( thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film ) . Her self-loathing takes the form of self-mutilation and a result , she 's forced into therapy . However , she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made.Finally , Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis over the internet . He 's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo , who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot . It 's revealed that Louis has two children but no longer sees them ( the children 's mother no longer wants anything to do with him ) .Nancy 's plan is to first have painful sex with Louis and then have him kill her . There 's a particularly unpleasant scene where Louis has sex with Nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass . These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis pays a visit to Albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club . It seems that Louis has a two-fold plan in going to see Albert : 1 ) berate him for his treatment of Nancy and 2 ) enjoy the beating he receives . It takes awhile before Louis will reveal Nancy 's fate혰first , he forces Albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future . Nancy 's fate of course is that Louis finally ended up choking her to death ( but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some ' feelings ' for her ) . We soon learn that Louis is imprisoned for life for Nancy 's murder.What exactly are we to take away from a film such as Downloading Nancy ? Are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence ? Is that the main point of the film ? Is sympathy for Nancy actually warranted ? I don 't think so . The film 's writers create a straw man in the character of Albert혰someone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for Nancy 's decline . But are people so one-dimensional in real life ? I think not . They have the repulsive Louis , a man who makes a living by inflicting pain , come over and berate Albert for neglecting Nancy . Furthermore , his expressions of love towards Nancy ( before he kills her ) , is supposed to show his ' sensitive side ' .In the end , it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film . They are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence , that Downloading Nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This film reminded me of The Sopranos , and not in a good way . David Chase 's seminal mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice , the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season , when Junior Soprano went on trial for his life . Rather than pursue this riveting ( and pivotal ) plot line , the writers instead chose to completely ignore it , focusing instead on Bobby Baccalieri 's constant whimpering over his recently deceased wife 's frozen pasta dish . When something of genuine interest happens in Notorious - for example that first , mysterious assassination attempt on Tupac Shakur that ignited the whole East Coast / West Coast feud in the first place , and ended up leading to the deaths of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - the film treats it as just another bit of plot to plod through . Why exactly was Tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people ? Did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight ? And was Lil ' Kim 's transformation from prim office drone into sex-obsessed , vampish diva really as banal as it appears here ? None of these questions are even fleetingly addressed by the film 's screenwriters , who are far more interested in depicting Wallace 's turbulent love life to zero compelling dramatic avail . These sequences ( including a brain-frazzlingly clich챕d groupie indescretion in a hotel room ) are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network TV movie.The storytelling , in both structure and content , is simplistic and trite . But more fundamentally , as a biopic ; as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work ; the film is almost entirely worthless . The reliance on meat-and-potatoes genre plotting , coupled with the lifeless musical performances ( an area in which a film like this should soar , surely ) result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved , leaving Wallace 's questionable status as a giant in his field as the preserve of the easily persuaded and previously converted only . And the final twenty minutes , in which Wallace 's posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint , quite frankly made me feel like throwing up . On that score , much as with any other , Notorious is crass , calculating and compromised . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Devil 's Experiment : 1 / 10 : Hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot ( Gee that is one lucky pizza boy ) and those without ( Anal Amateurs 36 ) .

Shot on video in 1985 it consists of three relatively non-descript Japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive Japanese girl . The tortures range from the banal ( slapping her 50 times , kicking her a hundred ) , the silly ( tying her to an office chair and spinning her around ) , the fear factor ( a bath of maggots and sheep guts ) and finally the money shot .

" The final entry in the On The Buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in Wales . I feel sure the franchise could have continued , but Harold Pinter complained that the screenplays made him look bad in comparison , and so no more were made . It 's actually less than two minutes before we get our first dollop of sexism - a woman running for the bus finds her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason whatsoever . Still , it does at least make Stan ( Reg Varney ) laugh - but then what doesn 't ? He and Jack ( Bob Grant ) spend the entire movie laughing uproariously with little or no provocation . You get the impression that they 'd wet themselves watching paint dry . As before , the only funny element is the genuinely amusing Stephen Lewis , hilarious as Blakey . He 's on his own , though , with a cheesy , dated script that even wastes first-rate talent like Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee . Yet it seems as if only Lewis understands how to time the shaky material , wringing laughs out of even the weakest lines . Describing how her daughter fell in a river , Stan 's mum laments " " I hope it 's not polluted . " " " " Well it will be now " " Blakey quips . The plot - if indeed there is one - sees Stan lusting after a young girl , but being continually thwarted by her domineering mother . It 's a recipe for side splitting hilarity I 'm sure you 'll agree , and whether it 's on a storm-lashed boat or the swimming baths , Stan and Mavis 's exploits always produce the same result ... abject boredom . Later conquests include Maria , an Italian stereotype , and a staff co-worker . Even Stan 's mum gets a one-night stand , with Stan considerately reminding her to " " put your tin drawers on . " " When one of the comic " " highpoints " " is Arthur Mullard overhearing Olive trying to locate a light switch in the dark ( " " I can 't find it " " ) and thinking she 's talking about sex , then you can see why this work reaches the upper levels of literary sophistication . In fact , why it didn 't get in the BFI 's Top 100 movies is beyond me . Other rib-tickling shenanigans involve Olive ( Anna Karen ) breaking her glasses . I don 't know what 's more surprising , the lame predictability of the set-up , or the underdeveloped pay-off . The short sighted Olive follows a man in a kilt into the gents , thinking he 's a woman in a skirt . The next shot sees her marched out by Blakey and redirected to the ladies . And that 's it . Next , she ends up in another man 's bed , and is ordered out by his wife .

Films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b / w prints , because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway .

Don 't know where Leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate .

My opinion about Will of Their Own would be much better if there wouldn 't be one point that I just don 't get.There is lovely and really touchy scene in which Lea Thompson 's character is running on the street holding baby in her arms , the snow is falling , she is cold , scared , and has no place to stay , she doesn 't know what to do next . And then about 10-12 years later , when things are better for her , she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming about.I just don 't get it - I don 't see how is it possible that she would do such thing , it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival .

" Thunderbirds ( 2004 ) Director : Jonathan Frakes Starring : Bill Paxton , Ben Kingsley , Brady Corbet 5혚4혚3혚2혚1 ! Thunderbirds are GO ! And so began Thunderbirds , a childhood favorite of mine . When I heard that they were going to make a Thunderbirds movie , I was ecstatic . I couldn 't wait to see Thunderbird 2 roar in to save people , while Thunderbird 4 would dive deep into the혚you get the idea . I just couldn 't wait . Then came August 2004 , when the movie was finally released . Critics panned it , but I still wanted to go . After all , as long as the heart was in the same place , that was all that mattered to me . So I sat down in the theater , the only teenager in a crowd of 50혚everyone else was over thirty and under ten . Quite possibly the most awkward theater experience that I have ever had혚 The movie ( which is intended to be a prequel ) focuses on Alan Tracy ( Brady Corbet ) , the youngest of the Tracy family . He spends his days wishing that he could be rescuing people like the rest of his family , but he 's too young . One day , he finally gets his chance when The Hood ( Ben Kingsley ) traps the rest of his family up on Thunderbird 5 ( the space station ) . This involves him having to outsmart The Hood 's henchmen and rescue his family in time before The Hood can steal all of the money from the Bank of England.Trust me , the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper . Once it gets put on to film혚what a mess we have on our hands . First off , the film was intended for children , much like the original show was . However , Gerry Anderson treated us like adults , and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for children 's programming . This on the other hand , dumbs down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the Spy Kids franchise . The final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the Thunderbirds series and children , while missing both entirely . Lame jokes , cartoonish sounds , and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie , and I 'm sure that Jonathan Frakes is wishing he 'd never directed this.Over all , everyone gave a solid performance , considering the script that they were all given . Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood , playing the part extremely well . My only complaint about the characters is about The Hood 's henchmen , who are reduced to leftovers from old Looney Tunes cartoons , bumbling about as , amazingly enough , the kids take them on with ease.What 's odd about this movie is that while I was watching the movie , I had fun . But once the lights went up , I realized that the movie was fairly bad , I was $ 8 lighter , and two hours of my time were now gone . A guilty pleasure ? Perhaps . Nonetheless , Thunderbirds is a forgettable mess . Instead of a big " " go " , " I 'm going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie . If the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it , it would have been an incredible film worthy of the Thunderbirds name . However , we get a movie that only die-hard Thunderbirds fans ( if you 'd like to watch your childhood torn to pieces ) or the extremely bored should bother with.My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 쩍 stars . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Where do I start ? Per the title of this film I expected some degree of authenticity , in the end I was severally let down . This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene , rather it is a Hollywood ( or pick your film making hub ) story loosely based on some real life characters . I should have had a clue when I heard a heavy English accent giving the intro to the movie in German ; the blood red text ( title , artists ) should have been the 2nd clue . The story line is contrived ( Lale was not tricked out of Switzerland Rolf Liebermann 's parents , there is no info that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany , the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the NS regime not while under control , the record played at the station was picked up in Vienna while a Lt. was there on leave , etc , etc ) the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames ( SS black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions , these went away from daily use once the war started , etc ) , the characters are stereo types ( SA bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power ) . Don 't waste your time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really didn 't like this film . The plot was very predictable . Typical American plot , I 'm sorry . Guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end . And London has a Monorail ? Bank of London ? ? ? Bank of England is what it really is ! ! - I did however like the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves . And the Brits were baddies ? ( apart from Parker and Lady Penelope ) What was up with that ? Oh and they kept on saying stuff like " " Here come ' The Thunderbirds ' " " - but it was never known as ' The Thunderbirds ' in the series , why do that ? ? I 'd like to see this re-made in 20 years with more British cast . I preferred the original series . Sorry ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I guess the previous " " House " " movie was a hit , prompting Universal to wring a few more drops from the monster cash-cow . The creative team must 've been in a recycling mood , starting with the opening theme lifted from ' Son of Frankenstein ' and some of the stock footage dispersed through the film , like one unintentionally funny bit of business where footage of Glenn Strange as the monster is mixed with clips of Karloff from 1935 's Bride , and compared to how robotic Strange moved , Karloff seems to move like a cheetah in comparison.Previous film continuity is thrown by the wayside , concerning the miraculous death-cheating abilities of the Wolf Man and Dracula , but when Dr. Edelmann & Larry Talbot discover Frankenstein 's monster with the skeleton representing Boris Karloff , Edward T. Lowe does at least acknowledge some of the past movie history , though Talbot curiously never mentions having met Karloff 's Dr. Niemann . Since this was to be the last of Universal 's horror cycle , the supernatural elements of The Wolf Man and Drac get ( unconvincingly ) morphed into medical ailments . Drac is told he suffers from a blood disease , a very rare sickness that allows him to transform into a bat or evaporate if sunlight touches him . > : - ] And Larry Talbot just has a little pressure on the brain . Of course all of this is painstakingly explained with a ' lot ' of medical jargon being related in many scenes throughout . This proves to be the biggest hindrance , as somewhere along the way the filmmakers seem to forget about actual horror or entertainment in favor of giving the monsters conditions that seem as treatable as a flu . As a huge fan of the old Universal horrors , it 's rare that I feel so bored while watching one . The whole thing just feels like a movie that was made just because it could be , but if this mess hadn 't been slapped together , the monsters might never have met Abbott and Costello , so I guess some good came of this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When you 're making a thriller about witchcraft , I believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work . Some pictures ( " " Rosemary 's Baby " , " for example ) have accomplished this ; others ( like " " Necromancy " " ) haven 't and the potentially scary material comes across as corny and goofy . This film does have some atmospheric moments , but about half the dialogue is hard to make out ( sometimes it 's poorly recorded , at other times just incomprehensible ) and Orson Welles , who gets top billing , has a role that is so BENEATH him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work . Or maybe he was simply having fun ..... ( * 1 / 2 ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Disappointing heist movie indeed , I was actually expecting a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff going on through out the movie and it does have few of those cat and mouse stuff going on , but it was just pretty stupid . And it basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer , as a matter of fact if you seen the trailer to this , you basically seen the whole film cause it is just that predictable . So basically the plot is about a few armored truck company workers that try to steal the 42 million dollars they are suppose to transport , until one of the members grows a conscience . I thought the movie would be better with it 's cast of well known actors , but I was wrong . I mean this isn 't necessarily a bad film but it just wasn 't that good either or has any depth . This is most definitely a rental at best , just not really worth seeing it in theaters. heist 4.8 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney wasn 't in the role . Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES ? I mean , it 's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too , but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama . The boys work great with Garfield . A nice sequence was the whole " " swimming " " scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment : Claude Rains was grossly miscast .

" The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history . This movie bored me . It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots . Here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them . It comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties . Mind you , she is torn between cultures and doesn 't have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real . She is listening to ever-so-many voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of Iran .

" Horrible ending - and I can 't believe Moore spent a year coming up with it . Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs , which Hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks . This was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3.5 years . Now , the first 1.5 hours were action packed , though absurd in the premise , and then it deteriorated into a slow , painful , sophomoric dissolution of the series . Unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was . Were we to think more deeply ? If I wanted a lesson in a-materialism , I would reread Daniel Quinn 's Ishmael . Absurd to think 38K people would give up everything for a " " fresh start " . " Absurd to throw in a disappearing Kara , and a reappearing Baltar and Six . Absurd to throw in the Mitochondrial Eve .

" The worst thing I have ever watch.The movie is pure trash . All the things is bad on this movie . The direction , screenplay , arts , cinematography , cast or anything else.May I say more ? The main character is an boy . It has to have 20 years of age approximately , but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years old , in addition he is an very bad actor.The editing tries to save it , but with that very bad material in hands they can 't do miracles.As I said , the cast is poor , the text is poor , that it doesn 't help the actors.I learned how to " " do not " " make a movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The guy mentioned to sue for the 1.5 hours wasted of his life , i cant disagree on that one . The movie started as some kind of class project cam thing , and ended up in a dark room. whenever the girls where fully nude there magically appeared light all over , I know i dint write the script or having anything to say about it . But this one is like a bad remake copy of saw with a bad ending . To think of a man who actually wrote this story , sick . This is really a shocking movie cant say ist horror cause its not . Its mere the brutality and the violence that made me sick . It really is frustrating to watch a movie without ending , its like bang , in your face. the movie is done now you can go home. cons -cam -lighting ( althrue i think is was supposed to ) -overdone -sickeningcons -real in your face -acting was good in my opinion -it sucks you inOverall The movie is NOT my taste of movie the witer wanted us to know that these things happen , and the man wrote his own little fantasy . If you ever saw the movies saw ? they all had a moment of comfort in it something to hold on to . This one ? does not . Maybe its just me , that im too soft but this movie made me tremble , and the story is real short , sick man kills girls slowly . But the actors sucked you in this movie every blow every scream you could almost feel it.And to be honest , i was to quick to judge about this one , its a terrible movie ? no its not. its an overdone example of reality , this is a real as it could get . But don 't watch this movie if you expect great mystery or a real plot , or even some kind of story. man gets girls in a dark room and kills em one by one , thats really it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The premise of the movie had much going for it , however , despite the novelty of models selling off someone else 's furniture to live the high life , this movie has nothing going for it . The characters are cardboard . The dialog is so painfully scripted , it 's hard to sit through , and if there were any jokes in the movie , I missed them . Marilyn Monroe 's walking into walls because she doesn 't want to wear glasses is completely unbelievable & not funny . Grable 's stupidity is also too ham-fisted to be believed . Bacall 's gold-digging is so forced , it 's annoying to listen to . Why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who 's been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands .

While outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather ( Greg Grunberg ) mistreats his mother , won 't let her near the darkroom in his basement & acts suspicious in general.While the general ' mystery ' of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it 's revealed , I found Mr. Diamond 's acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout . ( In the interest of full disclosure , I 've been a huge fan of his since Homicide and his brief , but extremely pivotal , role in The Shield up through Journeyman & Dollhouse ) Not a great film nor a good one , but serviceable enough .

The plot isn 't even the worst part of this movie ..... its the acting , camera work , lighting , and sound. there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. whoever paid to have this film made is broke now . I hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie .

" First of all , I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest films I have ever seen . I have watched it almost 10 times just because I 've wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims . It has the captivating essence of a hand-held camera recording of a distant nephew 's seventh birthday . It has all the writing of a WWE match . And most of all , it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk . This movie is a masterpiece.The film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three , drunken teens in the desert . This scene convinced me that I was onto something big when I picked this film from the DVD rack ( being drawn to the box because of the graphic of a velociraptor yelling the word " " RAPTOR " " on the front of it ) . The scene contains such treasures as tomato sauce , spaghetti intestines , vain attempts at humour and rubbery dinosaur puppets that repeat throughout the course of the movie . This movie is a masterpiece.The film contains erratic backdrops and prop use that causes one 's mind to melt at the thought that someone could just have so little shame when it comes to creating a film . An example is when a truck , in the middle of the night , is parked beside a cliff wall . The very next day , they find it in an open grassy area . The driver couldn 't have driven it there since he had his face bitten off by an unnamed bipedal carnivore ( I will explain why it 's unnamed in a second ) . So , my only guess is that either the velociraptor drove it , the livestock the driver was transporting did it , or Jim Wynorski doesn 't think very highly of his viewers . Hell , in one part they expect me to believe that they are walking down a main street at night when the road doesn 't have gutters , the fire hydrant is precariously placed next to a phone booth , and there 's only a single street light . Yet , still , I feel compelled to watch and re-watch this film , just so I can find more things that will make me giggle the next time I watch it . This film is a masterpiece.The directing on this film is horrific . Long extended pauses . Strange cuts to characters that weren 't even in the general vicinity of the conversation . People discussing things casually while facing the camera ( and in turn , making them face the wall ) . They can 't even give the dinosaur a coherent species , flipping between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor puppet ( distinguished by the intensely long , fat , disproportionate claw ) . This film is a masterpiece.The editing is prominent on this film . This is not a good thing . I am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films , masterfully crafted into a single piece of crap , but there has to be a limit ! Sub plots end as abruptly as they began . Explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters not being limited to , well , not being explained at all ! And an ending that felt like driving a muscle car into a brick wall without a seat belt . You just never know what is going to happen because the film doesn 't follow a coherent structure . This film is a masterpiece.Now , I 'm going to just have to mention a single scene ( the greatest one ) that occurs near the end . This is a spoiler , but not really . The final scene contains a showdown between tyrannosaurus rex and Sheriff Tanner . It is like the showdown between Sigourney Weaver and the Alien Queen in Aliens , except without all the emotional power / budget / epic battling . It pretty consists of Tanner ramming the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery . A white bobcat . In a space of several minutes , through a series of sneakily slipped in cuts , the director manages to turn that white bobcat into a yellow forklift / crane looking piece of machinery . Now , as I said , I know that this film is made from scenes from other films , but what two films warrant a showdown with a t-rex in a construction vehicle ? This film is a masterpiece.This film gets a 1 / 10 for quality of film making , but a 10 / 10 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy myself . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched the DVD ( called BLACK WIDOW in the U.S.A. ) and felt afterward that it was , indeed , a truly awful movie . But they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film , or I missed a lot . The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity ( not even a breast ) , but I 've read several other comments on IMDb.com mentioning the vulgarity and something about a tampon . I did not see anything like that , just a bad , boring film with unlikable characters and a trite , sophomoric plot . Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or Botoxed to the gills , and nary an expression touches her face . And her name makes me think of super-sizing a beverage at Taco Bell : " " I 'll have the Cola Grande !

" This really doesn 't do the blues justice . It starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell ( or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson ? Someone blind anyway ) apparently narrating from outer space ( ? ) and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians . Corny as it is , this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary . Afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes , filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of Beck and Shemekia Copeland raping the same songs afterwards . This is a good device to show us why the old Blues greats were really so great , but it doesn 't make for compelling viewing . There is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play . Nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments .

" A movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun , romantic and easy-going entertainment .

I was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good . It wasn 't.But , on the other hand , if you 're old enough to remember Power Rangers , you might spot some familiar faces during the film . Presumably to save on production costs , Saban ( who also make Power Rangers ) , decided to liberally sprinkle old monster costumes from everyone 's favourite tacky toy-spawning franchise throughout the film . I spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes I saw from when I was a kid , so I guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia value.But , if you want to see actual Power Rangers monsters , go watch Power Rangers itself .

I really was hoping it 'd be over by now ( not to mention canceled , once everything connected with the show -including the actors - had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere , never to be seen again ) , because this series really is dire . To have this program listed under the genre of ' comedy ' is at best misleading ! It 's so hard to believe Ben Elton could write something this bad , maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he 's been connected with before . In some episodes I haven 't even laughed once ! Oh , and I can 't believe Ardal O 'Hanlon actually stopped doing ' My hero ' & started doing this instead , his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day - perhaps he simply can 't read , and didn 't realise just how poor the scripts for ' Blessed ' were . Don 't get me wrong , ' My Hero ' is not masterpiece , but it 's a million times better than this piece of junk.And just to annoy me even more I bet this gets a DVD release as well , when there are so many great TV series ' that aren 't getting released ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Rich ditzy Joan Winfield ( a woefully miscast Bette Davis ) is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical Allen Brice ( Jack Carson looking lost ) . Her father ( Eugene Palette ) is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins ( James Cagney . Seriously ) . They crash land in the desert and hate each other but ( sigh ) start falling in love.This seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because Cagney and Davis are in it . They were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas NOT comedy and this movie shows why ! The script is just horrible--there 's not one genuine laugh in the entire movie . The running joke in this has Cagney and Davis falling rump first in a cactus ( this is done THREE TIMES ! ) . Only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated . As it is they both do their best with the lousy material . Cagney tries his best with his lines and Davis screeches every line full force but it doesn 't work . Carson has this " " what the hell " " look on his face throughout the entire movie ( probably because his characters emotions change in seconds ) . Only Palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles . But , all in all , this was dull and laughless--a real chore to sit through .

It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing . Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others . The problem isn 't with direction , acting or anything technical .

" This is a re-imagining of Tarzan in the era of the Soloflex and Apocalypse Now . There 's nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the Tarzan legend . There 's nothing inherently wrong with the premise that Tarzan doesn 't speak . There 's plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an African jungle in 1910 , could be this offensively stupid and plastic . Bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a video-centerfold , as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project . If it succeeds anywhere it 's in the implication that National Geographic has influenced the way the imagery of a Tarzan movie might be constructed.It would be ridiculous to argue that movies shouldn 't employ the sexual tease as ONE of many tools to draw in viewers . Some really great film moments incorporate it . But this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum - the tease is the only thing going on here ; at the time of its release and now . You sit through awful , dumb scenes that offer no interest , and miles of footage of bad acting to drool over the next peek at either of two bodies . Yes ... Bo Derek and Miles O 'Keeffe are beautiful ( um , congratulations on having a working libido . ) but if that 's your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up . There 's only a hairs-breadth difference between the two formats and ( I 'm just guessing here ) a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter . The question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone.As a showman , John Derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife Bo in the movie " " 10 " " ; and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads . The movie itself was beside the point . He was about 20 years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid , shallow movie that was only about showcasing superficiality.As a director , John Derek appears to require only that Mrs. Derek look pleasant , empty and hump-able in every scene . It 's hideously shot . The camera placement is annoying . In terms of editing , the entire ' wipe ' catalog is exhausted . The credit sequence is garish . And it 's a toss-up as to who commits the worse screen offense ; Bo Derek who 's such a bimbo that she can 't even figure out how to play a bimbo , or Richard Harris who shouts every line ( as he likes to do ) until you want to shoot him . At least with Bo you can imagine her blaming some horny writer for shortchanging her . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I picked it up at a thrift store for fifty cents.The Used Movie Sale ! sticker covers much of the front cover artwork , meaning that what I see is a truly odd blended still of the front of the Cyclone super bike , a car flipping over on fire , and Heather Thomas , wearing Flouncy Eighties Hair with her mouth open in an expression that says , " " I ' ave a ' ooth ache .

" " The case , honestly , was enough ( " " with nowhere to turn and no one to trust , Teri is plunged headlong into a maze of danger and deceit " " ) , but I surprised myself by actually getting around to watching it . I always make time for the really bad films . That " " Fight Club " " tape can wait.Meet Teri . Teri is a stunningly well-crafted character , as we can tell from her introduction , in which she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and , later , her legwarmers . Then Teri goes off to hook up with her boyfriend for the evening that goes horribly wrong . Before she knows it , Teri is driven " " straight into a web of deadly double-crosses in CYCLONE . " " The VHS box tells it like it is.Left out of the box summary - perhaps out of some faint hope that actual copies of this film would be sold - is how awful the acting is . It might have been just me , but I kept thinking I could read the characters ' thoughts through their eyes . " " This is dumb , " " thinks Heather Thomas . " " I know , " " thinks Bad Guy with Too-Wide Mouth.A driving force ( no pun intended ) for the second half of this epic picture are the car chases . Those were actually pretty good , although I 'm inclined that gasoline doesn 't need coaching on how to explode . What really impressed me is that , in all the chases , the streets were pretty much empty . It 's like there are only twenty people in this huge city.I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking , " " Gee Wilikers ! I have to see this movie ! " " The sad thing , though , is that you can 't find it . Oh no . " " Cyclone " " is a film that finds YOU . Just wait . Some day - perhaps during lunch , perhaps late in the evening , perhaps " " when military scientist Jeffery Combs ( ' Re-Animator ' ) is murdered by hired assassins " " - you will hear the rustle of legwarmers , and know that it is time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This title seems more like a filming exercise than a film that should have been released to be seen by the public . For Dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time , without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it . I felt like it was 90mins wasted as I waited anxiously for a plot to develop , or even begin.Try to fit this film into a genre and you won 't , because it lacks a beginning , middle or ending . I 've seen ' arty ' movies before and this doesn 't even come close to being arty , abstract or original , it just seems to me to be completely pointless.I think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group .

" I like the " " Star Wars " " series . I like a good , cheapo sci-fi flick every once in a while , too . Heck , I even like the Roger Corman-produced nickel-and-dime jobbies.I do NOT like " " The Ice Pirates " , " though . For one , it just looks too cheap , you know ? For a movie that 's supposed to take place in outer space , it feels cramped and closed-in like it 's being filmed in the front seat of someone 's Mazda . And the special effects , while appropriately cheesy , look more than anything like foam rubber painted metallic gray.Usually , I don 't let things like that bother me , especially if the story and the characters are worthwhile.They ain 't.The whole storyline , about these ne 'er-do-well space pirates who decide to find a planet loaded with ice they can melt down and sell as water ( a hot commodity in the future , I guess ) is about as original as the jokes , which is not a compliment.The humor comes in at about crotch-level ( like that castrating machine you 'll see early on ) , and everyone seems to have a cranky attitude . And who told John Matuzak that he was funny ? Whoever did , shame on them . Good old Robert Urich tries , but he 's a reliable actor on board a badly sinking ship ( or starship , in this case ) . I watched this one about three times and ended up feeling the same way every time - shanghaied.No stars . In spite of of the presence of Huston ( one year prior to " " Prizzi 's Honor " " ) and Carradine ( at the tail end of a once-lofty career ) , these " " Pirates " " should walk the plank . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie is a crappy and forgettable Sean Connery vehicle . The performances are generally crappy especially by Capshaw , Fishburne , and the usually solid Ed Harris . Connery seems miscast as a Harvard Academic . The movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along . It is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels . The movie squanders an excellent supporting cast . George Plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to Connery as they debate the death penalty . The violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery / thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree . The scripting and direction are extremely poor .

When I herd about the Bell Witch , I wanted to believe . I read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story . But this movie just destroyed that .

" I mean the word " " pedestrian " . " Seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen . Faith Domergue can do better than this . She is supposed to be the mysterious , vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson ( there 's an idea , eh ? ) . Instead she 's a common would-be housewife of the fifties , and the single , flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before Faith had her coffee . As for the rest of the cast , they are all so earnestly " " all-American " " that the result is laughable . This is ground more productively covered in Val Lewton in " " The Cat People " . " I think " " Cult of the Cobra " " should really be titled " " Cult of the Contractual Obligation " .

" Not very impressed . Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film , because there is almost no development in the plot . Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . The acting seems very poor as well , and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television . Although this is difficult to tell with the female role , Yuwen , as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time . Tian Zhuangzhuang 's film the ' Blue Kite ' was a far better film . But don 't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late ' 40s . Unlike the Blue Kite , the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself , the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop.I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can 't tell the difference between a film that is ' beautiful ' ' profound ' or ' hypnotic ' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial.If any film fits the description of ' overrated , ' this is it .

These two worlds do not belong together . I do not want to see a bunch of ancient barbarian looking people dancing to some rock song on the car radio . I have a sense of humor , but this is just stupid . This is what Hollywood does to good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas . Don 't give up though , the Eye of Braxus is much , much better .

" I 've always liked Fred MacMurray , and혰although her career was tragically cut short혰I think Carole Lombard is fun to watch .

Skid 's a great trumpeter , so he embarks on a musical career , which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall . During his climb to musical stardom , he neglects Maggie , who later inspires him to start over after he 's hit rock bottom . Ah , yes혚it 's the true Hollywood happy ending , which comes none too soon.Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success , but this movie is so predictable and slow-paced that it 's difficult to watch at times . The early scenes set in Panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever , and later an alcoholic Skid just wanders endlessly in New York . Fred and Carole try their best , but the tired script and S-L-O-W direction just don 't give them a chance . Even the final scene , in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment , just doesn 't ring true.This movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars MacMurray and Lombard . However , I guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Return to Sender , a.k.a. Convicted , is almost imperfect . The one good thing about this particular film was that I was never bored . That being said , the reviews that hail this movie as a low-budget success may not have watched the same movie that I saw.Rather than write a review and tell you what happens and what works and doesn 't work , I will simply comment that nothing works . There are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi through . The acting in the film is not very good , although that may be a result of a script so poorly worded that it could have been ghost written by George Lucas . There was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate . Did I mention that there were some plot holes ? By the end of the movie , you are wondering how a blind guy can be such a good shot with a shotgun , why Kelly Preston trusts Aidan Quinn , why she would fall asleep the night before her client is supposed to be killed , how Aidan Quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that keeps breaking down during the rest of the movie , why Aidan Quinn didn 't by a fifth instead of a bunch of nips , etc.With all that being said , this is certainly a B-movie , and a terrible one at that .

He has very little charisma and just about anyone could do what he does in this show . The worse thing about this piece of crap , is the fact that a lot of the phone calls are reenacted , so not only are they apparently conning the poor people on the other end of the phone , but they are also conning the audience who don 't have enough time to read the " " disclaimed " " that flickers across the screen for about half a second at the beginning at the end of the show !

" Full House is one of the worst TV series ever ! Why ? Because all the characters are so irritating that it 's impossible to bear.The best character is Joey an even he is pretty irritating occasionally.An that girl DJ , who wrote her character ? I want to kill my self every time she speaks.Not to mention when Danny start 's with his philosophy.Example : DJ won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino.However , she 's not eighteen so she shouldn 't gamble according to law.However the casino was ready to pay her the money but then Danny , her father cought 's her and don 't let 's her raise that money because she is not eighteen.Oh come on , give me a break , will ya ?

Every single word they say in this series seem 's like Shakespeare wrote it.Except that Shakespere knew how to write and except that he wouldn 't be that childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the Full House ! For everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world , i deeply recommend ' Do not watch the Full House ' !

Anything above 8 would be odd.Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured , though she overdid the New Yorker accent but other times her southern ( Virginia & NC ) accent did sneak through .

" Well ! What can one say ? Firstly , this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours , for the complexity ( or lack of such ) of the plot . The actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available . Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character at all . After seeing Sean Connery 's interpretation of the great man in " " The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen " , " Swayzee really does not make the grade . This chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength , stature , subtlety , or humour needed for the part , and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor , who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast . Some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography . For example . When the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert , their tracks are visible down to the oasis , just waiting for them to walk in them . Climbing out of the mine leads to an exit ( on the next shot ) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through , et cetera . I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment . In some ways I wish he had . The leader of the Russians pursuing Quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything . Swayzee does quite well as the sad father , returned to London , who is unable to obtain the custody of his son . Swayzee should stick to that sort of thing . He is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart , experience of life , and sense of fair play.4 out of 10 . Barely , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I actually liked this movie until the end . Sure , it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon . Until the end , that is . For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students , what does the main character do ? Wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition ? No . She tortures and butchers the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable Brittany Spears-wannabe pop song . My ears bled !

" I nearly fell asleep during a screening of this . Of a boring story that seems to go on forever , it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks . After a heated affair , the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways.The male prostitute then goes on a downward self-destructive spiral trying to find his " " one true love " , " repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented , looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his love.In the meanwhile , he hooks up with one ugly guy ( who I thought was also a male prostitute ) , a gay basher , and some guy who ends up having a " " three-second sexual intercourse session " " with him in a back alley.It never ceases to amaze me how films STILL portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds , such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants unbuckled before thrusting three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm ! All of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them , to which he discards their telephone numbers.There is a brief side-plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle . There is also another brief side-plot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window . And there is also one more brief side-plot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance , but the audience is not advised of his relation to this person.None of these things really connect with each other , only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is . He seems to be living life like a ghost . There was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him rummaging through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the world 's saddest song on it.Otherwise , this movie just seems to go on forever . Filmed in black and white , it may seem very dreamlike , but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmare ! I found the ending to be confusing as I wasn 't quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven ? That would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe . But seeing as this is an " " independent film " , " movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to " " use your imagination " . " For those of you who are seeking out nudity , there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are artfully concealed within the shadows . In other words , don 't waste your time with this one.My Rating - 2 out of 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" badly directed garbage. a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest ... if you are the sort of person who likes that ... see a shrink. even if you are that person it doesn 't make this a good film , the acting is really poor , the story full of plot holes , the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one . I can see why people dislike uwe boll .. we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them , which is really sad ! A complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates .

" My reasoning behind viewing this film ( despite the fact that it was free ) , was more or less out of curiosity ... slight , slight curiosity ... I wasn 't all that familiar with this straight-to-video " " biographical " " account of Mr. Gein and discovered during the opening credits that it featured horror icon Kane Hodder in the starring role . My emotions turned from not just curiosity , but now a glimmer of mild anticipation as to how his portrayal of Gein would turn out . Also in the credits ( among some grim photos of Ed 's crimes ) was Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns . " " Okay " , " I thought to myself ... " " This may be mildly amusing " . " As the movie started and progressed ( slowly ) , my microscopic confidence ( or as I call it , " " micro-hope " " ) for this movie faded entirely and I was stuck with an overwhelming feeling of humiliation as I died a little inside from watching this dung heap . Hodder , who is widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer , inaccurately puts that into play here - turning Eddie Gein from a mild-mannered recluse , to a hulking , full-blown killing machine . He lurks by night , killing cemetery caretakers , his grave robbing buddy and teenage girls , leaving Plainfield in a panic as the local Sheriff 's department seems to do nothing to adjust the dangerous situation in the least . The deputy and his mom have a warm little relationship that gave me a fuzzy feeling inside ( or that could have just been the cyanide pill I ingested halfway through this turkey ) . I 'm not sure what the point of this movie was and obviously the director knew nothing about the subject he was working with . There is already such an abundance of films pertaining to Gein 's story that , unless the " " Ed Gein Snuff Footage " " is discovered , I don 't want to see anymore of these on the shelves . If you want a more authentic film of this nature than check out 2001 's " " Ed Gein ( aka In the Light of the Moon ) " . " , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was crap with a capital " " C. " " The opening scene showed promise . But that " " promise " " was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going.And the wooden statue , Morty , who was rather creepy in the original film , looks plain goofy in this one . It was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume . ( And by the way , who else thinks " " Morty " " is one of the most un-scary names on planet earth ? It ranks right up there with " " Jimmy " " or " " Fred " " when it comes to horror value . Or why not just name the wooden statute Henry-freakin ' -Kissinger . " " Run , it 's Dr. Kissinger ! " " That 'd be about as scary as " " Morty . ) And then there 's a scene where the " " hero " " hits his father 's tombstone with--- " " a sledgehammer ? " " you might guess-- " " a two-by-four ? " " someone might venture . No , he angrily beats his father 's tombstone with a twig---a freakin ' twig . But worse than that , once the characters walk away , the tombstone actually , and inexplicably , bleeds . Oh brother ! There 's also a Native American guy who lives with the main character 's grandparents , but apparently , does nothing except Morty-maintenance . He perpetuates creepy Morty-legends , warns those who scoff , and even fixes Morty 's arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank . But for all his respect for and tenderness toward Morty , does Morty give a rat 's hairy behind ? No.The movie drags on , and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears ( sort of ) . This film is a real yawner . Don 't rent it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Being an American service member please believe me when I say that this movie in no way accurately portrays the emotional state of our Soldiers / Sailors / Airmen / Marines returning from deployments.That being said ....

" Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard-earned dollars . Suggestion ? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let 's just say that good old TheatreX took one for the team on this one . Guess what the plots about ? Zombies taking over . This time though , for the sake of originality ( ? ) this film takes place in Rhode Island , and to be honest I 'm not sure I 've ever seen a zombie flick based in Rhode Island . A TV station , controlled by the government , is supposedly keeping up " " normal " " broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won 't think that there 's any problem in the world , that is , those that never look or go outside , anyway . I will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film . There is actually somewhat of a story to this but I 'm not bothering with that because after a while you 'll either not care or have fallen asleep . At any rate , this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the " " seen it all before " " stuff that gets trotted out before the camera . Trust me , you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this . 3 out of 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Target is the story of a special agent who , after carrying out orders to assassinate Turkish " " Terrorists " " ( note that this is one of those American " " movies for guys who love mindless nationalistic super-patriotic crap movies " " ) , returns home to find that his ex-wife and two kids are taking hostage . Charlie Snow has just a couple of hours to do whatever the terrorists tell him in order to get them back.This was by far one of THE worst movies I have ever seen . And , had it not been for someone I know actually ( and probably , mistakenly ) taking it out of the video store , I would never have watched this giant pile of garbage to begin with.The movie plays out like any generic action movie story I have ever seen before . In fact , these are the kind of things they spoof on variety shows , that is how bad it is . I half expected In Living the Color 's ' Homey the Clown ' to Mad TV 's Will Sasso doing his Steven Segal impression to bust out on the screen half way through , to remind you that this was just an exaggerated action movie , but now our characters are here to spoof how ridiculous it really is . There were not even any good fighting or action sequences . By the way things are played out , you wouldn 't even think that anyone was kidnapped , that there were any terrorists , or that anything remotely interesting was going on.Not only is the story completely and utterly uninteresting , the acting is so terribly wooden . Just watch the part where Stephen Baldwin , as former special agent Charlie Snow , is talking to the kidnappers on the telephone . They tell him that they have his wife , and they put her on the phone . She says " " Charlie , help ! " " or something to that effect . And Baldwin replies " " it 's okay , honey " " in such a deadpan manner , you think he was reading the script and trying to sound out the words phonetically . I imagine that , despite being such a ridiculously bad movie ( one that belongs on the bottom 100 on IMDb--a list that they should expand to at least 250 movies and should contain nearly every Stephen Baldwin movie ) , someone with some talent could have at least made the effort not to ham it up as much . Someone . Anyone . I couldn 't get past the fact that everyone sounded like they were reading from a script . Save that is , the only person in the whole friggin movie who has any talent whatsoever ( and thus should not have been in this ) , Mad TV 's Deborah Wilson.This was the capital cheese fest .

" I purchased this movie on blu-ray because it promised great visuals and music . I was also a great fan of a similar movie ... Baraka . The movie is very much styled after Baraka , wide angles , very similar shots with cameras set to capture long time passage in each shot . Even some of the scenes were identical ( the street with traffic ) . Whereas Baraka told a great story , juxtaposing nature , man-made environments , spirituality , and horrors of the world in an engrossing fashion and great music , this movie just jumped from shot to shot with no encompassing story , mediocre musical score , and then .... POOF , it 's finished ! I thought there must be some sort of mistake ! History of the world ? Half the movie is Egypt and landscape ( looks like Arizona , but I didn 't bother to check ) .

... " and you can look at that statement in different ways , by the way . First of all , it 's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes . Your wildest imagination doesn 't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here . Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick , disgusting , offensive , brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out . Now , I love horror movies and I am very ' pro-violence ' , but I do think that it has to lead somewhere ! ! Is that too much to ask ? Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts . The " " movie " " contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story . This results in endless showing of torture , murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common . Not very informative , if you ask me . And yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely HAS potential . It 's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial . Personally , I think that is an interesting topic , so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever.Secondly , the whole production of this movie was a mess . They didn 't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts ... Tons of it ! ! The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I 've ever seen . Any other special effects besides the make-up looks very amateurish ( Like that attempt to a realistic car crash , for example ) . There 's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere ... not even an attempt to build up one.Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least . With the presence of death-metal icon Danni Filth ( from the band Cradle of filth .. get the link ? ) this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial . Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this . And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing ... Bah . I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you 're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind .

" Unentertaining , uninvolving hybrid of " " Cruel Intentions " " and " " Wild Things " , " but it isn 't nearly as good as either of those trash min-classics .

As he digs deeper he thinks it 's much more than it at first glance seems to be . We follow Alicia , the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well . At about 90 minutes , if this film was welcomed to begin with , it would have worn it out . This film brings absolutely nothing new to the table . But it IS the only movie thus far that has Miss Swain topless so the grade is higher just for that.My Grade : DEye Candy : Dominique Swain gets topless ( fixing a mistake of " " Happy Campers " " ) ; another girl is topless Anti-Eye candy : more men ass than girl tit , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10 . Sam Mraovich wrote , directed , stared , and produced this movie .

" Anyone remember the docudrama THREADS ? It 's a drama documentary which shocked Britain in September 1984 . Whilst not exactly wholly entertained by Mick Jackson 's nuclear holocaust horror film I could respect it . Unfortunately I can 't respect this docudrama broadcast 20 years later which deals with terrorists letting off a radioactive dirty bomb in the centre of London The problem I have with it is that director Daniel Percival production values are far too good when in fact this would have benefited from rather cheap production values . The cinematography is superb but in this type of speculative drama do we need superb and well lit Oscar standard cinematography ? What we certainly don 't need is a musical score as the survivors of the blast slowly stagger out of the smoke . Neither do we need vaguely well known cast members . Did anyone else sit there asking themselves " " Hey what was he in ? I know that face " " several times ? I know I did and it 's very distracting . Perhaps the biggest production flaw with DIRTY WAR is that someone decided to make it a docudrama with too much stylistic emphasis on the drama . In THREADS the action cuts away from the action in Sheffield umpteen times and becomes an edition of HORIZON on the effects of nuclear war before cutting back to the fictional protagonists again and THREADS is very effective because of this . Here the information presented suffocates the drama which drowns in expositional and totally unconvincing dialogue . The characters in the teleplay aren 't really characters they 're just cyphers there to inform the audience what happens when radioactive material is exploded . It would have been better for the action to cut to captions to convey this type of information ala THREADS . The worse thing is that director Daniel Percival used the same technique as seen in THREADS a couple of years ago with his docudrama about smallpox . He should have used the same style with DIRTY WARI should also lay my cards on the table and state that while I don 't consider most Muslims are terrorists I am getting slightly fed up of TV productions like THE HAMBURG CELL , THE GRID and DIRTY WAR having to point out this fact to me by whalloping me over the head with it which is somewhat typical of patronising PC attitudes in TV companies nowadaysI managed to miss the studio debate that Bob mentions here but I have also heard it discussed elsewhere and I can 't help thinking it makes better viewing than DIRTY WAR itself with its heated arguments between differing factions of the political spectrum . If DIRTY WAR is remembered twenty years from now ( Highly unlikely I know ) it may well be remembered for the discussion it caused more than anything , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this film at its New York 's High Falls Film Festival screening as well and I must say that I found it a complete and awful bore . Although it was funny in some places , the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden , especially the " " Lovely Lady " " and the voice of the narrator ( whom I have never heard of ) had a lot to be desired . J.C.Mac was , I felt , the redeeming feature of this film , true action and grit and ( out of the cast ) the only real acting . I am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing , this could have been a half decent film . Let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release , or if you really want a copy , look in the bargain bin in Lidl . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Hayek and Farrell , and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors , they just don 't have anything to say or anything to react to . Even the earthquake was pretty poor .

And he even buries Camilla out in the desert , instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while . Pathetic . And the L.A. set was ridiculously graphically created . Anything good ? The window to his apartment felt real , the curtains , the sounds , the wind . And Donaldson is always great .

" Veber is not renown for his outstanding directorial skills . In fact nobody cares as long as they got the laughs , quite a few here to be honest , scattered in the whole process , thanks to Depardieu 's half-wit characterization and the dialogue Veber puts in his mouth.But this is not enough to make a great comedy since there 's no movie outside of the usual Veber premise : a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character . In L 'Emmerdeur , La Ch챔vre or Les Comp챔res there was a real story going on over the fire vs. water proceedings . Le Diner de cons , although it was a play , managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe Pinon would cause . In Tais-toi the backstory about the vengeance is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest . Plus the heavies are lame both on screen and in the script.Now what 's wrong ? Veber wraps this up creating no action , no rhythm . Instead he uses systematically and overuses ellipses ( maybe he met William Goldman in Hollywood ) and the ' music ' really stresses that lack of nerve and a backbone in the story.So you 'll have to be content with Depardieu 's performance . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Two escaped convicts step out of the woods and shoot two campers in the head . That 's the first scene , and it made me wince , fearing what was in store . But by the end of the first half hour I was all swept up in the flood of images . Not because I cared in the least about any of the characters but because I was aghast at how execrable the film was and was curious to see how truly low it could sink.Frank ( Remar ) and Red ( Woolvett ) are the ex-inmates . After murdering the two innocent campers they plow through the woods and wangle their way into the isolated cabin of Dean Stockwell and his two sons , the attorney Keith and the estranged homosexual Behr . The escapees at first pretend their car has broken down and they need to use the phone , but they gradually reveal their identities.Well , it looks like familiar territory so far . " " Desperate Hours , " " or " " Funny Games " " maybe . But -- hang on -- the gay son is in cahoots with the two . It seems that Stockwell , upon discovering his son in flagrante delicto with another man named Billy , kicked Billy around and threw him out . Billy went on to die and Behr now blames his Dad for the death . And , indeed , Dad is something of a Neanderthal when it comes to paraphilias , the fact that he was just found cohabiting with a secretary notwithstanding.The grief-stricken Behr just searched and searched , looking for someone else who had known Billy , someone with whom he could share his despair . It turned out to be one of the escapees , and now Behr is determined to see them to their freedom.It gets all twisted after that . People talk . They talk and talk . They talk continually . And NOT about the two mad killers who just can 't wait to put one between their eyes . No -- the dialog goes something like , " " You were just so scared of something inside yourself that you even drove away your own SON . " " That 's Behr , the young gay guy , talking to Stockwell . It 's as if an afternoon domestic drama had had its genes mixed with a killer thriller in some kind of transformational device or cocktail shaker.The only real performance is given by James Remar as the more talkative and ominous of the two escapees . And that 's mainly because of his gruff but fluid baritone , which sounds like Lance Henrickson 's , and his wide guppy-like lips . He 's easy on the eyes and ears.Dean Stockwell has given decent performances , including his inestimable bizarro turn in " " Blue Velvet , " " in which he was my supporting player , but here laziness , advancing years , or slack direction has shaped his every move and every utterance into a stereotype . It 's as if he were reading stage directions -- " " Look surprised " " and " " shout angrily " " -- and following them literally . There 's not a surprise in a cartload.If the gay son , Jason Behr , ever blinked , it must have been while I was blinking at the same time because I missed it . He has a long neck and just one expression in his instrument . Woolvett as the secondary villain fades into the pine-knot paneled woodwork . The attorney son is Robert Glen Keith . I hope he didn 't quit his day job.The direction is pedestrian , the staging functional without being in the least innovative . Sometimes it 's confusing . I lost track of where everyone was supposed to be as the killers are circling around on the cabin 's porch and the family has locked itself inside with a shotgun . I also couldn 't understand how Stockwell could put a blast through the cabin 's door , hit Remar , and knock him in a back flip off the porch , and then Remar could simply stand up , dust himself off , and come up with a cranky riposte like , " " Okay . Two can play that game . " " But why go on ? See it if you must . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I went out of my way to get this film , and was fortunate to get it on VHS . Being a big Gloria Grahame fan , it was an excellent addition to my collection . Other than that , I really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture . The plot is predictable ( and weak ) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department . Ms. Grahame is always fun to watch ( if you like her , as I do ) , but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot . She works in a dive , so let her use her own voice . It can only lend to the atmosphere . I must agree with an earlier reviewer ; the ending borrows heavily from THE BIG HEAT . To the point of detracting from the ending . I have seen worse films with Ms. Grahame ( MACAO ) , but I will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen . If you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film , this is your movie . Enjoy the picture . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is very much like every other modern horror movie . It 's predictable in the way it gets build up and progresses and just never succeeds in bringing anything original or shocking to the screen . That 's really the biggest disappointment of the movie , that overall still had a promising main concept for a movie of its sort.You can call this movie a big walking modern horror movie clich챕 . It has all of the elements in it that make modern horror movies often not so very great ones to watch . One of these aspects is a moaning and very naive little kid . Why do they keep putting this sort of stuff in movies ? Same goes for the sort of drama aspects , that involves the family . It just doesn 't work out for the movie and is far from interesting or effective . It often instead causes the movie to drag in parts and become an annoying one to watch . So it has all of the clich챕s present but it also doesn 't succeed at bringing any of these clich챕s well to the screen . As an horror movie this simply is a very poor one . It doesn 't handle its horror or tension very well . For the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy . The movie its story isn 't too well connected and build up within the movie . Too often the movie sleeps in at parts and it doesn 't ever allow its horror to fully kick in.The movie is also often way too dark ( no doubt as an attempt to hide its fairly low budget ) and it shows very little gore as well , mostly due to the fact that you simply can not always see things so very well.You can just tell by looking at this movie that director J.S. Cardone doesn 't has much talent for the genre and doesn 't know how to handle its present ingredients properly . He did some attempts in the past but all of his movies have failed so far. he just keeps trying unfortunately . Who knows , perhaps with the right people behind the camera 's ( like Tobe Hooper , who was initially attached to direct ) this movie still could had been something decent.It 's a poorly cast movie , with mostly big unknowns in it . Biggest name of the movie is Ben Cross but his role is just way too small and in a way also not really relevant enough for the movie and its story . It didn 't even seemed like he had much fun playing.Just skip it.4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want .

" I love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot . Sci-fi movies / TV are usually underfunded , under-appreciated and misunderstood . I tried to like this , I really did , but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek ( the original ) . Silly prosthetics , cheap cardboard sets , stilted dialogues , CG that doesn 't match the background , and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a ' sci-fi ' setting . ( I 'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV . It 's not . It 's clich챕d and uninspiring . ) While US viewers might like emotion and character development , sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously ( cf . Star Trek ) . It may treat important issues , yet not as a serious philosophy . It 's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish , just missing a spark of life . Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable , often painful to watch . The makers of Earth KNOW it 's rubbish as they have to always say " " Gene Roddenberry 's Earth ... " " otherwise people would not continue watching . Roddenberry 's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull , cheap , poorly edited ( watching it without advert breaks really brings this home ) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space .

" This movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured . There 's male full frontal nudity , dead animal parts , dogs licking nipples , the female loosing control of her bladder . All shot in a gray cold color . Effective , but a little too much . We then move on to seeing the BTK killer 's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes . The tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and it 's creepy . Here we don 't see fancy or good imagery , it looks as if shot with your home camera . It doesn 't look horrifying , but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling . What this movie doesn 't have is any drama , really . There are some cop scenes every once in a while , but there 's no excitement in terms of them finding the killer . There isn 't much of an arc to this story . This could have been an effective psychological thriller , a study of madness . Unfortunately , the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage . It 's dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again . Sometimes you don 't know it 's coming and don 't have enough time to look away . And that I have to reject . I 'm all for low budget horror movies but I don 't tolerate animal suffering . It was unnecessary , excessive , and comes without warning . I 'm glad that Lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does , but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore .

" Well it 's not often that we in the UK have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the Afro Caribbean community , the last example that I can remember was the underrated Babylon way back in 1980 . So I had high expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy , a film that has been touted as the British version of La Haine ! Well La Haine it is not ! I agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other British films of late , but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly.The film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in London , but I 'm concerned that film makers now use type-casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging . Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all , but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in London the only future is violence & tragedy , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It 's atrocious . Many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle , but that didn 't bother me . So much so that I didn 't even remember her until I read about the show recently . All in all , it 's miserably forgettable.The only okay thing was the theme song . Guilty pleasure , they call it ... Nananana ninja ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I 've ever seen . It utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth , inventing silly plot twists and reducing the 12 labours to ... 3 or 4 , I think . It makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers ' having ever read the myths , like changing birds to harpies , lions to sphinxes , the Oracle of Delphi to Tiresias , and bulls to a pedantic version of Proteus , even integrating aspects , never seen outside of Sam Raimi 's entertaining series , concerning his first marriage , to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the Furies so it sounds appropriate to the period.I could accept much of that , but it also fails completely in pure film standards ; most painful is the dialogue , leaden , portentous pseudo-Shakespearean tripe . It is a poor re-interpretation of the myths , making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that Crichton 's " " The 13th Warrior " " attempted in regards to the Beowulf legend , while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super-strength . A sad , sad failure of an entertainment experience , who I 'm sure many of the quality actors involved regret deeply . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Bette Davis brings her full trunk of tics to this miserable flop which is another variation on the " " hilariously mismatched " " lovers theme . Sadly , Cagney and Davis are truly mismatched in acting styles and the mix is not simply unpalatable but distasteful . The only distinction in the film comes from Eugene Pallette who , literally , phones in his usual part as the deb 's misunderstood dad . Jack Carson 's performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I actually prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles ( e.g. Good Will Hunting , The Fisher King , The World According to Garp ) . These are my favorite Robin Williams movies . But Seize the Day , although well-acted , is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie ( even worse than Death to Smoochy , Club Paradise , and Alladin on Ice ) .Every good story is going to have its ups and downs . This movie , however , is one giant down . I don 't need a feel-good Hollywood cheese-fest , but I 've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness . This movie reminds me of " " Love Liza " " ( which is actually worse ) because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall . The answer ? Who cares . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I happened to catch this movie on late night TV . I saw the opening credits and thought this looks good . Well I was very wrong . While not excruciatingly bad ( it had some funny and tender moments ) it lacked any sense of cohesion.It started off well enough with Kathy Bates 'character having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered . But Kathy has played these disaffected women so well before - think Fried Green Tomatoes . The problem wasn 't Kathy , it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place . It was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next . The script also felt very contrived.Some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it didn 't receive a cinematic release . The main reason I think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it.Having said all that I thought the small woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie , not to mention how beautiful she is . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" While it 's true that the movie is somewhat interesting , the execution leaves a lot to be desired ( much like Blood Orgy of the Leather Girls , I Spit on Your Grave , and Born in Flames , all superior ) . I don 't think it 's not porn , but porn is in the eye of the beholder : if it functions as porn for somebody , who am I to say that he / she is wrong ? I was rather puzzled by the statement in Winkimation 's generally thoughtful review ( " " Such a Shame " " ) that " " for once we actually see men 's faces when they come . " " A few years ago I did occasional freelance reviews for an adult mag and I recall seeing plenty of men 's faces when they came . I think this is probably more common when the film features on of the few male porn " " stars " " ( and especially when that male is the director ) . Though I unsurprisingly can 't refer to any specific titles , I know that there are some instances in Ron Jeremy 's , uh , work . I also don 't know that I 'd agree that a man is necessarily showing vulnerability in his face when coming . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a very odd film ... I wasn 't really sure what is was about , some N London lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all , in their own way , change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster . The film ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied , almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all . I didn 't care about any of the characters - none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer.What was the message ? Am I being dim ? It was just too odd . What happens to Runner ? Why does Emilio shoot the kid ? ... that made absolutely no sense , pointless . Can someone help me understand this mess of a film ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A pointless cash-in with nothing to contribute except nastiness , this is a definite case of sloppy seconds for Robocop . Irvin Kershner 's numbing , plot less and tired mess of a sequel is watchable and even mildly entertaining in a dubious , unpleasantly trashy way , but it has virtually none of the original 's flair , emotion , intelligence or excitement . Instead we have just another empty spectacle of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be to nauseate the viewer with relentless violence , which is far more brainlessly gratuitous than anything in the original . Omni Consumer Products , who made the original Robocop cyborg , have turned into more of a totalitarian force than ever second time round , what with the suspicious Nazi-esquire banners , stormtrooper guards and tanks for hire at the end ; as for the anonymous Old Man ( Daniel O ' Herlihy ) , he 's less of a benevolent protector and more of a hideous Mr. Burns type , surrounding himself with moronic lackeys who genuinely believe that putting the brain of a murderous psychopath into the body of the all-new Robocop 2 is a good idea . Oh , and the first Robocop gets a look in somewhere amidst all of this mess , though you wonder what on Earth a fine actor like Peter Weller saw in the script . The droll Tom Noonan has nothing to work with as the villain , while Nancy Allen is badly wasted as Robocop 's partner . There are some hilarious moments throughout ; the opening ' Magnavolt ' commercial , for instance , but this is a poor follow-up to the truly great original . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A good cast and they do their best with what they 're given , but the story makes no sense , the characters ' actions are inexplicable , and there are too many moments of unintentional humor , as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off . The scene when the two witch and her victim ( played by the same actress ) are in the house together sets up like a 3 Stooges routine , and the plot begs the question : if the witch wants to possess this other woman 's soul , why doesn 't she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase ? Not to be missed is Christopher Walkin 's eyeglasses and his automotive explanation of the afterlife ( paraphrased ) : " " The ancient Egyptianas - they wee materialists . They expected the body to last through eternity , like a used car that you souped up . But the Druids , they knew you couldn 't drive in the afterlife . You had to get out and walk . " " Huh ? The ending is absolutely indecipherable . Seems like they just ran out of film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is the kind of movie you regret you put in your VCR . It is some weird bad rip off version of Stephen kings movie " " Misery ( 1990 ) " . " I cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score , because it has no story what so ever , and when the movie finally ended , I was relieved.This movie should have been released as a short-movie instead .. to much time is spent on the same thing . And as in every bad movie , everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span ... So , before you decide to watch this movie , be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control , because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding ... don 't worry , you wont miss anything important . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" For starters , " " Hobgoblins " " tries to ape the more successful " " Gremlins " . " That 's bad enough but they don 't even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here . Instead , it 's more like a bargain basement , everything-must-go clearance of embarrassing scenes , inappropriate sound FX , acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws ' em down the old tube-aroo.The plot ? Grrrr .... Meddling kids track down gremlin-like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies . Sound cool , does it ? Well , see that wall on the other side of your room ? Run right at it , top speed , face first . See , THAT is cooler than this movie.You dare to doubt ? Quick , name something else one of the leads has been in other than this . What other scripts have the writers done since " " Hobgoblins " " ? Name another Rick Sloane directoral effort . How many " " Hobgoblins " " action figures do you have ? See ? THANK you.I cannot believe I took so long to write about such a horrible film . I 'd rather write about more important things ; like the separation of church and state , economic restructuring in Europe , that kind of thing . But no , " " Hobgoblins " " it is and it is bad - bad like your grandparents ' wallpaper , bad as pink flamingos on your lawn , bad like underwear that says " " Home of the Whopper " ... " and I think we 'll stop there.Well , Mike and the robots fight valiantly but try as they might , they can do only so much with " " Hobgoblins " " before they realize that , yes , the director DOES need kicked in the shin.Real , real hard.One star for " " Hobgoblins " , " seven stars for the MST3K version . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I can 't spoil it for anyone cos I can barely remember it ! ! To think , looking at the cast , it seemed a winner , with John Landis directing , but good god , they must have been paid a whole lot for this drivel ! !

" I am a huge Shirley Temple fan . When I saw this movie , it made me appreciate what a talented child Shirley actually was . Ashley Rose Orr made possibly the worst on-screen Shirley . Imagine an 11 year old playing Shirley Temple from the age of 5 . That in itself is wrong . But getting her to ' mimick ' Shirley 's voice ? And her singing is woeful . The dancing was good , I 'll say that . As previous users have said , there was little dramatic scenes , nothing to make the story interesting . Not even Amelia Earhart ... I would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that Shirley Temple created . There was too much focus on the Wizard of Oz , when in reality , Shirley was just considered for Dorothy . The film portrays it as though it is the end of the world when she does not get the role . Shirley herself said that she is glad Judy Garland got to play her . For me the star of the show was the lady who played Gertrude Temple . Otherwise , stay away ! For great Shirley Temple films , watch Heidi , Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous , over the top , entertaining bloodbath . I got none of them . This film fails on practically every level , not in the least frightening , or funny , it is simply terrible film-making , and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing . What is so bad about it is that far from being as raw , violent and brutal as it had promised to be , there is very little violence at all . Virtually no blood shed , and no excitement whatsoever . Acting , direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable . Honestly , it is truly laughable . I could hardly sit through this total garbage once ; I certainly will never want to watch it again . Don 't waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this ; it is truly possibly the worst film ever made . If I could give it minus stars , I would . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A holiday on a boat , a married couple , an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning.I like boobs . No question about that . But when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment , mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim , my anger just rises to a whole new level . Take two guys ( a husband and another man ) , put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them , ad a deserted island , subtract all her moral issues , ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments , fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this . The acting is , I would say , good . There are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see . The main female character makes me sick . This is due to her lack of moral values . The man with the most fish get 's her attention . Even though one of them is her husband , she sees no problem with being unfaithful with ( Manuel ) the other man because " " I must do it to survive " . " How can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30feet away ? And he won 't even benefit from it ? The female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does . If she doesen 't get approval for her actions , she 's a victim.I recommend everyone to see this movie .

" this movie is similar to Darkness Falls , and The Boogeyman ( 2005 ) but it 's also much more graphic than both , and not as good as either.it 's also slow and fairly predictable.it 's also got shades of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror.plus , we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational / inspirational sermon.really , this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything.even though it is gory , the makeup effects are not very realistic looking.in fact they look kinda cheap.aside from all that , there is some really awful clich챕d dialogue.and i won 't say when , but there is a point where a couple of the character 's actions were not authentic or believable , given the circumstances.nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way.once you watch the movie , you 'll know what i mean.there 's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity 's sake.it just wasn 't necessary at all.the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good.better than this movie deserves.so , after carefully weighing the evidence , id say this movie was passable , but not good.my verdict for The Tooth fairy : 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The only good thing about it was Cillian Murphy . He 's always good / believable and is severely under looked in many films . This , however , was just not good enough for him.Apart from the unlikable characters , boring storyline , the plot was also emotionally unsatisfying .

" This a fascinatingly awful movie . It make so little sense that it starts to make a kind of weird internal logic of its own . Well , it would if it didn 't keep darting off up side-alleys until eventually floundering under the weight of its own indecisiveness . The movie can 't make up its mind whether it is a straight forward ' Man Turns Into Monster ' flick ( like all those 1950s ' THE INCREDIBLE insert verb ING MAN ' movies ) , or a ghastly big business conspiracy theory movie , or a mystical afterlife contact story , or ... or what ?

" Consider for a moment what it must be like to be Uwe Boll . Somewhere , perhaps in those places that Jack Nicholson said ' you don 't talk about at parties ' , Boll knows that David Lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him . Gore Whores , metal-heads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the Teutonic helmsman 's output so bereft of originality , wit or imagination that he 's become the internet 's bogeyman 혯 an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement . Boll does his best to ride over these naysayers , exploiting tax credits available in Germany and Canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as Zero Mostel did with old ladies in The Producers . The difference being that Mostel 's character knew he was making bowel fill . Maybe Uwe knows it too.Such is the level of hostility toward each new ' Bollbuster ' that IMDb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before they 've seen it . Boll 's attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined . Indeed he 's probably the only filmmaker that 's boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage.This onslaught has made Uwe a very thick skinned man , so much so that he must feel like he 's wrapped in a carpet , but one who feels as if he 's bullied by the entire world . Like most people in that situation he lashes out , determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding Variety 's review of House of the Dead , never too far from the surface . This ' I know you are but what am I ' strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of Postal , which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 9 / 11 , Christian fundamentalism , Jihad , Nazism and paedophilia . Such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of Peter Cook and the visual imagination of Chris Morris but the closest Boll gets to either man is the o in their surname.In Seed , shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation , Boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer ( is there any other kind ? ) who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life . Mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free , though if you 'd been fried with that much electricity why would you want to , they pronounce him legally dead and bury him , only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolers.Boll begins his ' exploration of nihilistic rage ' with Seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes . From there we 're treated to the killer 's stock in trade 혯 kidnapping dogs , babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food . We 're invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are 혯 our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition . Yes , we 're worthless , gormless sadists and worse than that , we won 't give Uwe a good rating on the IMDb . In short , humanity is bunk.Of course you might think that Uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind it 's a bit of a bipolar piece , on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness 혯 the milk that poor old Boll has had to drink for so long , while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girth.The result says nothing about society and its discontents , more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director . Poor Uwe is obviously a very angry man 혯 one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair , no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasy 's about dispatching various web critics . That it 's there but takes an avant-garde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread , shows that Boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements . He 's made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate . " " I wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun " " Boll told the audience at the film 's world premiere and he has , on that flimsy manifesto , succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director 's detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker , he 'll need something genuine to say as well as a better , more original way of saying it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just finished reading a book on Anita Loos ' work and the photo in TCM Magazine of MacDonald in her angel costume looked great ( impressive wings ) , so I thought I 'd watch this movie . I 'd never heard of the film before , so I had no preconceived notions about it whatsoever . Thought it got off to a cute start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he doesn 't know exists . The scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that won 't stay on was really endearing . I was even with the film when Eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel . But after a while it just started to fall apart for me . Eddy stays " " asleep " " for the entire rest of movie , so it 's all a dream . Whatever happens from there on doesn 't really matter , because he 's just dreaming . The rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless . I had to force myself to stick with it . And the final number where MacDonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad hallucination was just plain freaky.Had Eddy " " woken " " a sooner and the original story continued , or had he really married an angel , I think it would have been a lot more interesting . I wanted to see more of her real character.There weren 't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical . The first few songs were good , but the jitterbug number that MacDonald performs was like nails on a chalkboard . Completely wrong for her operatic voice .

" Looking back on the year 2006 , one of the things i will remember most is the " " Snakeamania " " on the internet for a film called Snakes on a plane.But unknown to me there was a straight- to- DVD rip-off film called Snakes on a train ! After seeing this i feel its at best a below-par B-Movie.The plot : A husband and wife get on a train to go to Los Angles , to get help form the husbands uncle who is a shaman.This is because the wife 's family do not approve of her marring him , so they have put a curse on her that snakes will " " become her " .

View on the film : First the effects : I have to say that while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a gory-way , the main effect shots you have to wait eighty minutes to see ! Are sadly that bad that they completely kill any good memories of the film ( The film makes 198os Video Games look like T2 next to this ! . ) One of the things i noticed is that there is no screenplay credit on the film ! and the directors make the film so anti-climatic it ruins the whole film .

I will say that the acting by all the actors was superb . The sets were terrific and very realistic . I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised at how ' awful ' he looked . I hope he doesn 't look that way in ' real ' life ! I honestly can 't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same . Somehow I don 't think so .

To start , Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting .

" Having watched this movie on the SciFi channel , I can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives . The film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences , or " " delights " " as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me . The plot isn 't really worth commenting as , but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into Yeti territory . Before the movie is over , we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out , yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters , yetis ripping a man 's legs off and beating him with them , a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin , a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm , a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a man 's shoe , yet then jumps off , and a whole collection of further , bizarre occurrences . Basically , if you aren 't staying up on a Saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of SciFi channel original movies , avoid this film like the plague .

" The Return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time . Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout the movie . I was willing to put up with this , however I was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks . At the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young . Or maybe I 'm wrong and that was just a flashback . With this movie it 's impossible to tell . Can you believe the same dude who made Army of Darkness produced this crap ? A much better idea is to stay at home and watch Army of Darkness on Sci Fi channel . That movie had it all : sluts , zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for an arm . The Forgotten didn 't even have one of these things . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I grew up watching Inspector Gadget . It was , and still is , one of my favorite cartoons , if not my absolute favorite . I learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off Inspector Gadget 's Field Trip . I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever.But the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon.Matthew Broderick , an actor with potential , was definitely NOT the role for Inspector Gadget . First thing- in the film , Inspector Gadget is smart . Not so in the cartoon . In the film , Gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself . In the cartoon , it was almost always Penny , Brain , and the awesome book ( I still want her book ! ) . If Gadget solved the mystery , it was by accident . Gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective , but in the cartoon was pretty dumb , which was where the humor came from.Another thing is that it 's too much " " Good Guy v. Bad Guy " " in the film . It 's not just meant to be a silly Saturday morning cartoon . Also , Gadget never should have a love story , but Disney Corporation is filled with idiots.Also I miss the true gadgets that Gadget had , and especially the Gadget car . In the movie it was a chic convertible . In the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van . It also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place.But if anything , the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie . Inspector Gadget was a silly Saturday morning cartoon . The movie was too serious , too overdone , had too much of a plot and wasn 't even remotely as funny.Tip for those who haven 't seen it : NEVER see it . EVER . Watch the cartoon , it 's a true classic . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" How could 4 out of 16 prior voters give this movie a 10 ? How could more than half the prior voters give it a 7 or higher ? Who is voting here ? I can only assume it is primarily kids -- very young kids . The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way . The story is stupid ; the acting is hard to even think of as acting ; the characters are characterless ; and the dialogue is terrible . I saw this one rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel . In the sad event that it is ever rebroadcast , I suggest you read a book instead . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it 's still a way to make a living . However , after watching this movie , one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy , bloated , conceited , paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break . Not exactly a pretty picture , but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious , noisy , overacted action movie . Just what the doctor ordered ... right ? How many more of these movies has Hollywood made ? One thousand ? Two thousand ? The formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable . The locales change but the plots remain the same , and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly . This movie seemed to run-on interminably . " " When will this movie end ? " " I repeatedly thought to myself . Leonardo DiCaprio was totally unbelievable as a CIA operative , but what has to be one of the great gaffs of miscasting , an overweight Russell Crowe plays a CIA bureaucrat . Please note that in this movie the on site operative is " " lean and mean " " while his desk jockey supervisor is fat . This is called stereotyping . What was the casting director thinking ? Why not have Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk ? Or Nicole Kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman ? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility . An obviously non-Arab American ( Mr. DiCaprio ) trying to pass himself off as an Arab ... speaking fluent Arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real Arabs who are completely unfooled by his laughable Arab masquerade ... trying to romance a Palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc . By now you get the point . Next time try casting an actual Arab in the role . Not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that . There should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist . In this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles . Next stop for this movie - DVD land and oblivion . And one other thing . Don ; t let this movie discourage you from working for the government . The pay may not be great , but the fringe benefits are excellent , a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Many people see this as a classic , but I obviously must have missed something . Life in Anarene , Texas in the early 50 's is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in Anarene , Texas in the early 50 's will be pretty dull too ! What is it that so many people see in this ? Once the last picture show in Anarene closes there really won 't be anything to do in town . Duane ( Jeff Bridges ) makes that point at the end of the movie . But even before it closes there isn 't much to do , so basically everything revolves around sex . High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town . You see , there 's not much for them to do either - except to have sex ( sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers ) or to whine about the local high school football team . Three times something happened that I thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie . Sam ( Ben Johnson ) dies unexpectedly , but nothing really happens because of that , Sonny ( Timothy Bottoms ) and Jacy ( Cybill Shepherd ) elope , but nothing really happens because of that , Joe Bob ( Barc Doyle ) kidnaps a little girl , but nothing really happens because of that . The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of Billy ( Sam Bottoms ) which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town , as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast.Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white , which is intended I suppose to point out how grey this town is , but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Bottoms , Shepherd , Bridges and Randy Quaid . ( As an aside it was terrifying to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character of Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies . ) Classic ? I don 't think so ! 3 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" obviously has some talent attached , Maria Bello is always great. but this is just a dreary wast of time , portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an ' interesting ' story. well , i hope they got it out of their systems. unfortunately for the audience , there is no insight , no sensitivity , no context , and really no humanity. which would all be fine , except it has no humor , no horror , no context , and nothing constructive to say about the story it 's trying to tell. bad things happen , you sit and watch it , you don 't care , so what ? 99 % of the time , the words ' based on a true story ' constitute an unintentional warning to the audience. it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere , so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the ' true ' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work. i hope they had a great time making this movie. it stinks on ice . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Where do I begin ? I wanted to enjoy this movie , and I did . Still , I wanted to be able to enjoy it for being another zombie film that was worth my loot , and it wasnt . This was a different kind of enjoyment . This was unhealthy , a perverse glee that I partook in watching one of the most ridiculous films Id seen yet . And I dont much care for whatever Fulci 's excuses were , there was no excuse for this film going how it went . This was a bad film all the way around , yet I still cant give it below a 4 out of ten , which is what I gave it , because well ... at least I was able to laugh at this misfit of a movie.I had to imagine these zombies , that were all over the ceilings of these buildings everywhere ... had to imagine that they were either bored as hell so they crawled up on the beems , and perched themselves high on stone erections , or they saw the fleshy living motley band of jerk-offs coming around , so they took it upon themselves to stage numerous aerial ambushes . Hell , what else is there to do when youre dead ? I had to laugh at some zombies performing what looked to be martial arts swings , kicks , and jumps , and some shambling about like traditional meatlovers . I feasted my eyes on a floating head that was never explained . I watched in pure horrific delight as the land they were in , the Phillipenes , was absolutely engulfed in fog , heavy doses of fog , and that the ponds were as they were boiling castle moats . I had to even cringe when I saw that the design for a cure for this plague was sketched on a chalkboard as an octagon with lines stretching from each angle , with " " Dead One " " written in the middle . I had to ask myself ... if the science of curing zombies is that easy , then I wonder if I could come up with a little something to start a zombie outbreak here ! All in all the effects were overboard , the dubbing horrid , Im sure the original acting as poor , the story absurd , the zombies inconsistent , even in a bad way they couldve all been similar , and the women ugly , but I found myself enjoying this thing . It was a fun watch . It turned out to be a very very bad film , and I would not recommend this thing unless one is into bad directorial exploitation films , but still , again I say ... it was worth a good laugh . I crave zombie films no matter what , but when this had Fulci 's name attached to it , it shouldve been much better . Let me dare say , Zombie Holocaust was better . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" a romance without feeling , a drama of issues without point ( or drama ) .... This film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account , as if it isn 't trying . Or as if the director / editor / scriptwriter team isn 't really trying . The actors are able--they need better support.One element that doesn 't fail is the score by George Delarue . Beautiful and moving . What a shame it 's attached to this film . In a good film actors ' words and movements and music synchronize and enhance the impact . This editor plastered on music with no regard for dialogue and movement . The love scene is particularly grating in this respect : an insult to the talents of the lead actors.There is another element in the film that works : location photography . Notably one moment in Grand Central Station . I 'd guessed in advance what was going to happen ; but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking.Some commentators on this board have pointed out that US assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists actually happened during these years of the MacCarthy scare . The moment the film seems to start looking seriously at American society , it switches into conventional romance ; before any human feelings can move us , it 's away on a ( predictable ) ' thriller ' escapade.Just as the film insults the talents of the actors , it insults the issues it 's pretends ( and fails ) to take up.You are warned . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This is another typical unbelievable and non-sensical piece of Hollywood dreck.Kurt Russell , as Snake Pliskin in a business suit , convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman .

Kurt and Madeline then do their obligatory end-of-the-movie embrace , and EVERYBODY--- except Russell and Stowe , KNOWS Liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple again.He does , of course , and Russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm , which was ENTIRELY unnecessary .

OK when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group I was with . Now living in America especially during this election I see some very deceiving things but I have to say these previews were towards the top of list . I don 't see how so many people could be scared by this movie . I only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one . The whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me . As for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of I thought they were comical at best . Oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why ? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning . How does that scare someone ? I can make that noise easily .

" Can I please say first of all , that I felt so strongly about this movie that I signed up to IMDb specifically to review it . And my review ? This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.The synopsis of the movie sounded interesting- Nazis , occult , time travel , etc . , but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together . Remember the episode of South Park that featured manatees writing Family Guy using ' idea balls ' ? Did these manatees also write Unholy ? Its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas , but had no idea how to link them all together , and then to make things make even less sense , included a Donnie Darko-esquire time travel theme to the ending , messing up the chronology.I could tell from early on that this was a bad movie . Special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to DVD . The acting wasn 't great , but in fairness I 've seen worse . I will praise the Nazi paintings , they were creepy , but the evil Nazi butcher guy was just comic.I don 't have a vendetta against this movie or anything , but to be honest , I 'm not even into the horror genre . But this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama . If this story had been well told , this would have been a good movie . But it has been over hyped .

" I am ashamed of myself that I actually went to the theatre to watch this movie when it was first released . While I suppose its thinly veiled depiction of the Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy story is well enough done , it 's a movie that should never have been made in the first place ; hence , my low rating.The film chronicles the tale of a wealthy Greek business shark called Theo Tomasis , who woos and wins the lovely young widow , Liz Cassidy , of a slain American President . Sound familiar ? Yes , everything except the names.The cast is not to be faulted . Anthony Quinn plays the Greek tycoon to perfection , and at least it 's some consolation , having just read that Ari himself requested Quinn for the role . Jacqueline Bisset is of course beautiful and sophisticated in the part of ( for all intents and purposes ) Jackie , and James Franciscus has the all American good looks of the President.I haven 't seen this movie since it came out , nor do I wish to see it again . I seem to recall a fair bit of bad language and some general crudeness . Otherwise , I suppose it 's a sensational and supposedly intimate glimpse into the jet setting lives of the rich and famous , frolicking aboard their yachts , beaches , pools etc . Yes , the scenery of the Greek islands is spectacular , the best part of the movie.Of its type , it 's okay , I suppose . There are no end of TV movies about the Kennedys , which I confess to occasionally tuning in to , and not to my credit . This is basically just another . Far better to allow Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to rest in peace . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ben , ( Rupert Grint ) , is a deeply unhappy adolescent , the son of his unhappily married parents . His father , ( Nicholas Farrell ) , is a vicar and his mother , ( Laura Linney ) , is ... well , let 's just say she 's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus ' army . It 's only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul-mouthed , eccentric , once-famous and now-forgotten actress Evie Walton , ( Julie Walters ) , that he finally finds himself in true ' Harold and Maude ' fashion . Of course , Evie is deeply unhappy herself and it 's only when these two sad sacks find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness.Of course it 's corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it , too and Walters , who could sleep-walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted , is excellent . It 's when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character , ( like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink ) , that she 's at her best . The problem is she 's the only interesting character in the film ( and it 's not because of the script which doesn 't do anybody any favours ) . Grint , on the other hand , isn 't just unhappy ; he 's a bit of a bore as well while Linney 's starched bitch is completely one-dimensional . ( Still , she 's got the English accent off pat ) .

" This is probably the most uninvolving film I 've ever seen . I watched it because I have a soft spot for Leon ( everything else Besson has done has been just awful , in my opinion , with the exception of the script for Wasabi ) and Jean Reno . It 's a testament to just how bad this film is that Reno , one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable actors ( admittedly he 's just starting out here ) can 't make this film , or the moments in which he is on screen , watchable.It 's all very film-schooly : black and white , no dialogue , people doing things for no apparent reason , people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera . And , predictably , none of it is entertaining.It 's not a " " French Mad Max " " as some people have claimed ( actually , I think they mean " " Mad Max 2 " " ) - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting , and is just the kind of comment you 'd expect from someone who doesn 't know what they 're talking about . Mad Max 2 was pulsating , Mad Max 2 was exciting , Mad Max 2 was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of these.I know it 's supposed to be cool to like arty black-and-white French films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not ( or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy ) , which is why I wouldn 't trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat , because I see nothing of worth in it whatsoever ; it asks for so much and gives nothing back . I found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention .

" Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it 's intrigue , I most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers . Enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained " " your father died today " " comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters.This won first place at Cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering . Perhaps the French had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film . I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it 's over . I LOVED movies such as " " Trainspotting " " or " " Requiem for a Dream " " - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing . To watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that I found it tedious - and I really wanted to like this film at every turn . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Not a knock on Korman as he was very funny on the Carol Burnett show . He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks ' movies ( " " High Anxiety " " comes to mind ) . He is , however , not a person who can carry a movie in dueling roles no less . This one is basically a " " Gremlins " " knockoff , following a tradition of such movies as " " Critters " " and " " Ghoulies " . " It is not a very good knockoff either , on par with " " Ghoulies " , " but with a much lighter tone to it as it is no where near as dark as that movie got . In fact , this one is too light and frothy , and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat . Though I did give it a 3 for a score , this is only because there is a movie that is even a worse " " Gremlin " " knockoff . If you watched Mystery Science Theater 3000 you know the one I am talking about ... the infamous " " Hobgoblins " . " This one has a guy finding a little critter in some underground place ( I only saw this movie once a long time ago so I don 't remember everything to clearly ) and it starts out friendly enough . However , this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and of course more are spawned and that is the movie . More misses than hits in the joke department , and it is also really lame to see Korman playing the evil brother role .

The only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver . The rest of the film , could have easily been made by middle school children .

" " " A Damsel in Distress " " is definitely not one of Fred Astaire 's better musicals . But even Astaire 's bad films always had some good moments.In " " Damsel , " " Astaire is Jerry Halliday , an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour . He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton ( 19-year-old Joan Fontaine ) , a beautiful English heiress , who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt . He tries to rescue her from her family 's country manor house , but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry . Keggs ( Reginald Gardiner ) the conniving butler , and Albert ( Harry Watson ) , the bratty house boy , each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice 's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet.This musical has numerous problems . First , there is the plot , based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse ( who co-wrote the screenplay ) . The story is slow , painful , and nerve-grating . When Fred is not dancing , we have to endure endless annoying scenes of ( a ) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or ( b ) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other.The butler and the house boy are especially irritating . They are one-dimensional stock villain characters , the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth . You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance.Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner , Ginger Rogers . Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film , and is miscast in a musical . She has little going for her , character-wise , other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride , as Jerry 's publicist and his ditzy secretary . The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot , and Gracie has some funny lines , but she is also very annoying at times.The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done . At times , the cinematography is horrible and off-focus . There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets , to try to convince the audience that we are in London , not Hollywood . ( They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie . ) On the plus side , the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific , and have become classic song standards . And of course , the dancing in the movie is exceptional , thanks to Astaire and his choreographer , Hermes Pan.But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged . At times , the cast seems to start singing and dancing because , well , it 's time for them to start singing and dancing . The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot . ( At one point , the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason . ) The numbers include : ? ? " " I 'm Dancing and I Can 't Be Bothered Now " " -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street . He does some great " " cane-twirling " " with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus . ( In the Broadway musical , " " Crazy For You , " " Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls . ) ? ? " " Put Me To The Test " " -- Fred , George , and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage . George and Gracie match Fred step for step , but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason . ? ? " " Stiff Upper Lip " " ( The Fun House Number ) -- At an amusement park fun house , Fred , George , and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor , rotating barrel , and with the fun house mirrors . It 's the best number of the movie , but it gets a little repetitious at times . ? ? " " Things Are Looking Up " " -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film , prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate . Fortunately , it 's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer . ? ? " " A Foggy Day in London Town " " -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night , crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London . At times , he looks as if he 's not sure which way he 's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself . ? ? " " Nice Work If You Can Get It " " -- A great song that is misused in the movie . During a social event at the manor house , Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song . Each time Fred joins in , the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave . ( Again , Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in " " Crazy For You . " " ) ? ? " " Drum Dance Number " " -- As Fred and Joan are eloping , Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums . As usual , it 's a great dance number . But there 's absolutely no need for it , except to prolong the movie.The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine . As he leaps from the balcony , he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that 's right , a * trapeze * -- hanging from a nearby tree . Fred ( or rather , a stuntman in Fred 's clothes ) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone , but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote . The > > FF button allows you to skip through the other , boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Is Miike like Chabrol , alternating art with dreck , sometimes confusing the two ? Does he match the fifty / fifty rate some claim for Chabrol ? Do we see here too much or too little Miike ?

Call this movie by another title , but don 't call it Caddyshack 2 . You give that great movie a bad name . Jackie Mason 's daughter when I first saw her looked like his wife . How old is this girl ? Geez . How about making this movie a little believable . I thought Chevy Chase was good . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Margaret Mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess ! Fine costuming and sets can 't even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by Joanne Whalley ( as the title character ) and the ever-bland Timothy Dalton ( as Rhett ) . Even worse than the acting--and perhaps partially explaining it--is the script , which is astoundingly cliched and predictable . Add to that hellishly bad script a score that 'll have you cringing , and you 've got a disaster I wouldn 't wish on any viewer . SCARLETT is just amazingly lousy , and I can 't imagine how it ever got made , much less made it to video . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Whoever has the movie watches it , and then passes it to someone else deemed worthy of seeing this unique , creative , horrible movie . Hopefully it 'll travel ' round the world a few times.It 's painful . Really painful . It 's even beyond so bad it 's funny . Well , okay , sometimes it 's so bad it 's funny . But most of the time it just gives you that feeling that there 's something sucking at your brain from the inside.Wow. Watch it , then pass it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" An American boy goes to Paris after his mother commits suicide , becomes and artist and then discovers himself and returns to the States so he can make things right with his former friends.I have to think that the people who are rating this movie so highly are all X-Files fans , even though there are no aliens or serial killers in it . Don 't be fooled , this movie blows chunks.The story is incoherent , with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why . When you do get an explanation , it doesn 't fit the story that went before it . What it does is bore you . For all the acting talent in the film , it just isn 't interesting . I spent the whole movie wondering when sex-addict Duchovny was going to bang someone . Maybe he was doing it behind the scenes ; they should have filmed that instead.What comes across is a story of a self-obsessed artist worrying about minor incidents in his life and wanting to make them right somehow - even though they didn 't seem that wrong to begin with . There aren 't any particularly interesting or shocking revelations , despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minutes . It 's just a guy thinking that his life is as interesting to you as it is to him . It 's not.I saw in the trivia that Duchovny claims he wrote the script in a week , that 's entirely believable . The guy can act , there 's no doubt , but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talents.Why Hollywood keeps greenlighting these self-discovery stories is beyond me . I discover myself in the shower every morning but I don 't bother making a movie about it . Mine would probably be better than this one , though ; at least there would be some nudity . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There is nothing like an Oscar Wilde comedy , and this movie is nothing like a comedy . The melodrama labors from scene to scene and the comedy is completely absent .

He ALWAYS solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is . No co star ever gets the glory . Its all Norris .

" What is it with Americans and their hang-up with religious gobbledy-gook ? To think this was a best-selling novel is incredible , but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers . In this case , all the good actors have gone to heaven and we 're left with Kirk Cameron as a CNN-type journalist ( ! ) trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared . Oh yeah , there 's a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine , or something . The good news is that this is done so cheaply , and with such inane dialogue , that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its unintended laughs .

" Just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the Michigan Bar Exam . I wanted something that was mindless and that I could just sit back and say , " " what the hell were they thinking ? " " I was not disappointed in this undertaking , but had I been watching this one in a serious mood , I would have been irate . The company that made this thing just spliced CGI footage from the first Octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in " " Bride of the Monster " " look like a masterpiece of special effect footage . Since when does an octopus have fangs ? The plot is that an NYPD diver is investigating some murders / disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before the Fourth of July . He and his partner ( who is soon to be transferred , or soon to be munched on by a fig bucking octopus ) investigate in a rather inept manner ( all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people ) and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the Mayor 's office . Of course on one believes that an octopus can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the mayor 's office . Surprisingly , all hell doesn 't break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killed.Really lame . Don 't bother with it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OK enough already. this is a terrible piece of television. the camera work is appalling ( do i have to remind you of the crunchy gravel so loud you can hardly hear the actors speak ) lady bertram has the most annoying voice in the entire world. anna massey is ' acting ' in such an unbelievable fashion. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is beyond beyond. also the bertram girls aren 't pretty enough , and the guy playing henry crawford is awful. to say the camera work is dodgy is an understatement. i watched this adaptation over Christmas , and i think under any other circumstances i would not have been able to endure this , and certainly would have not been able to justify the wasted time.i am a fan of faithful to jane adaptations. so i could not bear the film adaptation or the recent pride and prejudice movie. but see any other adaptation instead , even emma is better than this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Me being from Australia and loving the series , I wasn 't expecting much from the American version of Kath and Kim but I thought I 'd watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad.Well , whats there to say . Its nothing special.Selma Blair is OK as Kim and actually had a few good lines , Molly Shannon is not a good Kath though . The good thing about Jane Turner 's Kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accents ( such as when she says Yumor or Noice ) it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks , but when Shannon has a go at the accent , its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as Turner . And the show really misses Sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about , because the Kal and Craig characters in this version are really not funny.So far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the Aussie version , although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name , not being compared to the Aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better . But if there is nothing else to do on a Sunday night ( or Thursday night in America ) then you cant do much harm in watching it , or better put on some of the Aussie version if you 've got it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Possibly the worst film within the genre in existence . It was announced as a comedy , but is simply tragically pathetic . I don 't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to . It is toilet humour at its very poorest , I would avoid even watching the trailer . I only went to see it because it was announced that if you like Monty Python , you are bound to love this . Whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged . I am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement . Rarely do I leave the cinema , really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me : this one did it in just 30 minutes . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Awful ! Despite the good performance of Ed Harris , Diane Kruger , and the strong budget ( the reason for the 3 stars ) , the movie is by far the worst I saw about a composer , and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music . I agree with some fictional stuff to upgrade a biography , that otherwise couldn 't be so " " charming " . " This was done in AMADEUS with best results , but this B copy here is a flaw . Beethoven had a strong personality , but was a sensible artist . Here in this movie however , he looks much more as Mike Tyson ! I wonder also , whether despite his deafness , he heard all the whisperings in the last scenes ( may be a cochlear implant ? ) . I prefer to listen to the ninth on a CD with some nice maestro . Today most of them conduct modern Wagnerian orchestras . By the way : I gave Amadeus 10 / 10 ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Like another reviewer , I really wanted to like this movie . I went with my father who was the biggest lover and booster of classical music but neither of us could stand this movie . I wouldn 't even call it a movie . A better description might be a record of a few chamber concert pieces . As I recall , the camera never even moved . Rather , I just sat on a tripod for the entirety of each piece . The only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end of each piece when the movie would cut to trees waving in the wind or little wavelets lapping at a beach . I 'm sure the director would have preferred to have used footage of some really big crashing waves but the best he could find were a few inches high at some nearby lake , and again using a stationary camera . Truly pathetic . I can 't imagine how anyone could justify rating this movie higher than a five . When we walked out , my father and I were completely mystified as to how it was possible to make such a bad movie . I don 't know of of any good movies about Bach . The world really does need one , but just because it doesn 't exist is not a reason to see this one . Someone will make one someday . Until then just keep rewatching _ Amadeus _ . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I think we all begin a lot of reviews with , " " This could 've made a GREAT movie . " " A demented ex-con freshly sprung , a tidy suburban family his target . Revenge , retribution , manipulation . Marty 's usual laying on of the Karo syrup . But unfortunately somewhere in Universal 's high-rise a memorandum came down : everyone ham it up.Nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised , Lange bitches her way through cigarettes , Lewis " " Ohmagod 's ! " " her way though her scenes , and Bobby D ... well , he 's on a whole other magic carpet . Affecting some sort of Cajun / Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid , he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as " " Problem Child " . " And I want you to imagine the accent mentioned above . Now imagine it spouting brain-clanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles , and you have De Niro 's schtick here . Most distracting of all , though , is his most OVERDONE use of the " " De Niro face " " he 's so lampooned for . Eyes squinting , forehead crinkled , lips curled . Crimany , Bob , you looked like Plastic Man.The story apparently began off-screen 14 years earlier , when Nolte was unable to spare De Niro time in the bighouse for various assaults . Upon release , he feels Nolte 's misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin . And we 're supposed to give De Niro 's character a slight pass because Nolte withheld information that might 've shortened his sentence . De Niro being one of these criminals who , despite being guilty of unspeakable acts , feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside . Mmm-kay.He goes after Notle 's near-mistress ( in a scene some may want to turn away from ) , his wife , his daughter , the family dog , ya know . Which is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick 's screenplay : utter predictability . As each of De Niro 's harassments becomes more gruesome , you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens . Strick isn 't to be totally discredited , as he manages a few compelling dialogue-driven moments ( De Niro and Lewis ' seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film 's best scene ) , but mostly it 's all over-cranked . Scorsese 's cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced , not to mention the HORRIBLY outdated re-worked Bernard Hermann score ( I kept waiting for the Wolf Man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula ) .Thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick . Unintentionally comedic , that is . You know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening , but you can 't help but snicker out of sight of others ? You 'll do it here . Nolte and Lange squawking about infidelity , De Niro 's thumb-flirting , he cross-dressing , and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed . And Bob 's infernal , incessant , CONSTANT , mind-damaging , no-end-in sight blowhard ramblings of all the " " philosophy " " he disovered in prison . I wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family.I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers , but here it 's necessary . This really * is * Scorsese 's version of Freddy Krueger . The manner in which De Niro relishes , speaks , stalks , withstands pain , right down to his one-liners , is vintage Freddy . Upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water : " " You trying ' to offer sumpin ' hot ? " " Please . And that 's just one example.Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing Balsam , Peck , and Mitchum nearly 30 years later ( or want a serious head-shaking film experience ) , avoid a trip to the Cape . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I could barely make it through one viewing , THAT 'S how hideous she is in this.Cary ? Gorgeous and in fine dramatic form . Jayne ? Adorable , endearing , and obviously having a ball . The supporting cast does alright , and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning , retro elegance.Then you see Suzy Parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness , a deadness , a cluelessness that simply defies belief .

" Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany . Brando 's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable . The plot is inane and laughable ( not comic ) . The other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity ... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard . Everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful . The director throws freeze-frame and slow-motion shots about with impunity . The incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect . It 's not something I really look for in a movie , but even the wardrobe was way off . The venerable Brando couldn 't take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in . I 've heard this movie called " " David Lynch-esquire " " and " " irreverently funny " ... " it is neither . David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film was in no way creative . And don 't confuse irreverence with stupidity . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director , but he has made some undeniably important films . Kids , Bully , and to a lesser extent Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose : shock , revulsion , and even disgust . These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth . Kids exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young . Bully touched upon similar issues . Ken Park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui . Irrefutably , all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth.Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Hispanic skateboarders from South-Central Las Angeles who go to arbitrarily go to Beverly Hills to skate . That 's it.Wassup Rockers is nothing.It has no substance . It has an essentially nonexistent narrative . And , like Kids , it features a cast of first-time actors who were drawn out of the films setting . However , unlike Kids , none of them have any semblance of talent . There is better acting in porn . This film features , without a doubt , the most terrible performances I 've ever seen in a feature film . One can respect Larry Clark to exposing these young men to the film-making process , but these kids are absolutely cringe-worthy , folks . Might I add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack , which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk you 'll ever hear- my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater , or you 'll regret it afterward.But then again , it 's not like they had much of a script to work with . Every line that is uttered is a contrived , pathetically-delivered , and irritating beyond all measure . The story itself is ludicrous . It starts out reasonably enough , but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity . This begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls , followed by a series of clich챕d National Lampoonish encounters , characters being killed off for no reason , and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti-climax . Shots go on much longer than they need to . Be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight , overlong , lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets . But then again , with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible . Perhaps Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film.Anyways , I could go on like this . This is the worst film Larry Clark has made yet . For those of you who are interested in seeing a Clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics , look elsewhere . This is by far the tamest film he 's made yet , and it 's also the worst . It 's flat out horrible . Like , Uwe Boll horrible . Definitely the worst one I saw at the festival.1 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First time I ever felt I needed to write a review.I have seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a wide range of movies . I am reasonably opened minded , and can easily say I enjoyed a movie while still saying " " yeah it was not good but I enjoyed it " . " I can appreciate the mastery of great movies like The Shaw shank redemption , the godfather , and American history X. I can like good movies in a genre like horror , or comedy , even if the movie might not be that great . I can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me ( Bloodsport ) . I also will try to rate movie fairly even if I did not like it . City lights by Charlie Chapin was not a movie I enjoyed , but I can appreciate the acting and story lines for the time.I think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly click a rating , should take a few ideas into account . Try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was . Do not let your personal bias affect the rating . Also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to rate.This " " movie " " was the worst piece of trash I have ever seen . 2 hours of my life where just stolen . The acting was awful , across the board . The scenes where choppy at best . However the real disgrace was the story . The first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to B. However after that it was a nightmare . They kept trying to add new elements but nothing was every explained . Nothing really ever made sense , was steward dead , is he alive , did he hit by lighting , was it really lighting , was it aliens , is he an alien , etc . The ending tied nothing together and really did not answer any questions . The only positive was nobody cared we where just happy to leave the theater.6.5 / 10 ? ? ? What is wrong with some of you ? I will admit that the 8 of us where so mad about seeing this , we did think " " what would make it better ? " , " and we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie . What can I say misery loves company . That is really the only reason I can see for a 6.5 rating.Do not waste your life ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Formulaic to the max . Neither title reflects the serial 's actual content , " " Fighting Nazis in Morocco , " " ( actually , the Iverson ranch ) . The plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights . The packaging claims over 40 ' fistic encounters ' in 15 chapters . That 's at least three a chapter ! Aside from seeing Duncan Renaldo cast as a Spanish accented Frenchman , watching how much furniture is overturned , smashed , thrown , burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about . When the protagonists start fighting , you can bet that everything in the room will be in it , too . So , kudos to the fight choreographer , who is the real star of this serial ! Two positive notes : the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights , and best of all , we have the girl side kick ( often a journalist , as she is here ) actually participating in the mayhem , mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys . Yet to come is Linda Stirling killing the main villain in " " Manhunt of Mystery Island " " ( 1945 ) . On the negative side , there are just too many jump out of the way escapes-- before the slab falls , before the car goes over the cliff , before the speedboat explodes , before the building explodes , before the truck hits you , etc. etc.It is claimed that this serial partially ' inspired ' George Lucas to make the first Indiana Jones film , but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the serial 's development.Rod Cameron ' shines ' as a moving rock , a role he played in all his films . Other than watching all the furniture getting smashed , there 's nothing really going on here , compared to other serials that have fewer fights , more story , better actors and more developed characters.I give it a 3 for all the furniture smashing . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film 's basic premise is a political cartoon . I suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a " " feel-good " " film on gender equality . Indeed a recent commentator stated : " " it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do . " " What claptrap ! No one , man or woman can do anything they want to do , and unfortunately Demi Moore " " buffing " " up for SEAL Hell Week in the early 27 week BUD / S program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a SEAL is simply not going to make it so . There is approximately an 80 % dropout rate in what is arguably THE roughest military training program - those are the ones who voluntarily drop out , can 't compete on a physical level , suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can 't handle the psychological harassment . I never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived , purported message of this film . In the real world , Demi wouldn 't last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training . Wishing alone won 't do it . Skip this film as wishful thinking , and better spend your time reading " " The Warrior Elite " " by Dick Couch ( Crown , New York 2001 ) for the best description as to what really goes on in this training . Ring the bell , Demi ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yeah , I " " get " " Pasolini and his milieu , but at the same time , I feel his " " Decameron " " is largely overrated , and more than a little disturbing . Overrated because the supposed " " realism " " he introduces ( milling crowds , crumbling architecture , etc . ) are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave . In the pursuit of realism , Pasolini utilized many non-actors , but their deer-in-the-headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off-kilter and inconsistent feel . And frankly -- many of the toothless , misshapenly-featured people are painful to look at.And Pasolini 's " " Decameron " " is disturbing ( to me at least ) because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content . Not because I 'm prudish or homophobic ( I 'm neither ) but because the emphasis that Pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo-realism he otherwise espouses , so it comes off as gratuitous and forced . One can almost hear him say " " Ooh--I 've got to stick a cute , naked boy in this scene ! " " At times it seems that Pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics , and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself , regardless of what his audience might prefer.The disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolini 's " " Decameron " " struck me as being a failing of Pasolini as a storyteller , rather than being an aspect of neo-realism . He seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction . Even the Pasolini 's final line of dialog in the film , which some people seem to find pithy ( " " Why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter ? " " ) -- to me , it just makes me wonder why Pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way ? In my opinion , a far better-crafted film ( and with MORE homosexual content ) is Fellini 's " " Satyricon " . " It is also full of bizarre-looking people and absurd situations , but it succeeds because of its pacing , direction and strong storytelling whereas " " Decameron " " fails by those same elements . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels . Ironically , I did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action.The cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters , focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter .

" This is a classic stinker with a big named cast , mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this one.This is quite a depressing film when you think about it . Remain on earth , and you will face illness and eventually your demise.Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance . Too bad the movie didn 't concentrate more on that . Maureen Stapleton , looking haggard , still displayed those steps from " " Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom , " " so much more down to earth from 10 years earlier.I only hope that this film doesn 't encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of Jim Jones . How can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to think ? Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense ? If the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end , why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat ? Why did Steve Guttenberg jump ship as well ? After all , he had found his lady-love . This would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there.Sadly , with the exception of Wilford Brimley , at this writing , Vernon , Gilford , Stapleton , Ameche , Tandy , Cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone .

The first two seasons were golden , and if I was exclusively talking about those seasons , this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars . None of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are any good . They were , and are , awful . The comedy is not funny at all . AT ALL ! ! ! The original cast was full of very talented comedians , like Artie Lange , Phil LaMarr , and Mary Schorr ( or whatever her name is ) , all of whom should have gotten better deals after they left MAD TV .

" Though some would prefer to comment on the value of Bond movies in the connection of learning frequency , and while most of the jargon that tends to limit Bond to a meager 007 following has been exploited beyond all reasonable contention , there are several redeeming plausibilities that extend the credibility of Sean Connery in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance by Jessica Tandy in Driving Miss Daisy . While Connery had been less visible in the latter , his woman-seeker qualities had maybe not cast a frown on the face of embittered spectators as it would in this latest rendition which , to most involved , approached the 007 theme with kind resentment , albeit while the general flavor had been altered . Great for those who interest others while faking to be who you 're not ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I saw Alien vs. Predator a few years ago , I have to say as stupid as a sequel it was , it was still somewhat enjoyable . Now , there are unfortunately a shortage of good movies out in the theater lately , so my boyfriend and I decided to just go ahead and see what AVPR : Aliens vs Predator - Requiem was about . So we saw it a couple nights ago and I have to say that there was absolutely nothing thrilling about this horror sequel . It took a completely different turn from the first AVP movie , it 's not a bad idea that they took Alien and Predator and put them in the up class suburbs , but from the idea of the first one explaining their reasons for existing , this was just an average and predictable horror sequel . Not to mention a story that keeps introducing new characters every scene where I wasn 't sure who to keep in mind on who was the main character and why , so I couldn 't really keep up with the story.From what I 've gathered , of course the Predator and the Alien are up in space having to deal with the stuff of typical sit com neighbors , they 're just beating the lights out of each other and they decide to why not ? Go ahead and take it out on some Earthlings . So they crash and Alien is taking over the suburbia utopia . But teenagers , including a troubled couple who look like Ken and Barbie , a female marine and her daughter , among others , are going to make sure to kick some space butt , that is if the predator doesn 't get there first . Because he is ticked off at the Alien , I guess for starting the party without him , lol , just kidding , actually for killing some of his friends.AVPR : Aliens vs Predator - Requiem isn 't the worst movie by any standards , it 's still pretty cool with a lot of the visual effects and the fight sequences between Alien and Predator are so cool to watch . Like the first sequel of Alien vs. Predator , the cast is the thing that ruins the film and just seems like they were not well developed , I know it 's horror , but the original Alien and Predator films had characters , that you cared about and wanted to win . But it was a semi-decent sequel that I would say is worth a look for some fun , especially for Ken and Barbie 's sake.4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As interesting as a sheet of cardboard , this dispensable period piece has little going for it .

" Assassin Hauser 's ( John Cusak ) mission is to whack a Mid-Eastern oil minister , whose name happens to be Omar Sharif ( Neikov ) , in the country of Turaqistan which is run by American interests . Hauser poses as Trade Show producer to allow him to get to Omar.Sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying . Here it does too much : the government , politics , music , war , people not generally accepted by society , and did I mention " " war . " " And , that is what we have here - a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life . I am still asking myself why I continued with the DVD . Also , there are so many Cusak family members in this that John Cusak appears embarrassed by the family just being there , or is that just me ? It used to be that a John Cusak movie , while a little offbeat , was , in the end , rather good . Not here . Believe that John Cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess . Make of that what you will.There is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun-fire , bombings , and shouting that you really cannot focus or was that the point ? Probably . It just takes too long to set up the hit , which is largely forgotten until the last 15-minutes . In the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast . And , chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei ? I don 't think so , but you know : the boy 혯 girl thing 혚혚and they needed something to take up more time . Yes , for what they were supposed to be , ( offbeat and annoying ) the performances of Duff , and Kingsley were good . But , when I saw Dan Aykroyd 's character , in the beginning of the show , sitting on a toilet taking a dump , I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well . I was not wrong . I am sure some will sing praises of this effort , but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so , too , is a mess혚혚혚혚혚I now remember why I continued with the DVD .

" I see quite a few positive reviews on this board , trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following . I see the usual ranting-- " " I guess this movie is just not for the easily offended , " " " " This movie is not Shakespeare , " " etc . Guess what ? Neither was " " Road Trip " " ! And I laughed my a * * off during that movie ! There 's a way to make a crude , tasteless comedy and deliver laughs ; and there 's a way to ... just make it crude and tasteless . " " Whipped " " tries to be " " Swingers " " without the wit or intelligence . It seems to have been written through the puerile eyes of a 14-year-old boy . For God 's sake , the characters in this movie are supposed to be white-collar , upright citizens--and they talk like some of the idiots I knew in freshman year of high school ! The dialogue is laced--more like drowned--with four-letter words . You would think that people of their status would have SOME degree of intelligence--and a more extensive vocabulary . Just watch a Whit Stillman film and you 'll see the difference . Not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish . If you know any successful , white-collar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movie--please let me know and introduce me to them . Their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty . There is absolutely NO insight into relationships , sex or ... anything ! ! ! It 's just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremely--and don 't take the word " " extremely " " for granted , because I mean it with all my heart--crude gags . These are gags with no substance . Gags that are meant more for groans than laughs . The scene at the end between Amanda Peet and her girlfriends was totally un-called for and totally unconvincing . There are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by ( straight ) men and play out wonderfully . This scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures . It involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a woman 's mouth . It was one of those noticeably-written-by-a-guy scenes . I wasn 't believing it for a second . " " Whipped " " is purely a sick male fantasy that 's as flat as it is annoying . I got ( very ) few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy , and those were probably a result of desperation . When you 're not laughing for a long period of time , you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things . So I wouldn 't mark that down as a positive . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie could be used in film classes in a " " How Not to Script a B-Movie " " course . There are inherent constrictions in a B-movie : Budgets are tight , Time is precious ( Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days ) and the actors are often green and inexperienced . The one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you . Scarecrow 's script seems to have been written in a drunken haze . I could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie , but I 'll just mention one : The Gravedigger . The character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie . He seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie . He is shown with his daughter , who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie . The gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count . Why give the Gravedigger a daughter ? Why give the daughter a boyfriend ? Why introduce them so late in the movie ? Why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline ? Scarecrow doesn 't seem to care.The " " story " " of Scarecrow goes something like this : Lester is a high school kid ( played by and actor who 'd I 'd peg to be in his early 30 's ) who is picked on by the other kids . He is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named Judy . His mom is a lush and the town whore . One of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings ( by calling him a " " faggot " " for drawing birds instead of " " monsters and cowboys . " " If you have a high school student still drawing cowboys I 'd think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows ) and later , kills Lester , in a cornfield , under the titular scarecrow . Magically , Lester 's soul goes into the scarecrow . Somehow , this transference changes Lester 's soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast ( I know some reviews have called the scarecrow a Kung-Fu scarecrow . I disagree . The scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie ) . The scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him , those who smoke pot in the corn field , those who dig graves , boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers , pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set.The bonus feature on the DVD should be mentioned . The director ( a Frenchman ) does an impromptu version of rap music , admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by ( and I 'm paraphrasing ) : " " Life ez a bitch , but et has a great ass " " Number of Beers I drank while watching this movie : 5 Did it help : No Number of Beers needed to enjoy this movie : Whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It is high time that American critics and fans alike start to debunk their unquestioned , sloppy veneration of films like Sergio Leone 's ' Once Upon a Time in America ' . The checkered history of this opulent film ( and the grand , fanciful myth associated with it 's production and many versions ) belies its mediocrity on a narrative level . The film lurches backward and forward in fits and starts , its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the ersatz decadence of towering sets , the minutia of production detail and the , by 1984 , cliche 'd but gorgeous cinematographic confection on offer to the audience . The plot 's time frame is confusing , gimmicky and laboured , leading some critics to imagine the Noodles figure 's opium binging to be the antecedent of some future ' dream reality ' as well as the sepia-toned remembrances . This ham handed , overly fan boy-apologetic interpretation glosses over the glaring narrative irregularities on display . Even at this full ( ? ) running time , figures appear and disappear with alarming suddenness : the Deborah character is fleetingly established in child form , a cold and unattainable ' trophy ' female , not even hinting at the gravity with which she will re-establish her relationship with a post-prison Noodles , the said re-union henceforth rings completely false . The deadening pace is somewhat to blame , certain sequences drag along stagnantly for far too long , signifying very little , hinting at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obligated to usurp every iota of screen time possible in order to show off his production , fatal for a film that contains figures so sullen and aloof . The trajectory of the figures ' lives is presented to us as a microcosm mirroring the historical trajectory of America 's teens through prohibition and its spoils , ending with the ( arguable ) ruin of its moribund central figures ( save Deborah- a make up department fumble or intentional one wonders ) . This notion is commonplace , even banal . The cast of characters as imagined in the one note script ( written by seven Italians no less ) are flatly and awkwardly played by all but the younger actors , who at least venture a few variant facial expressions . This is understandable given the almost unworkable material . Some critics state that the characters may seem so impenetrably self-absorbed , but actively seek their own goals , assuming the compliance of others ( e.g. when Noodles gets out of prison , Max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not this is what he desires and later makes deals assuming Noodles will comply ) . This explanation of their abrupt , abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily extraneous and merely serves to highlight the complicated ends the films unwavering supporters will go to to defend their positions regarding a film unfortunately short on sense . Although Ennio Morricone 's score is much revered , it is undeniably schmaltzy and repetitive , it gushes with an emotional redolence that the scenes themselves , many violent , just do not warrant . At points it is questionable whether or not Morricone was watching the same film I was so incongruous is his work . As a paean to American Filmmaking , it succeeds in terms of mood ( helped by a few strokes of masterful editing segueing between time periods ) and visuals ( not helped by said score ) but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The cover art ( which features a man holding a scary pellet gun ) would make it seem as if it 's a martial arts film .

If you like that stuff , then this film isn 't that bad really . However , consider these points : There are numerous close-ups of actors ' groins & butts , ( One scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants . ) the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime , peach , and red . From a cinematographer 's standpoint , this movie 's a drag queen ! Several scenes feature characters standing EXTREMELY close to one another , occasionally touching as they converse . Also , the cousin of the hero likes women , and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him . Is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey ? Shall I go into the fight scenes ? ( Yes , someone 's private parts get grabbed in one fight . ) The martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative .

" I remember catching this movie on one of the Showtime channels . What stood out for me is that this movie takes place entirely in Phoenix , Arizona . I 'm from there so I spot the locales easily.Regardless , a ninja kills a scientist , because they wear yellow sweaters and golf , who is pursued by the police . It takes about half the police force to take him down and when they do eventually kill him , there are no discernible bullet wounds . His spirit lives on however when a woman finds her and touches his katana.From then on , she periodically gets possessed and kills the police officers who killed the original ninja . Then another ninja from Japan comes to kill the evil ninja . This might be a plot device from the previous two films , or perhaps a plot hole .

" The reviewer from Poland must be a feminist , for she finds " " Young Catherine " " to be a great film and historically accurate . Nothing could be further from the truth . As a practicing Russian historian for many , many years I took exception with YC at almost every turn , and in particular the politically correct depiction of her as the boss who single-handed moved Russia into a direction of dominance . The truth ? She was only brought to St.Petersburg to be a wife and mother , and found she had to " " bond " " with the dvoriane , the boyars , and the military just to survive . So long as she did not challenge them she was able / permitted to indulge her cultural wishes ( filling up the Hermitage with art treasures , etc . ) . There are so many proofs that she was not " " great , " " but in this area of post-modern revisionism proof is not very popular .

This is by far the worst script to make it into the big screen ever . The acting by everyone else was pretty bad and over the top . The direction was horrible . A totally meaningless story , totally unrealistic characters and events and 1.5 hours to long . During emotional scenes pretty much everyone in the theater laughed . People just started walking out during the course of the screening . There 's no way to actually summarize the story into something coherent , so I wont even try .

Everything from the bear to the crash was something I could do myself , and better . I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production , seeing as the movie was not even called Hatchet . Finally , I do not think the writer had ever read the book , seeing as nothing was the same .

He uses a filming technique here as in other of his films , where he fast forwards the action from one location to another , usually involving a rider on a horse . It 's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930 's era Lone Star Westerns.Pre-Gabby George Hayes is on hand , sans whiskers , and this is the first time I 've seen him as a villain . In fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role , first as hunchbacked businessman " " Matt the Mute " , " communicating via pencil and paper , only to turn into Marvin Black , leader of a gang of outlaws . Black 's gang was responsible for the murders at Half Way House , in an attempt to coerce Sally into selling out to Matt / Marvin . Another staple player is here as well , Yakima Canutt as a Black henchman named Spike . Interestingly , Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser / Wayne oater , " " Neath the Arizona Skies " . " There 's a fair amount of time-killing horseback riding back and forth between Black 's Gang and the Sheriff 's posse , as John Wayne 's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys . In the end , he saves the day by securing Sally Rogers ' thirty thousand dollars , at the expense of destroying the Half Way House , where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe . Greedy Marvin Black attempts to open it with his six-shooter , and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain . In his best " " Aw shucks " " attitude , John Wayne falls under the spell of the pretty Sally Rogers , and alas , Randy rides alone no more ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I watched this film on the Hallmark Channel recently . In my opinion , the film started out decent enough , but eventually got sour.The Story : A U.S. soldier in Afghanistan receives one of the Christmas cards that a woman back in the U.S. has sent out to troops for Christmas . He becomes so inspired by the Christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life , a motivation to continue on . When he is given leave , he goes to the very town that the woman lives in . He comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the Christmas card . He meets the family and after saving her dad ( a Vietnam War Veteran ) from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street , the family decides to take him in for a while . We learn that he doesn 't have a family back home . The soldier agrees to help out the family during the Christmas season by working with them at their logging company . The family comes to love him and vice-versa . The soldier also becomes in love with the family 's daughter - the woman that sent the Christmas card . There 's only one problem . She already has a serious relationship with a man that she 's in love with . It 's also a long distance relationship . The boyfriend is very different from the soldier . He prefers wine and trips to France over hard labor and the great outdoors . The woman prefers the latter . Throughout the rest of the film , there is a " " love triangle " " as the woman 's boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season . Everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what 's best for her daughter . * * ( SPOILER ALERT ) * * The woman comes to like the soldier more and more , as they have a lot in common . They happen to spend a lot of time together . She gradually becomes attracted to his persona . Then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back . Now she 's so confused ! She 's in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday , but she 's become so fond of the soldier . Soon enough , the boyfriend ( who doesn 't know about the kiss , but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her ) decides to propose to the woman and she accepts . His plans for their marriage , however , are not plans that she wants . She wants to be at home , have kids and be close to her family . He wants to travel the world , go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along . This doesn 't sound too thrilling for the woman . However , the soldier feels bad about what he 's done and doesn 't want to make things worse . So , he decides to leave town , despite the dad 's urging him to stay and be with his daughter . It all comes to a head when , at the Christmas Eve service with Church , we find out that the soldier hasn 't left yet . The boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he , broken-hearted , basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her . The film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together.Things I like : I like the soldier throughout much of the film . He 's basically nice and polite , with a strong sense of doing good for others ; there are moments in which the family is going with Church and participating in charitable causes ; the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table ; the dad and mom have a long-lasting and evidently healthy marriage ; the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong Things I don 't like : There is a very typical " " love triangle " " story in this film ; the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend ; most of the family practically applauds this behavior - the family goes with Church and participates in services , yet this is how they act ; there is some bad language Conclusion : I became disappointed as the film ran on , and it got worse and worse . I ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because I had enough . So , the film started out decent with some few gem moments , but ended up ruining itself . Therefore , I don 't recommend this film to anyone . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Did the writers pay people to come up here and write positive reviews ? I mean , really , it 's a bit hackneyed , and Spike isn 't that funny . He seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny . There are so many mediocre gigs in this show ; like once , the opening sketch was " " Talk show , apply directly to the forehead , " " over and over . And another that featured Spike and another dude getting high , and it wasn 't even funny . They didn 't even do anything but sit around and laugh , over and over . Ha Ha !

" I don 't know much about film-making , but good movies have to tell some sort of a story ... your characters have to start and complete their journey . In Last Exit to Brooklyn they may , but its not in any satisfying way , and I 'm not meaning a happy ending , just ANY ending.Last Exit to Brooklyn , set in 1952 Brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike , sets a number of story threads in motion . Most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever walk across a movie screen . But Last Exit to Brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion ... it leaves some of them dangling with no ending , or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an " " artistic " " ending.Two cases in point , and they contain spoilers.A sad transvestite character ( an important character in the film ) , is struck by a car and killed . And that 's it for him in the movie .... he 's gone for good , erased from everyone 's memory .. no reactions from his friends , enemies , lovers .... nothing.In another thread the stupid , clueless , and secretly gay strike leader , having been rejected by labor , his gay lover , and found out by the neighborhood thugs , gets stomped by the thugs . The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn , and the streetlights are very , very similar to those of Nazi death camps ... and the scene drags on and on and on ... and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader , and he 's been crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez . And of course that 's it for him too .... brain erasure ..... gone.Bottom line .... no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film .... this movie is a depressing piece of sludge . Avoid it . And if you don 't be forewarned , it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical , emotional and sexual brutality ... don 't even let the teenagers watch . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've always been a great fan of Woody Allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past , but only a blind lover could ignore how dull , meaningless , pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is . A vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds . And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed " " actor Allen-clone " , " that is putting into Will Farrell 's mouth and gestures what Allen would have done in Farrell 's place had he been 30 years younger . The outcome was obviously ludicrous . And not to speak of the dialogues ... what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering , unaware of its comic effect .

" I tried . I really did . I thought that maybe , if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance , I could enjoy his movie . I know that after seeing O FANTASMA I felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core , but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor , so I was like , " " What the hell . At least you didn 't pay 10 dollars at the Quad . Give it a shot . " " Sometimes it 's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of so much pain . I often wonder if it wouldn 't be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it . On other occasions , I often think that the world is really flat and that if I sail away far enough , I will not only get away from it all , but fall clear over , and that some evil , Lovecraftian thing will snatch me with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze the life -- and some french fries from 1995 , still lingering inside my esophagus -- out of me.Is there a reason for Odete ? I 'd say not at all ... just that maybe her Creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness ( one that makes Alex Forrest look like Strawberry Shortcake ) look not only creepy , but flat-out sick to the bone . She first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend ( in shrieking hysterics ) because she wants a child and he believes they 're too young . She later crashes a funeral of a gay man , and -- get this -- in order to get closer to him , she feigns being pregnant while insinuating herself into the lives of the dead man 's mother and lover in the sickest of ways . Oh , of course , she shrieks like a banshee and throws herself not one , but a good three times on his grave . And there 's this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes " " Pedro " " which sums up some weak-as-bad-tea explanation that love knows no gender .

" The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work . In fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.At least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning . Black gore is hardly frightening , nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp Lugosi style.The narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine ' Naked Lunch ' directed by Russ Meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque . Otherwise give this film a wide girth . Bava and Argento fans - once again - are bitterly disappointed . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Hi , today i looked this film because of the medium ( 5,6 ) IMDb rating . I thought it would worth viewing . Also the comments here were quiet good but after start watching this movie i quick realize that this movie isn 't anyway near a 5,6 ! Its just boring . You can describe the movie with some words also its just the standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes . I don 't know why people still like those films or why they vote such films better then a 1-3 in IMDb . Just some examples Bunch of people arriving from somewhere or going / driving to anywhere . They meet somehow on their journey strange people but hey maybe they are just nice so hang out with them . Then a very important scene for every horror movie " " Oh my cell phone isn 't working oh oh mine too .. is that strange but we don 't need them so enjoy our ride ... " " uhhhhhh our strange person is a strange psychopath better we all sit back and scream a while till he starts cutting parts from us or killing some of us . After a while the bunch of victims get a weapon or chance to escape ofcorse they never think about running away or even kill the psychopath if they got the chance they just talk about what to do until the psychopath got his weapon back with any of the handful of standard tricks they got in those films and all running back as usual ... screaming ... some more to kill ... oh and in the end it gets really exiting sometimes the bad guy wins sometimes some of the victim can escape wow great movies . ... OK if i never ever saw a movie of that kind i would say it is a movie which can be watched but if anyone ever saw any movie of its kind it should be just a boring waste of time because nearly everything in the movie you know before you even watched it because it every time runs like the standard horror movie shematic . .... mmm maybe there is a windows program out there ?

" I really don 't get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it . Even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus . First of all , surely they could have 2 found real Irish people , and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up , haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film . Granted , the gore works- but strangely , it 's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars ' hot ( formerly ) tight bodies left and right . Probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain.So , if you don 't care at all about the following : - acting ( seriously , everyone sucked . I 've never witnessed this before . EVERYONE sucked ) .-plot ( some crappy horror movies are remotely linear , or at the very least surprising . This movie doesn 't make sense unless you 're as trashed as the writers obviously were ) . - theme ( Nothing to learn from this film . Nothing to be scared about in bed at night , nothing to contemplate or grasp , or explain to others ) . - soundtrack ( Crap , crap , crap . Music as ordinary and dull as the script ) . - scenery ( Could have been this film 's saving grace , but no ... nothing pleasing here . Even the rocks are fake ) .So , yeah . If you don 't care about that , and you 're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and " " women , " " this movie is for you .

" This movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop .

Waste of money , waste of time . After making movies like Rangeela , Satya , and Company he pulled a Coppola ( Godfather ) on us ; What were you thinking RGV ?

" National Treasure is about as over-rated and over-hyped as they come . Nicholas Cage is in no way a believable action hero , and this film is no " " Indiana Jones " . " People who have compared this movie to the Indian Jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rocker.I can 't really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for . Maybe the pre-teen audience will like it , but I found it to be absolutely ludicrous . I also can 't imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film . Simply put : it 's just OK at best.National Treasure is unimagined and uninspired , borrowing what it does have from " " The Da Vinci Code " . " I would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006 , and passing on this nonsense.The whole idea of being able to so easily steal the Declaration of Independence and run around all over Washington DC and Philadelphia with it ( while never damaging it once ) , while fighting the " " bad guys " " and experiencing what is supposed to be " " non-stop action " " is absurd . I particularly loved the scene with the Declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it . Oh brother ! Reminded me of that episode of the " " Brady Bunch " " where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans . Except , that episode of the Brady Bunch was much better than this whole film ! The idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the US is outlandish . Literally , there are thousand of undiscovered " " priceless " " items in this treasure trove . Yeah right ! ! Ridiculous ! ! Even worse , the speed and accuracy of which Cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be " " tough " " clues to these ancient riddles are pre-posterous ! ! ! Oh .. the humanity ! The performances by Cage , Voight , and the other actors in " " National Treasure " " are as stiff , wooden , and flat as they come . However , when you 're working with such lousy dialogue , it 's hard to fault the actor 's 100 % for that.National Treasure is an OK film to see once . I can 't recommend it beyond that and would definitely NOT purchase this over the top , outlandish scavenger hunt of a mess.Rent it if you must see it first ....... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" What 's to like about this movie ? ? ? It is in colour ! It has some impressive underwater photography ! It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times ! So 3 out of 10 ! Sometimes the music is speeded up ! Especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in ! Sometimes it is slowed ! As if to convey to the audience it 's about to be time for sympathy ! As another one bites the dust ! As if in a " " spagetti Western " " this has much similarity to ! It 's not that the Italians can 't produce quality productions ! There was a series of TV movies with a heading like " " Octopus " " numbered about 1 to 7 , screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s about mafia-type conflicts ! And they were excellent ! But alas , you won 't find it here ! ! ! I assumed it was made about 1960s ! Sadly it was 20 years out of date , as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end ! Then there was the razor-sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters ! Amidst it all , either in bar-room brawl or in observing the latest sea-side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark , the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern , as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone 's character development ! At least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly , for his ex-wife ! But of course , even if the music fails to awaken our realisation , we have the sinister sound in the baddies ' voices , as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge ! And near the end , someone thought of a twist ! Just when we thought it was all totally predictable ! But stay tuned , folks , for you may find another twist ! If you are watching closely ! To , more or less , warm your heart ! Follow the advice of the hero , and have a few beers along the way ! It 'll make your viewing of " " Night of the Sharks " " more enjoyable !

" I 'm at a loss . This entire movie made absolutely no sense . It was like watching a Soderburg film for football . The camera cutting , the pace , all so copied . I thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was . Yes , we all know Southerners like football and beauty pageants . Must we be inundated with it as an audience ? I watched because of Lee and Jay . I was expecting young talent assembled in the style of Dead Poet 's Society or similar to Remember the Titans . I was completely put off by the film . You didn 't get the characters . It was character driven , but you didn 't understand anyone 's motivations or their actions for the most part . The one kid who 's mom is obsessed with him being a football player . Why is he so silent ? What 's his deal ? Did we really need the scene with him " " proving " " his heterosexuality ? Why should we care ? The movie gave us insights into these kids lives , and offered no pay-off for caring . It just made no sense . And why show a movie about a team that lost ? I know it 's real life , but who makes movies about losers ? Give us some pay-off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their " " conceivable " " problems , darnit . We got nothing . We got a little blip at the end of the film telling us that Mojo won the next year with the 3rd stringer ( Lee ) . Why didn 't you follow that story ? What were we to get out of this one ? The movie led you along , but didn 't lead you anywhere . I just felt like something was missing . It felt like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans . At least those two movies led you somewhere . Friday Night Lights was about a loser team that lost their star player early in the movie . The actor who played him was great . You were completely annoyed by him , which was the point , but at least you understood why . They made sure you understood him , but he couldn 't play , so why make sure we get his issues ? And the other team in the play-offs ... are we to believe those are high school teens ? Those men looked like college seniors or professional player in their 30s . Who were they trying to kid ? I know the other team was to look intimidating , but that was crossing the line a little . I liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team , but again , how did this fit into the overall theme of the film . Nothing pieced together . The characters knew more about each other than we did , and that settles weird with me . Jay 's characters had absolutely nothing to add , but he was showcased . It was all just a mess .

It bridged the gap between the silly , manufactured , Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult , musically growing and evolving , and yet still a little silly Monkees of the ' 70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith 's , " " If they think we are plastic now , wait till they see how we do it . " " That the Monkees were tired of all of the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record . They said it over and over in interviews . They needed to re-make themselves , and what better way that to de-bunk and hilariously lampoon the very machine that created them .

" In my opinion , this movie 's title should be changed from " " Only the Brave " " to " " All About Lane " . " I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome . Although , I appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale . The performances of Marc Dacascos , Tamlyn Tomita , and Jason Scott Lee were all great . However , the director should have NEVER put himself as the main character in the movie . Sorry Lane , you are just not a film actor . Stick to what you 're good at - theater acting . Gina Hiraizumi 's performance in this film was also horrible . She should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a Miss Nisei queen . There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why weren 't they cast for that role ? Another major problem with this film were its action sequences . The Japanese-American soldiers don 't look like they were fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone . Granted this was a low budget feature , but since this was a war-based film , isn 't it important to show some actually fighting ? This film was a worthy attempt , but definitely not worth a major distribution . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I can also see how Zach might be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase / or is that Matthew Perry ? prat-fall induced chemical slide ( already acknowledged on Conan ) .

" I watched the whole movie , waiting and waiting for something to actually happen . Maybe it 's my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology ? Is it a weird re-telling of the Oedipal myth : I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him ? I didn 't understand why certain plot elements were even present : why was the construction upstairs , why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so , why have the scenes at all with the father at work , why have such a nice kitchen if you 're only going to eat takeout , why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around .

" That 's what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire flick . We couldn 't believe how stupid it was ! I think somebody shot this on their camcorder at home and snuck it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up . Well , I guess the joke is on us.I guess I should have come to this website first and read all of the reviews it has gotten , every single one says this movie is HORRIBLE , STUPID , and on and on . And boy are they right ! Although it did provide some pretty good laughs ( me and my friends were pretty drunk ) because it is so stupid . We just can 't believe somebody was dumb enough to make such a crappy movie ! I swear this had to be made in the 70 's before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene looks really crappy , but when I looked on here it said it was made in 2001 ? What ? It sure doesn 't look like a movie that would be made today , but I guess that 's what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using strobe lights and really fake looking lasers , and use real life people from your home town instead of actors or even aspiring actors . BTW-some of those chicks ( or were they drag queens , we couldn 't tell ! ) were so fugly , even my drunk horny college buddies wouldn 't touch them with a 50-foot pole.So there 's absolutely no appeal to this movie at all , bad acting , bad writing , bad directing , bad special effects , bad , bad , bad .

" Renown writer Mark Redfield ( as Edgar Allen Poe ) tries to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself , as a Baltimore , Maryland magazine publisher .

" I couldn 't stand to watch very much of this crap . This is your standard junk that certain annoying women love- old English era drama with lots of costumes and clich챕 characters that seem to be plucked from either directly from oliver twist or some other dickens novel . This uses the usual clich챕s from the Victorian era . Certain idiotic people really think that the whole emotional torture of that culture being so bloody repressed is somehow fascinating and romantic . This is sap , pure and utter junk and boring as watching grass grow .

The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders . Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception .

" I never fail to be amazed and horrified by the evil that has been predicated in the history of the world in the name of religion , and it seems that the machinations of the Catholic Church in Twentieth Century Ireland rank right up there near the top - considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some sobering effect.A Love Divided is the story of a real family scarred by ignorant intolerance and prejudice all in the name of an inane Church doctrine . At the beginning of the film , we are offered a view of the bucolic life in a small Irish village in which Sheila and Sean Cloney are happily married with two young children . Sean is Catholic and Sheila is Protestant , but she has no qualms with their children being raised as Catholic . There is no sign of any animosity between the Catholics and Protestants in the village . The peaceful and loving relationships are soon shattered when Sheila expresses the desire to have their older child attend the Protestant school . The local priest takes it upon himself to forbid this " " sin " " and soon has Sheila 's husband and the entire Catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father , the local dairy farmer . In an act of defiance and desperation , Sheila kidnaps her two daughters and flees from the area.Special note should be given to Orla Brady who plays Sheila . She gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn in to the emotional trauma in which she decides to reject the wishes of a husband she deeply loves in order to express her fervent desire to establish herself as independent from the pressures of the establishment . On an equal footing is Liam Cunningham who plays Sean for he gives a realistic portrait of a man not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between his love for her and the influence of Church and community.If fiction , this film would have been a compelling and interesting drama . Considering it is true , it changes to a horrific tragedy . In real life , the people and the village never fully recovered from the events that took place there . It took almost half a century for the Church to acknowledge its negative role in the events , and even though Sheila and Sean lived out their lives in the area , they never fully recovered from what was done to them by the religious leaders and their fellow villagers.Whether it be denying basic rights to education of choice , crashing planes into buildings , subjugating women , condemning whole races , or just plain on torture and murder , we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Wow , I swear this has never happened to me before혚 . I only watched " " Golden Temple Amazons " " yesterday and already I haven 't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film . That 's how brilliant this movie is , I guess ! By now I only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art , showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous Amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target . I often get fooled by appealing DVD covers 혯 especially Jess Franco ones 혯 and I still haven 't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences . Oh well혚 After reading the other user-comments , some parts of my memory returned although I still suspect to confuse this film with another Jess Franco masterpiece I watched the day before , namely " " Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro " " ( and , yes , that one had an awesome DVD cover as well ) . " " Golden Temple Amazons " " opens with a posse of hot white African Amazons 혯 I am aware of the contradiction but don 't blame me 혯 slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl because they were trespassing the turf with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple . Several years and hormonal changes later , the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge . She 's accompanied by a bunch of sleazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldn 't mind taking some gold back home . The rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze . Anal챠a Ivars , Eva L챕on and the other nameless Amazons are all regular Franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed . You better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves , as the rest of " " Golden Temple Amazons " " is a boring and incompetent mess . There 's hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler , bits and pieces of National Geographic documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff . The awesome DVD cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection , but opening the box is utter pointless . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" How to round up every possible clich챕 and stereotype existing in the genre of horror and then subsequently stuff them into one massively lousy movie ? The answer : " " Camp Blood " . " This is amateurish slasher nonsense made on a micro-budget and a little bit too obvious inspired by " " Friday the 13th " . " Four of the most intolerable teenage characters you 'll ever see 혯 they 're like a combination of ugly , stupid and annoying 혯 go camping and quickly find themselves pursued by a homicidal maniac in a clown suit . Don 't even ask me what the killer 's motivations were or even who he / she was , because if it did feature in the film , I totally missed it . This is one of the worst movies ever made , with no inspiration or craftsmanship whatsoever . The production values were so pitiable that there are actors playing multiple roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable . The only half-decent and worthwhile sequence throughout the whole of " " Camp Blood " " is the opening in which the impressively voluptuous Meredith O 'Brien has sex in the woods with her geeky boy scout . Yes , I 'm fully aware that this is a totally shallow remark to make , but then again this is a juvenile and retarded film , so who cares ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent I have sat through many movies that don 't particularly hold my interest , but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children . Parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children 's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children 's movies . Disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name.Technically , the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over-dubbed and unnatural . Personally I hate that , but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project . The " " acting " " reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices . Thankfully it was a very short movie.Now , before I come off like a video-geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick , the one thing that can save even the worst children 's movie is a positive message . Far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is . Let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given : If you are lost , don 't worry , you will inevitably find your way home.Approach wild animals without any fear.You can win any competition just because you " " know " " you can.and my favorite , the final message left in the film : It 's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" THE MEMORY KEEPER 'S DAUGHTER in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards was a highly successful bestseller and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation . So what happened when the novel became a made-for-television movie ? Perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay ( oops ! , teleplay ! ) by John Pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story . Perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by Mick Jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation . Perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the ' liquid tears ' musical score by Daniel Licht . For whatever of these ( or all of these ) reasons , this novel-to-film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with Down Syndrome . And for that it is worthy of attention . Dr. David Henry ( Dermot Mulroney ) , a successful orthopedic doctor , is married to the beautiful Norah ( Gretchen Mol ) and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy . On a stormy winter night in Kentucky Norah goes into labor and the Henry 's rush to a nearby clinic where David delivers his wife ( the doctor is caught in a snowstorm ) with the assistance of his old friend , nurse Caroline Gill ( Emily Watson ) . After the delivery of a perfect boy child ( Paul ) Norah continues to be in labor and ( surprisingly ... ) delivers an unexpected ( ! ) twin girl . David and Caroline immediately recognize that the little girl ( Phoebe ) is a ' mongoloid ' ( this is before the use of the term Down Syndrome ) and David , having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect ) decides to send Phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged : Caroline is to make the delivery and Norah is told the second twin died at birth . Caroline follows instructions , sees the conditions of the ' home ' where Phoebe is to be deposited , shrinks in horror , and decides to keep the child . Aided by a friendly trucker , Caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers Phoebe , finding a new life in her trucker 's Pittsburgh . Norah insists on a formal funeral for Phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs David 's psyche , and the Henry 's life goes on with only the one child Paul , leaving submerged pains about the lack of Phoebe 's presence . Norah gifts David with a camera ( ' peoples lives are like a camera , that 's where they live - in a room captured by a moment ' ) and David becomes obsessed with photography . Norah grieves , drinks , and loses David 's attention , while David traces Phoebe 's existence with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh . Paul ( Tyler Stentiford to Jamie Spilchuk ) grows up , discovers his mother 's infidelities and is angered about his father 's lack of communication and understanding , and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician , and off to Juilliard he goes . Meanwhile Phoebe ( Krystal Hope Nausbaum ) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl , and the manner in which the broken marriage of the Henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe 's and Paul 's lives coupled with the courage that has supported Caroline Gill 's struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with Down Syndrome forms the conclusion of the film . The cast of well-known actors tries hard , but only Emily Watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script . Jamie Spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with much promise . Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver . The film is a mess , but the message about acceptance of Down Syndrome children and adults is an important one . Grady Harp , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I love B movies , but I like to be aware from the beginning that I 'm watching one . I can 't believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and predators so bad . Aliens and Predator are AWESOME . This movie made a big joke out of them . The creators didn 't take this movie seriously at all . I am throughly disappointed in how the Strauss jerks handled this film . They made a mockery of amazing characters . It 's like they were trying to be serious in the beginning , then their writers got high and gave up . Almost nothing was continuous , the main characters were awful and were NOT Aliens or Predators . I am so ridiculously sad that no one takes Alien and Predators seriously anymore . These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films .

But after 5 minutes of watching , I noticed how horrible his acting was , he walks and talks so stupid the whole time , it 's fake and not convincing . It doesn 't end there , almost ALL the characters act so badly it 's laughable , the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce ( David ) , but the guy commits suicide early on and you don 't see him again , you never even know why he did it ! Everything about this movie screams low quality , I can 't believe how such a thing gets released ! I was tempted many times to stop watching , in fact I did , half way through it I decided to stop watching and turned the thing off , came to the IMDB to check what other 's thought about it , I found zero comments ( not surprised ) , so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it .

" I saw this film in its premier week in 1975 . I was 13 years old and at that time I found it adequate and somewhat fun . I then came to discover the WORLD of Doc Savage through the Bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories . I had no idea before any of this of the realm of Doc , but I fast became one of the most avid Doc Savage fans you could ever meet . I read ( and still own ) all of the Bantam books , I started going to comic book cons ( along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all manner of geeky fat kid events ) and had a wonderful time with each adventure I took with Doc and the ORIGINAL Fab 5 . Philip Jose Farmer 's Book - The Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day I have very fond feelings regarding my Doc phase . In so saying I have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat . It is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up . The screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story . These stories from the 30 's were short and if one looked at Lester Dent 's ( AKA Kenneth Robeson ) outline for writing them , they broke down into PERFECT 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment . One would have thought that with George Pal and Michael Anderson at the helm , it would have turned out better . The spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there , but then fall short . It is interesting to watch though in that they hired second-string character actors ( guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film ) who all acquit themselves very well . Paul Gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and Bill Lucking is a television perennial . All the rest have fallen off the map sadly . I do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero , but I fear I will not watch it much as it is too painful . I would say 0 but I give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction ( Doc 's answering machine at the end was a nice touch ) and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Less than two hundred and fifty years ago , the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history . This is the story of a buccaneer Captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the ports of the Caribbean to the trading houses of London ..... Hmm , that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a swashbuckling , pillaging , ripper of a movie doesn 't it ? Well it 's not . Tho it 's not totally without value as a curio piece . Out of 20th Century Fox , Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass . Direction is by Jacques Tourneur , the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing the Technicolor photography . Jean Peters is in the titular title role of Anne { AKA Captain Providence } and support comes from Louis Jourdan , Debra Paget , Herbert Marshall , Thomas Gomez & James Robertson Justice.Originally meant to be be based on true life pirate Anne Bonny , the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity , and finding herself , in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans . Filled with clich챕s and over familiar set pieces , the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring . Peters gives it a right good go , and Paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty . While Robertson Justice , although underused , actually looks the part and doesn 't overact like the rest of the male cast does . Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings , purely because it 's Tourneur in the directing chair . But there is no depth here , this is merely a job for Tourneur , a professional one granted , but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes . Disposable at best . 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing . " " A Walk on the Moon " " appears to have borrowed from other , better made films . The present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class Jews not far from Woodstock . The screen treatment by Pamela Gray doesn 't have much going for it , so it 's a puzzle why Mr. Goldwyn decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at direction.The Kantrowitz family is spending some time at the resort . We see them arrive at the small bungalow that is going to be their temporary home . Marty , the father , comes only for the week-end ; he works in what appears to be a family small appliance business repairing television sets , mostly . In a few days the first man will walk in space , so the excitement is evident.The Kantrowitz women are left behind . Pearl , Marty 's wife and her mother-in-law , Lilian , spend idle days in the place until the " " blouse salesman " " arrives . Pearl goes browsing and she finds much more than a shmatte ; she gets the salesman as well . It appears that Pearl and Marty have no sexual life at all . After two children , Pearl , who appears to be sexy and with a high libido is ready for some extra marital fun.That is the basic premise for the film , which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter , Alison , decides to play hooky and go to the Woodstock festival nearby where , horror of horrors , she witnesses her own mom making out with the blouse salesman ! What 's a girl to do ? Well , stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties are happily reunited by the little son 's bedside when he is stung by wasps and the salesman comes to apply some home remedy , and daddy is called from the city , after knowing about Pearl 's betrayal with the younger stud.Poor Diane Lane , she went to make " " Unfaithful " " later on , which is the upscale version of this dud . Viggo Mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female customers whispering little somethings in their ears ! Liev Schreiber as Marty , the cuckolded husband , doesn 't have much to do . Anna Paquin plays the rebellious Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is the unhappy Nana , who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first hand one that is playing in her own backyard !

" 1st watched 2 / 18 / 2007 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-Leon Leonard ) : Fair adventure movie based on a novel by the author of Moby Dick fame , Herman Melville . This movie is about the captain of a ship who had stolen the eyes ( that were extremely rare black pearls ) from a native tribe 's God sculpture and hidden them somewhere that only he knew about before leaving the Island of Tivi . He got very sick and was on a secret voyage to go back to the island to retrieve the pearls for himself while others ( like his daughter ) thought that he was going back to be treated by the local medicine man . Others didn 't know the reason for the voyage . A stowaway actually knew the real reason for the trip -- to return the eyes to their God . The silly part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and all this time the natives ran their tribe without their God having eyes ( causing them all kinds of problems ) . Along the way , we are treated ( for some reason ) to a short underwater nature show with an electric eel fighting a local octopus ( I guess only Herman Melville knows what this was all about ) . Once they get to the island , the Captain dies but passes the whereabouts of the pearls to his daughter but she also gets the sickness curse as well . One of the bad guys finds out where the God is housed and convinces the daughter to go there and steal back the pearls but at this point the good guys find out what 's going on and a fight ensues . I won 't tell you the results of the fight or the ending , I 'll leave that up to you to find out if you want . As I said earlier , the movie was OK , but some very silly things that I 've already mentioned lessened it 's impact . I wonder if that new " " Pirates of the Caribbean " " got some of it 's plot from this one ---hmm혚 black pearls , a curse ( I wonder혚 ) Well , it doesn 't matter , those elements didn 't make for a very good movie in this case or the other . It seems they would learn they 're lesson , but with the money rolling in on that newer movie I 'm sure they won 't . Oh well . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this , God that and Christ is our saviour stuff . The movie and the story line did not need it . If , as I am , you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous .

Disjointed for no reason , self indulgent and full of imagery that oscillates from the crass and obvious to the obscure and unintelligible , not particularly beautifully or grimily shot , I really don 't understand why this is considered classic , gay or otherwise .

" If John Waters had written and directed " " House of 1000 Corpses " " after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object , the result would probably be something like " " The Blood Shed .

Susan Adriensen ( Sno Cakes ) is incredibly annoying and Terry West ( Elvis Bullion ) is almost as bad in whatever it is he 's doing in front of the camera.Maybe the best thing about " " The Blood Shed " " is that it won 't take most viewers very long to forget about it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This was a Hindi movie . Hindi = Horrible. reasons : cheap dialogues , cheap special effects , cheap directing + stretching a 2 hr max movie into 3 hrs . % ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ spoiler ... little bit % % % % % % % % Specifically for this movie : 1. dialogues are not funny. they are cheesy , and cheap . Though akshay tried his best acting for which i admire him , comedy was not funny at all ! I laughed only 3 times during this movie . 2. first half of the movie was useless to the story of the 2nd half. the 2nd half was the actual story / movie. the first half was time pass / build up . 3 . The characters are not developed properly at all. paresh rawal is smart in the first half , an idiot in the 2nd half / rest of the movie. we don 't really develop any feelings or caring for akshay , and govinda. their characters are stupid nothing more. they do not seem to struggle in their difficulties . Jokes are funny , but they are not funny in a very serious scene. the characters of the gang and the drug smugglers are cheesy and have been used in last 20 movies. there is nothing new about those characters . Again , they are shown to be stupid for being funny. however , stupid = funny when stupid is the norm throughout the whole movie. the only character that made sense was that of lara dutta with a real story . 4. special effects were crap. at the end , ppl r fallin off the ladder of a fire truck. you notice that they are not actually on ladder in air. secondly , ppl start to fly off when the ladder starts to move around. ppl can 't fly off a ladder when its moving ... they fall directly to the ground due to something called gravity . 5. the whole movie was dubbed. all the dialogues were recorded after the movie . The actors ' lips hardly synced to the dialogues . There are probably many other reasons why this movie was crap , but i can 't remember them. look at this masterpiece of crappy Indian movies by non-intelligent , even stupid , director yourself and you will agree with my review. ppl who like Hindi movies , please increase your expectations for decent quality in Hindi movies . Let me say that not all Hindi movies are bad . I like some. i did not like this one . 1.5 / 10 ( 1.5 for the effort by akshay and lara ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Anyone who likes Van Damme has issues , It seems sad that the only way Van Damme ever gets any acting work is when he co writes the film , co produces the film and does the screen play for the film . AVOID VAN DAMME AND HIS SLICKED BACK NASTY WIG . I give this film a two out of ten , because the one with the the sandman was better . To add insult to injury I wasted a quid on this manure , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I thought this was a great idea but , boy , was it poorly executed . We do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of a show are , but virtually no specifics about any of it works . The producers don 't seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a " " through-line . " " ( Which is not to say they didn 't try , but having the stagehands relate a synopsis of the Ring cycle as the program 's narrative does nothing to tell us about the job of physically mounting an opera . ) We see lots of things happening , but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why . There 's little sense of who is who , or how the various production departments fit and work together . For instance , several times we hear about a problem of some sort -- one expects then to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it gets resolved . But instead the filmmakers generally just cut to something else ( generally , pretty generic footage of people pushing stuff or talking into headsets . ) Overall the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of images that you 'd see run under the closing credits of a show , rather than anything worth watching for its own merit . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is called " " Solomon Kane " . " Which it isn 't . The main character wears a hat , but that 's all he has in common with Robert Howard 's character Solomon Kane as known from early pulp magazines and lots of publications ever since these days . It is a fantasy movie , not really that bad and it might easily have passed with a rather good review - if it hadn 't been called Solomon Kane . The hero is a newly invented character who definitely is not SK . The story is not Robert Howard , neither.As a fantasy movie it is one more movie following the traditions of the genre : simple story , poor CGI , poor actors , poor directing . Yet it can be fun , you know : ' the cheaper they are , the better they are ' . But since it is called Solomon Kane , I cannot accept it . Imagine a Lord-of-the-Rings movie with a hero Bilbo who fights the black sorcerer Saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax . And with a final fight where the three use a magical ring to kill the evil sorcerer who has transformed into the dragon Gondorian . Imagine that . This is exactly what this movie has done with Robert Howard 's character Solomon Kane.I 'd give it a 4 stars review if it was just another horror movie , but since it is called Solomon Kane , I can only rate it 3 stars . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is just boring.It tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like Jeunet in " " Am챕lie Poulain " , " but it is too much . The dialogs are pretty bad , some of the worst I have ever heard , Guillaume Canet is not convincing ( I have almost never found him very convincing ) , his father in the movie plays very badly , the story is dumb , the ending is ... stupid.I think I have not dislike a movie so much since " " le pacte des loups " " ( brotherhood of the wolf ) from Christophe Gans ( and I watch / see about 80-100 movies a year ) , but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors.I had never commented here ( only rated ) , and when I saw the rating and the comments , I thought I had to write something down.I guess we won 't have problems to sell the DVD we were offered : not such a bad movie in our ( large ) collection ! ! ! I am open minded ( I watch SF , westerns , drama , comedies , silents , horror , fantasy ... movies ! ) , but this movie was so boring that I felt like I had lost one hour and a half . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The movie never becomes intolerable to watch . And to tell it straight , it has nothing to show either , except maybe part-sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy non-sexy character in revealing quite-sexy dresses . The story is very easy to follow or there 's nothing to follow -- you can see in either way . There is no suspense , little action , unimpressive dialogs , unsatisfactory sensuality , same boring locations and very bland acting . Kevin Dillon is totally worthless . Silverstone ... well , I didn 't concentrate too much on her acting , I confess . Yet as I said earlier , if one has nothing to do except watching a movie , this won 't look so bad . 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Every movie Quentin Tarantino has made has become progressively worse . I 'd like to believe that most people would agree with that statement , but seeing as " " Inglourious ( sic ) Basterds ( sic ) " " has an 8.5 / 10 from over 100,000 ratings , it doesn 't seem like the general movie-going public has any sense . Even his best work , Reservoir Dogs , wasn 't a ' masterpiece . ' The trouble is that claiming that you like Tarantino 's work has become trendy . As soon as that happens , you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon . They will ignore laughably terrible acting , and utterly self-indulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called " " everyone . " " This movie is so terrible , that I swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him . Like another reviewer has already said : " " Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies . This one is from a guy in love with his own writing . " " I couldn 't agree more . This movie is nothing more than self-indulgent and in-joke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play . But , thanks to the general movie going public , I 'm sure it will still go down as one of the best movies ever made . Bravo , Tarantino . You 've pulled-off one of the best practical jokes of all time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Ok let 's start with saying that when a dutch movie is bad , it 's REALLY BAD . Rarely something with a little bit of quality comes along ( Lek , Karakter ) here in holland but not often . Costa ! is about 4 girls going to Spain to go on vacation , party , get drunk , get laid ( u know the drill ) . It 's also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers . Pro 's who 're trying to lure the crowd into their club.I 'm not sure how long it took to write the script , but i suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you 're watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long . Nothing , and i mean nothing is believable in this movie . It 's almost too riduculous for words what happens with the storyline . Suddenly the movie transforms into a sort of karate action thing . With a one-on-one fight with ' the bad guy in black ' and cliche car chase scenes trough a watertank-car ( can it be more cheesy ) . Also the words character-development and casting are unfamiliar to the makers.After having seen " " Traffic " " 3 days before this , i fell from sheer brilliance , from a piece of art to this . This is film-making at it 's saddest . And don 't start about low budget . Because even with a low budget you could write a better script . It almost seems that the film-makers were too busy partying themselves to make a decent movie.Anyway the chicks in the water at the end made it up a little bit , but for the rest of it , don 't waste your money on such garbage . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The performances of Fishbourne ( who appears strangely funny somehow ) and ( short featured ) Ed Harris are remarkable , unlike Connery 's who doesn 't appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man . In fact the screenplay doesn 't make sense ; imagine a 60 min. happy ending-plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters . It 's more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen-wrights ' schools . The more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets . The capital punishment is not an issue here , although it is a subject from the beginning ; it sort of fades away without further comment . The subject-matter and environment could have been good . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sure , the concept had already been done with Alf and the Charmings : thrust modern society onto one or more out-of-place characters . But I loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990 . When I learned about Scorch , I was actually very hopeful for something new , as new TV in the 90 's so far hadn 't impressed me ( but at least Star Trek : TNG and the Simpsons were still going ) .What I got was a big disappointment . The acting was awful , but considering the ridiculous dialogue and wholly unbelievable writing , I can 't blame them too much for what they had to work with . There were a few humorous moments , but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery . The whole production work on the show seemed too low-budget for what was on TV at the time . In the 80 's it would have fit right in.Still , it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire premise of the series , so I gave it the benefit of the doubt . The second episode wasn 't as bad , and I started to get my hopes back that once it got into its stride , the show would improve . Sadly , my VCR ended up not recording the third episode aired , I never got to see it , and the series disappeared from the TV listings after that . All I have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air onto a VHS tape . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Wow , there 's a lot of venom directed at this movie , and a lot of it is deserved , but it 's not the WORST movie of all time . ( That 's probably " " Zoolander " . " ) Anyway , if you 're high on something , really drunk , or just in the mood for a " " B-minus- minus " " movie that you can make fun of , this may be your cup of tea.Yes , as others said , the first part of the movie makes you think you 're watching an updating of the Bram Stoker novel . Two of the main characters are named Van Helsing and Mina , the ship is the Demeter , and they 're in the Carpathian galaxy . You later find that Van Helsing is a descendant of the original , and he just happens to be on a ship in the 30th century with Dracula . Suuuuuuuuuuure.Oh yeah , and to add to the originality , this " " spooky ghost ship " " movie has another character named Ash . Sound familiar ? There 's paper-thin character development and anachronisms like the aforementioned manual wheelchair , and Coolio and Tom Lister talking 20th century black slang . But what really makes the movie ridiculous is the ending . If THAT 's what happens to the characters , then the previous two hours have been a waste.Like I said , it you want a dumb movie to play " " Mystery Science Theater " " with , and your mind is in approximately the same mode required for viewing the " " Great Vegetable Rebellion " " episode of LOST IN SPACE , then you may find this diverting . Otherwise , put a stake in it , it 's done . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" At the end of " " Dragon Heat , " " all I could think of was why I bothered sitting through the whole thing.The film 's premise is interesting and that - as well as Maggie Q - is what attracted me to the film in the first place . But was I ever disappointed . Writer-director Daniel Lee can 't hold a candle to the likes of John Woo , Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen.This has to be one of the most annoyingly-directed films I have ever seen . Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style - and I use that phrase incredibly loosely - that he fills the film with completely needless black-and-white stills , freeze frames , slow-motion , fast-motion and other visual nonsense . I suppose he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue.The action scenes are nothing special and play out like some hopped-up music video more than anything else . There is little to care about any of the characters - including two supposedly professional snipers who couldn 't hit the broad side of a barn from the inside ! - who are then laden with some of the cheesiest dialogue I have seen in one of these Hong Kong actioners.The plot is devoid of any twists and turns - from the initial set-up , everything unfolds in predictable fashion - and Lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters ' back stories in case we didn 't get it the first several times . This is awfully amateurish writing and film-making and wastes the talents of Sammo Hung , Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Though , to be frank , I am hard-pressed to remember Biehn being in any good film that was not directed by James Cameron.If you really are in the mood for a great Hong Kong actioner , you are much better off sticking to some of the staples - John Woo 's " " The Killer " " ( 1989 ) and " " Hard-Boiled " " ( 1992 ) , Ringo Lam 's " " City on Fire " " ( 1987 ) - which Quentin Tarantino stole for " " Reservoir Dogs " " ( 1992 ) - or his " " Point Blank " " ( 1967 ) remake , " " Full Contact " " ( 1992 ) . Or , even check out Yuen 's " " So Close " " ( 2002 ) , a supremely entertaining , yet preposterous , popcorn flick . And there 's always the terrific French police actioner , " " The Nest " " ( 2002 ) .True , most , if not all , are a bit over-the-top , but they were films that remain exciting , thrilling and even suspenseful . They have characters we care about and mind-blowing action sequences . " " Dragon Heat , " " on the other hand , is just terribly mediocre . The trouble is that Lee has not made a bad action film , he has made a dull one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" You see a movie titled ' battlespace ' , what are you going to think ? Space battles with cool as heck explosions and everyone shooting at each other . What do you get with this movie ? Well , you do get SOME space battle goodness , but for a great majority of the time it 's just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing . NO ONE TALKS ! ! ! ! What is this nonsense ? ! We get a narrators , and a ton of British computers , but thats about it . The main protagonist must be the worst one I have ever seen , as she doesn 't even have any dialog , and sleepwalks though scenes ( literately ! ) . Some of the things happening are just stupid , like they use a rocket ( like to go to space ) for basic transportation planet side , why not just use one of those nifty space ships ? In any case , the music is almost non-existent , with a few boring dull lifeless samples , but the main thing you will notice is the Atari sound effects the ships use ... you have got to be kidding me . I can also tell that the budget was low , because everything looks fake , which is not what you would expect from a movie , especially what should be a super cool space battle movie . I seriously think the budget must have been in the double digits it is so bad , making you laugh more than you should at how plain bad it is . I am starting to think that they paid the actors based on how much dialog they had , because their is very little here ( if you can 't tell already that is my main gripe here , as I probably said that like 3 times already ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This early role for Barbara Shelley ( in fact , her first in Britain after working in Italy ) , was made when she was 24 years old , and it 's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957 's " " Cat Girl . " " While blondes and brunettes get most of the attention ( I 'll always cherish Yutte Stensgaard ) , the lovely auburn-haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability ( one such example being 1960 's " " Village of the Damned , " " in which her screen time was much less than her character 's husband , George Sanders ) .She is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of " " Cat People , " " and is seen to great advantage throughout ( it 's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase ) .Her character apparently sleeps in the nude , and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened ( also exposed 8 years later in 1965 's " " Rasputin-The Mad Monk " " ) .The ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder ( I don 't see what held that dress up , but I 'd sure like to ) .All in all , proof positive that Barbara Shelley , in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses , rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable , a real test of star power , which she would find soon enough at Hammer 's studios in Bray , for the duration of the 1960 's . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is a desperate attempt to ride the skirtales of the success of the Star Wars movies .

" The plot : Four people are caught in an elevator . One is a business man , the annoying kind who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a walking-talking sample of distilled stress and hostility . Then there 's his colleague , a woman who is much more pleasant in her character . A teenage rebel who just broke into a coke machine and by his mere presence drives the businessman mad , and an older guy who just stole 100,000DM make up the rest of the cast ... The movie is all about how they cope with their problem , as time goes on and on without any success in reaching the outside world , as the lights go out , and as the cables begin to snap one after the other .... And yet , it isn 't too exciting . The characters are stereotypes . The story is stupid and unlikely ( how could so many things go so wrong in just one elevator ? ) . You don 't like the characters very much , you just hate one of them . And all the twists and turns in the plot are not contributing to the excitement , they are just stupid excuses for filling yet another few minutes with dialogue as the screenwriters keep running out of inspiration and ink on a full-length movie set in an elevator.Let 's just hope " " Phone Booth " " will be a better effort ... , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film was nothing more than exploitative gay cheesecake . It was not an " " art " " movie ; just an excuse to show several gratuitous , exploitative , over-the-top scenes with extensive male genital nudity . There was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men . The camera zooms in on the men 's asses and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their dicks in full screen view . There are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis . It gets redundant REAL fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously . I was wondering if I was watching a Playgirl video by mistake . If these same scenes were filmed using women ( ex : totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly ) it would be quickly dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy ... which is all that this film is . Any artistic merit got flushed down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality .

" The explosion of TV channels must be eternally grateful to the Randolph Scott Western production line , because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred Randolph Scott movies playing on at least one no-budget station . " " Man Behind The Gun " " is a typical early 1950 's period melodrama with pre-WWII production values that relies on a historically-topical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the script 's complete absence of character development , and thus lack of suspense . In years to come the role of these films would be taken over by TV shows like ' Gunsmoke ' , ' Bonanza ' , etc - and these actually did the job better . Randolph Scott , looking particularly grizzled in this , is the good guy , struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail . There 's no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling , unless you count wondering whether he 'll sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end . The music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the ' characters ' than the acting is . But it 's fine if that floats your boat ; and I wouldn 't berate you for enjoying ' Diagnosis , Murder ' , either.Workmanlike , pedestrian , and ageing rapidly . 3 stars for being competently put together ; 0 for artistic endeavour . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Not finding the right words is everybody 's problem in this vaudeville-type urban comedy . They don 't know what to say , and they don 't know how to say it , which is why they embark on the potentially humiliating enterprise of pre-arranged speed dating . Unfortunately , they all come across as cardboard characters rather than real people . The story follows a conventional three-act structure : getting to know the sizable cast in their sorry single lives , the actual dating circuit , and a final stretch of romantic fallout , showcasing some of the new-found couples ' follies . Because it 's all so predictable , I 'd say that as a narrative , " " Shoppen " " is a failure . As a comedy , most of the time it 's too goofy to be really funny . Thumbs up to Kathrin von Steinburg . She stands out from the soap opera crowd as the aloof , independently wealthy Miriam . Great makeup on her too ( Verena Wei횩ert ) : Heavy eye shadow meets skin-tone lip gloss , creating a brooding and bohemian , yet girlish effect .

" Horror films are a curious thing , sometimes they manage to stumble across a formula that works very well , sometimes they try valiantly to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems , sometimes they 're so bad they 're actually kinda fun ... and sometimes they 're " " The Cavern " . " A good horror / suspense film should contain vagaries that keep you guessing , they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivations so that you actually have some sort of reaction when they die . However , The Cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first , only to be negated by it 's own lackluster storytelling.All the characters are completely forgettable and any actual back story that might make any of them even remotely interesting is blurted out within a 30 second monologue , making it impossible to do anything more than laugh as characters are picked off almost at random and on more than one occasion in the least possibly frightening way . ( To spoil a scene a bit , one victim is taken during a complete blackout which might have been a little frightening if the sound effect used to indicate his killing wasn 't reminiscent of stirring a pot of too thick Macaroni and Cheese ) Add to this formula the camera that work makes me think the director saw one too many Nine Inch Nails videos and an ending which in an attempt to be shocking serves almost no purpose but to annoy and confuse the viewer and you have an almost completely unwatchable horror film that fails on every level.I 'll be honest with you , if you want a claustrophobic caving horror movie go watch " " The Descent " , " and I feel weird saying that because I didn 't particularly enjoy that movie either . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky , a likable ex-convict just released from prison who helps the feds nab a corrupt small town sheriff . Laid-back Reynolds was often accused by critics of merely phoning these ' good ol ' boy ' performances in ; true , he 's on auto-pilot throughout . But in his day , Reynolds knew just how to make a low-key effort work well for himself . Ingratiating and handsome , Reynolds comes as close to winking at the audience as he can without breaking up ; he seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star , while director Joesph Sargent provides an easy pace and a sweaty ambiance which brings the South alive . Unfortunately , the story isn 't much , and supporting actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins overact ( as usual ) .

" In the autobiographical coming-of-age tale " " Romulus , My Father , " " Eric Bana , of " " Munich " " fame , plays an impoverished German 챕migr챕 struggling to raise his son , Raymond ( Kodi Smit-McPhee ) , in rural 1960 's Australia . The major obstacle to the family 's stability and happiness is his wife , Christina ( Franka Potente ) , who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men . Despite her highly unconventional behavior , Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce , masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him . It is , unfortunately , the good-hearted and good-natured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie ( Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be an author ) .Even though I admire " " Romulus , My Father " " for what it is trying to do , I can 't honestly say I enjoyed it , for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it , these simply aren 't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing , which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen .

" This film appears to be an expos챕 of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry . Wineries around the world are more and more either joining large conglomerates ( the American producer , Mondavi , in the case of this film ) or paying high-priced experts to help them make " " the perfect wine " " --and as a result , wines are becoming very standard and predictable . To some , this is a good thing ( especially since few can afford to pay $ 50 or more for an everyday wine ) and to others this is horrible as the uniqueness of smaller wineries is disappearing . I truly can understand the concerns of both sides and don 't think there is a villain or hero in this business . Sure , good and cheaper wine is a nice thing , but like what 's happened with beers ( with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch ) , food ( McDonalds ) , shopping ( European shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from American ones ) and mega-stores ( like Walmart / Asda ) are taking away much of the uniqueness of " " the little guys " . " So I definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers . However , with a product that is almost two and a half hours long AND a general lack of focus , the film simply became too big a chore to watch and I lost interest . An 80-90 minute focused film would have been MUCH more effective--especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile ( that 's the high-brow word for a " " wine aficionado " " ) .On the very positive side , the film makers are smart not to do much talking at all--and simply let those on both sides of the issue do the talking . Plus , the topic is so relevant and timely . However , despite choosing a good style of documentary making , the film simply goes on way , way , way too long and ended up making a very dull film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It seems incredible that the same decade which brought Star Wars to the silvery screen disgorged such unutterable tripe as this and many other ' adventure ' movies . I am reminded of the similarly lavish , but equally wretched ' Ashanti ' outlined elsewhere.Whatever motivated A-list actors to sign-on for such wastes of celluloid is frankly beyond this writer . They must have been very , very desperate . To be perfectly candid , Roger Moore 's appearance in any movie is the kiss of death . Although extremely handsome in his youth , his entire acting career has been predicated upon an ability to raise one eyebrow . Every emotion from A to B is conveyed by this simple stratagem . His were the dog-days of James Bond . Lee Marvin on the other hand has featured in some very worthy outings , perhaps most memorably ' Paint Your Wagon ' and ' The Dirty Dozen ' . He has a comic streak , but he is much better when he plays it straight.The excellent Ian Holm is a throwaway , hardly recognisable blacked-up as a mute African . Everyone else just turned up for their pay-cheques.The only plausible and watchable element is the German cruiser . It looks like a very large model . But it is believably massive and appears authentic - as do its crew . The rest isn 't even hokum . The childish comedy jars with the brutality and violence in a story that meanders clumsily about , as if the script itself had had too many whiffs of Lee Marvin 's gin . Here is a director who simply doesn 't know where he 's going . There are hints of ' The African Queen ' , a snatch from ' The Pride & The Passion ' , ' Gold ' , and one or two other rip-offs from movies who 's titles don 't come readily to mind.Strangely , I have seen it 3 times , each occasion it has been shown on television when I have been laid low with a cold or the flu . Perhaps that is influencing my judgement - but not much.Compare it with any Indiana Jones movie and you will see what I mean.I have given it two stars ; one for the battleship and the other because it finally comes to an end , though heaven knows it takes long enough to do that.Time for another Lemsip , I think . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience , to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most . However , this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan ( who became annoying as hell in her own right ) . Her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles . This film might have been more , as there was suitable budget for settings , actors and a decent story line . My wife and I both agreed that this was ' Muck ' at the end , as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high ! Better luck next time , hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like From Hell . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

To say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement . To justify the title , there is a scene where Laure , who hardly speaks ten lines the whole movie , bathes in chocolate syrup .

" " " A young woman suffers from the delusion that she is a werewolf , based upon a family legend of an ancestor accused of and killed for allegedly being one . Due to her past treatment by men , she travels the countryside seducing and killing the men she meets . Falling in love with a kind man , her life appears to take a turn for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of thugs . Traumatized again by these latest events , the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge on the thugs , " " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis.Rino Di Silvestro 's " " La lupa mannara " " begins with full frontal , writhing , moaning dance by shapely blonde Annik Borel , who ( as Daniella Neseri ) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf . The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs . The opening " " flashback " " reveals her hairy ancestor was ( probably ) a lycanthropic creature . Ms. Borel is , unfortunately , not a werewolf ; she is merely a very strong lunatic.As a film , " " Werewolf Woman " " ( in English ) would have been better if Borel 's character really was a female werewolf ; with her sexual victimization a great bit of characterization . But , as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go , this one is hard to beat . Bouncy Borel is either nude or sexily clad throughout the film , which features a fair amount of gratuitous gore . Dazzling Dagmar Lassander ( as Elena ) and hunky Howard Ross ( as Luca ) are good supporting players . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I 'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice . The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention . The script is sub-standard ( it 's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it ) . The direction is worse . Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn ( more prevalent obviously in the " " uncut " " version ) . The cinematography is especially sub par , giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs . The movie should 've looked a whole lot better . The overall concept of placing name actors in what would 've easily been an X-rated movie ( Guccione called it " " paganography " " ) wears thin after the first hour after Peter O 'Toole and John Guilgud exit . Bob Guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste . If you want a far better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st Century watch the mid-79 's BBC production of I , CLAUDIUS instead ... and if you want porn , jeeze-Louise , look somewhere else . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie has been advertised for over three months in Greece as the biggest Greek production ever . Well , it could be , but ... When you hear of a big production you expect to see something new , something different . What you get to watch here is a movie with no reason of existence . George Corraface looks like he didn 't really enjoy making this movie . His acting is so simplistic , that looks almost amateur . The sound , especially when some of the Turkish actors speak English ( dubbed ? ) , is full of hiss . The , thankfully few , special effects showing Istanbul and Athens in the late 50 's and early 70 's are more like digital paintings than computer graphics . Finally , we see the same boy from 1959 ( age 5 ) up to 1968 ( age 14 ) , but in a miraculous way he becomes a teenager five years later.So much for " " the biggest Greek production " . " At least one would think that there would be some kind of interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production . And all one gets is a love story between 7 year-olds , who meet again 40 years later . Oh , there is a political side , too . A couple of ironic remarks about the Greek " " junta " " of ' 67- ' 74 , so childish that seem almost forced.There are , of course a couple of good things in the movie : most of the actors are great , mainly Ieroklis Michaelidis , the very good scenery and the magnificent music by Evanthia Remboutsika ; but they are so few for such an expensive production.Bottom-line : Is it so bad a movie ? To tell the truth I don 't know . I just know that in no point does it justify its huge ( for Greek standards ) budget . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just saw this film tonight and I have to say that it 's a mess . I love Vince Vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80 's classic " " Santa Claus the movie " " but with out the camp or the bad Sheena Easton song at the end . .The story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with North Pole as its setting . Of course Fred ( Vince Vaughn ) is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend ( Rachel Weisz in a cameo role ) dumping him , so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother Santa Claus ( Paul Giamatti ) and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of Christmas . Now if you think you know the ending of this film , I think you would be right because it 's predicable to the hill . As for the acting , Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable , Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus but the role is more than less one note , Elizabeth Banks plays Santa 's assistant but she 's not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film " " Glengarry Glen Ross " " but a little more anal . The only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is Paul Giamatti , who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as Santa Claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you can 't blame him and Rachel Weisz , who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs , which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them.To put it in a nutshell , a major disappointment . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie . I 'm still not sure if I regret it or not . I felt like I was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didn 't quite make the cut . It plays up every Hollywood clich챕 imaginable , all the while flogging us with the ' corporations are the ultimate evil ' message . Subtlety this movie does not know . As far as that goes , it even manages to provide it 's own spoilers.The story appears to be a computer nerd 's fantasy world come true . The lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend , yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker ( I think ) , among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you 'll have to see for yourself.As well , I should 've known it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he tends to be a good tip-off.Can 't recommend this one , I 'm afraid . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional Japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads ' KUSHIATA KYOTO , JAPAN 1840 ' . A young Japanese trainee Samurai named Masanori ( Toshiya Maruyama ) walks up the winding path to the house , inside waits Otami ( Mako Hattori ) with whom he is having an affair behind her husband , Shugoro 's ( Tsuiyuki Sasaki as Toshiyuki Sasaki ) back who happens to be Masanori 's teacher . Shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other . His honour destroyed the enraged Samurai brutally murders both Otami and Masanori before committing suicide . Over a century later and Ted Fletcher ( Edward Albert ) arrives in Japan on a working holiday with his wife Laura ( Susan George ) and their young daughter Amy ( Amy Barrett ) . Their close friend Alex Curtis ( Doug McClure ) who works for the American consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay , you don 't need me to you where ! He jokingly says it 's going so cheap because it 's haunted , to which both Ted and Laura laugh off as they obviously don 't believe in ghosts , at least for the time being that is . Almost immediately the film goes into clich챕 mode . Lights turn on and off by themselves , Laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local Zen Monk ( Henry Mitowa ) gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it 's too late which they ignore , of course . The spirits of Otami , Masanori and Shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a Majyo witches ( Tsuyako Olajima ) curse put upon them . But there may be a way they can break the curse , unfortunately for the Fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage , daughter and possibly even their very lives . Directed by Kevin Connor I thought this was a pretty average film , OK to watch once if you 've got nothing better to do but after a day or two you 'll probably have completely forgotten it . Nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there 's nothing particularly good about the film either . The script by Robert Suhosky from the novel by James Hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by-the-numbers , a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn 't help things . There are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get Amy and her babysitter , Noriko ( Mayumi Umeda ) . And there is a scene where the Zen Monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in , however that is until Ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in , some exorcism ! One more thing , I think it was a bad idea to have Doug McClure who was 47 when he made this , try his hand at Kung-Fu and oriental sword fighting ! George gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with McClure , although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present . Apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there 's no blood , gore or violence to speak about . The ' transparent ' ghost effects are OK but they ain 't going to impress many people these days . It 's professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the Japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in America , England or any Western country without having to change a thing . An OK time waster . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" First , let me state that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd ; that 's why I was curious to check out this , her debut role . No argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent . I guess I can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story . However , I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails.By the halfway point , I found myself thinking , " " How much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl , idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop , rearranging the merchandise ? " " It seemed to go on forever ! Then , I thought , maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event . No such luck . The movie continues it 's bland , boring , uneventful story all the way to the end.I 'm not saying this because I 'm an action-junkie . I like all kinds of movies , especially romantic-comedies . But I expect to be entertained.Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor 's bad home movies .

I am a fan of Julian Sans , but this is worse than I would hope for him.On the other hand the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and I had yet to see what pain looked like first hand . Perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction , but then again I know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me , especially when we had to turn the video off , and that simply is NOT done with our watching ( we had to make one exception obviously ) .

Hell Ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that Tarantino brought back , and did right , in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs .

The brief case in Pulp Fiction , the air gun in No Country , etc. etc . Speaking of Bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie ? I couldn 't help but laugh at those scenes where he 's standing with his pelvis trusted out , desperately trying to seem like some hardened biker . Nothing in this movie is believable .

" I saw this movie for a number of reasons the main being Mira Sorvino . With her on the cast it couldn 't be so bad . And it even seemed like it had some mystery and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good in ' Unfaithful ' . The story is set in Spain so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses.If you 're thinking about the same thing let me warn you : this is a truly awful , uninteresting , boring movie . The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic.The story is contrived with sub-plots that add nothing to the narrative . They try to build a slasher / thriller with a look at fascism in Spain but fail horribly . The twists have no credibility and the so-called investigation leads nowhere.The characters are paper-thin ! I didn 't care about anyone . More than that they 're irritating and pretty hateful people.The acting is atrocious . Mira what is wrong with you ? Why Mira ? You 're an oscar winner ! Keep some dignity ! Her character was weak but that is no excuse for such an awful performance . She seems to be sleepwalking all movie long . Come to think of it , I actually think I saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes . I used to think this woman was sexy . Well she isn 't here . If you want to look at some skin try Romi and Michelle because there 's nothing to see here . And that accent ? My god ... Olivier Martinez is even worst . It 's too painful to remember his performance to describe it here . Im sorry but I can쨈t . Ive suffered enough with this garbage.This whole movie is depressing !

The only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs . I was a DJ in the seventies and even went to the ABBA concert at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in Sept of 79 , so I did appreciate them then and I still do now . But this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce . The sequences were so poorly staged , the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be Meryl 's worst production . I cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage .

" This wilfully bizarre adaptation of Borges short story is typical Cox . His strong visual sense is , as usual , undone by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast .

" At what point exactly does a good movie go bad ? When does a movie go from " " watchable " " to " " where 's that & ^ @ _ + # ! * OFF switch " " ? Thank goodness for DVDs , like this one , that can be borrowed from the library - for free ! Likewise , thank goodness for the " " fast forward " " switch on the DVD player . I feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office.At one point ( I 've forgotten exactly when because now it 's all just a blur ) , our " " hero , " " Luke Wilson starts running through traffic ; I think he was looking for a cab . It was at that point when I gave up , realizing I couldn 't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck.The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbs out of the dumpster , hair dryer in hand , and first meets the " " heroine , " " Uma Thurman . That scene ended with the purse-snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far , far above the departing Luke and Uma . That was the last time the movie was funny , and when was that scene ? Ten minutes into the flick ? Every time the movie tried to become " " funny , " " it couldn 't . Every time the movie approached " " excitement , " " it fizzled out , heading in the opposite direction . When a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard , the sound track stayed empty and silent.The sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame ; the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish . When Uma turns into the crazy ex-girlfriend , I felt like I was watching " " The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction " " ; that 's when I realized that there was no turning back because I thoroughly disliked " " The 40 Year Old Virgin " " and " " Pulp Fiction . " " Luke Wilson 's sidekick , Rainn Wilson ( also seen in the dreary " " The Last Mimzy " " ) adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie . Rainn Wilson , the King of Television Boredom , should stay with that equally awful medium . Hey , Rainn Wilson ! Leave full-length motion pictures alone ! Every time Uma 's rival , Anna Faris , came on screen , I expected Jason or Freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery ; once you see Anna Faris in " " Scary Movie , " " that 's all you ever see , no matter the movie , no matter the medium .

" This is a kind of genre thing , meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you don 't . If you do , you 'll love this . Personally , I prefer the 1930s and most of the ' 40s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers , and Eleanor Powell , Bill Robinson , Ruby Keeler , James Cagney , Shirley Temple and so forth but the songs of the ' 50s , the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off.This film is a case-in-point . The first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me . By then , the story didn 't have much appeal , either . The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus . I don 't think I 've seen a movie she starred in that I liked , including this one , where the goody two-shoes English teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave Siam . ( I which she had ! ) . However , divorcing myself from likes-and-dislikes , there is no denying this Rogers and Hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks , particularly those who liked " " The Sound Of Music " " a decade later . There are similarities in the R & H musicals . Thus , if you liked the Julie Andrews flick , you should like this , too . This is a Lavish production with , yes , a capital " " L. " " This is the kind of big-production musicals you rarely saw after that generation . You also get the dubbed singers , unlike today , where the actress isn 't able to really sing so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue of Kerr , as she did with Natalie Wood in " " West Side Story " " and Audrey Hepburn in " " My Fair Lady . " " Yul Brynner is " " King Mongkut " " and is the stereotypical traditionalist , the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way . He isn 't " " progressive , " " as the left wingers like the say , but the education teacher ( Kerr , as " " Anna Leonowens " " ) will set him straight . Secular-progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer ! However , Yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more-bark-than-bite character . Justifiably , he is the big star of this film . Brynner had magnetism . Even in " " The Magnificent Seven , " " Yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience.In summary , it 's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it .

" I wasn 't sure where this was headed until the ending. when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to European wimps and the United Nations . What a load of right-wing crud ! Incidentally , the bit about Canada joining the US didn 't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed . The only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for President ( but they could have just made him American and dispensed with that ) . In any event , this was a load of bull and not worth your time . If you wan 't to see this kind of thing done well , check out the brilliant BBC political thriller " " State of Play .

" I see people writing about how great this movie was . It was horrible ! The acting was sub-par at best . It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo . Where the hell did they get the money ? Anyway , I wanted to learn more about the Titanic ; why it sank , what was running through a lot of people 's minds ; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff . Does anyone realize that certain people didn 't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off ? No , you don 't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked ( did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid ? ) .I did cry in during one scene , though . The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship . It looked like pool water ! I 'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn 't even make the water from the ocean look real ? unbelievable ... Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank .. Just ridiculous .

This movie is so bad there are not words to describe it . If I got a video camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half it would be a heck of a lot more entertaining than this . The plot is so dull and unimaginitive it is not even worth mentioning .

" Abysmal pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre . Lousy audio thankfully obscures the dumb dialog . And it 's awfully talky for a movie about people who don 't speak English . There 's no adventure to be found here ; it 's a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and one wild animal attack that happens in flashback.Three pale-face dopes wander the African wilderness and encounter warring man-hungry tribes of Amazons . These wild women have advanced out of the Stone Age only so far as to invent makeup , shoes , and underarm hair removal technology . Despite their desperation for " " hus-bahnd , " " the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weaker ones.The only thing of interest , as if there were any question , is the assortment of young women clad in animal skins cleverly designed like the bathing suits of 1951 . Plenty of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripless 1950s stripper moves . No nudity or appreciable violence .

" I 've got to say that I 'm not a massive fan of Troma films . Granted , I 've only seen three of them ( or four including this one ) , but two ( Blood Sucking Freaks and Mothers ' Day ) are widely reputed to be the best , which leads me to believe that all the others aren 't worth seeing . That would certainly seem to be the case with Graduation Day , which is a Troma take on the over-popular eighties slasher . While the film is never particularly bad ( given the type of film ) , it 's never particularly good either ; and by the end , all I could think about was ' why did I bother watching this ? ' . Anyway , the plot sees some girl die on a race track , and shortly thereafter ; more people start dying . Naturally , there are a few possible suspects ; but it 's hard to really care about anything that happens . Of course , in slasher terms ; it 's the gore that is most important , and given Troma 's track record where the red stuff is concerned , I was expecting buckets of it . There are some decent kill scenes , and some of them are gory ; but it 's never very shocking , which really just makes this another dreary slasher based on a celebratory event on the American calendar . It 's worth noting that there 's a small role in this film for sleaze queen Linnea Quigley , but the rest of the cast aren 't worth mentioning . The direction , plot and its execution are all very mundane ; and I will say that unless you 're a big Troma fan or someone that wants to track down every slasher ever made ; don 't bother with this film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of Adolf Hitler that I have ever watched . Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor , but to cast him as Hitler is just plain wrong . To cast Liev Schrieber as Hitler 's longtime friend and aid , Haefengstal must have emitted cries of despair and anguish from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre . A J-W playing a Nazi supporter , bad bad bad casting . This was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background . This was Hollywood rubbish at its finest , cashing in on the strength of a strong ( but sorely under utilized ) supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past 5 years.The fake German accents ( vee vill vin zis var ) is insulting to German people everywhere . My mother is German and she sat fuming at the sound of the voices which kept switching from American / English / German all in the same sentence . The supporting cast make better cardboard cutouts at the local video store than they do on screen . Jenna Malone as the fated Geli Raubal , was splendid though , she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in Hitler 's shadow.If you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of Hitler 's early years leading up to and including the war / holocaust , rent " " Inside the Third Reich " " 1983 starring Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler . It was good and made more sense then this baloney.As a historical researcher of the Third Reich I can honestly tell you , this had me reaching for my books to confirm its myriad of inaccuracies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I got hold of this film on DVD with the title Evil Never Sleeps , it gives front cover billing to Carrie Ann Moss , but she plays such a minor character that I didn 't really notice her in the film.I 'm afraid that I consider this one of the worst purchases I have ever made . The dialogue was stilted and the delivery wooden , I found the acting to be disconnected from the plot . Graham 's performance to me was of someone who 's wondering whether she 's left the gas on at home.All in all both my wife and I found this film painful to watch , and it is not a valuable addition to my collection , watch it at your peril , but spending 90 minutes having your fingernails pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so clever they have a story that fits the time . Remember the all-around political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading to the Watergate and a little later ? Most movies trying to cash in on made-for-TV ' o so powerful , o so mind numbing ' conspiracies were in fact caught in their own navel-gazing attitude.I was never a fan of The Conversation which I find as much dated as others conspiracy stints of the time but Coppola was true to his main character and Hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe . I mean these conspiracy movies are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir heroes . Lots of questions unanswered , lots of dis-communication ... Well this takes at least Bergman to build a movie about such un-visual bases.The Next Man is a perfect example of its time : one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy tightening its web around him . Neither part is interesting in itself and the whole doesn 't get any better . In fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences piling up ' watcha that ' murders without ever advancing any storyline . Pedestrian directing at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively brought under the viewer 's eyes . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it just looks so horribly bad . And indeed , we couldn 't take most of it . There was a lot of fast-forwarding going on.But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist ( her name somehow slips my mind at this time ) . CRIPES . I 've never watched a single scene from a film so many times ( I 'm estimating forty or so ) . And I 've never laughed so hard in my life . You see , Englund has this thing for showing off his loins . I last saw the film a couple months ago , but I can 't stop laughing as I type . Anyway , the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl , Englund riding a horse naked , and some mysterious woman fellating a snake 's head . This is absolute genius . You 've got to see it for yourself . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There seems to be little in the way of middle ground where Watch On the Rhine is concerned . One either likes it very much , applauding its sincerity , its liberal point of view and fine acting , or else loathes its obvious propaganda , mediocre dialogue , cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness . I fall very much in the latter category , and found the film and play , --concerning the activities of European refugees in Washington during wartime--a crushing bore , worthwhile mostly for the acting , and even then only intermittently . That author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant . Her plays were written for people who shared her point of view , and she seldom explored ideas that weren 't already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the " " other side " " is . Even when I find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say , --as in Rhine--I still can 't stand the way she says it . Her characters are unreal , and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality . She really had nothing new to say . I thoroughly agree with the late Mary McCarthy 's long overdue dismantling of Hellman reputation some years ago . For those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days , I urge a peek at Watch On the Rhine , as bad in its way as Angels In America , which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This final installment of the " " Airport " " franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn 't a slapstick comedy , like " " Airplane " .

You 'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm . The passengers were unintentionally hilarious , as was the interior of the plane . The sophisticated French woman coming on to slobby George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy coming on to Ernest Borgnine . Ain 't gonna happen .

" Two kinds of movies we like are ( 1 ) westerns , and ( 2 ) movies from 30 or 40 years ago . We ought to have liked A Man Called Sledge ; BUT ..... BUT ... this picture is disagreeable , annoying and stupid from start to finish . Since there is nobody in the story ( good or bad ) to warm up to , there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested . No camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold , and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it . Sledge has a pretty girl friend , but there 's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no-account pig.The film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score , and from extremely bad writing and direction by Vic Morrow.Of the last 30 older movies rented from Netflix or Video Vault , this was the rock bottom , the only true dud in the bunch . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If you 've ever wanted to see a film that stresses style over substance , this is for you . To me , Son de Mar is beautiful to SEE , but there 's precious little substance , unless mawkish , melodramatic , manipulative love yarns turn you on . This may be one of those famous ' chick flicks ' you 've heard so much about . We 're about half-way through this film before anything really happens : Ulises ( Jordi Molla ) goes out to sea looking for tuna , and doesn 't come back , leaving his wife Martina ( Leonor Watling ) and son to fend for themselves . Then , in a furious six minutes of screen time , they bury Ulises , Martina gets married again , and her son grows into mid-childhood . This rapid transposition is jarring , to say the least , and very sloppy : after 40 minutes of more or less hanging around , we 're suddenly into a full-blown melodrama , all in six minutes . I think this is called wayward narrative pacing.Five years later , Ulises ( as in the wandering superhero Ulysses ; get it ? ) , returns to his ' Penelope ' ( Watling ) only to find she 's married to Sierra ( Eduard Fernandez ) , an inexplicably wealthy guy ( what does he DO to earn all that dough ? ) who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets . When Martina , in great anger , questions Ulises about his absence , he tells her that he 'll take her to the island of Sumatra someday and she 'll understand EVERYTHING.And here 's the thing : he DOESN 'T take her to the island of Sumatra . The reference just dies somewhere in the script . He DOESN 'T really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years . He DOESN 'T acquit himself as an honourable guy , and the movie DOESN 'T fill in the plot holes that are staring at us for at least half of the film . I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants us to fill in the story lines with the mystical clues ( fish , reptiles , the sea ) he offers through breathtaking cinematography and evasive dialogue . It just doesn 't work . The narrative ' arc ' on this film ends up looking more like a wobbly clothesline.I 'm sure Jordi Molla is a good actor , but I just couldn 't buy his Ulises as any kind of hero ( which is what the original Ulysses was supposed to be ) . With moist sensuality , he spouts a short stanza of identical poetry from Virgil roughly 2,000 times and each and every time it excites Martina to explosive orgasm . This guy should be rented out to reinvigorate stale marriages . I 'm sure Virgil would be impressed . He didn 't get laid that often , as I understand it . This poetic ' device ' figures prominently in the film , and I had no choice but to assume it was a gender reversal of Ulysses ' famous ' siren song ' ( i.e. beautiful maidens singing seductively to far-off sailors , who were doomed if they answered the , well , siren call ) . If this is what Bigas Luna is up to , you can see the problem -- he 's offering convoluted symbolism in a snatch-and-grab attempt at High Art . Once again , it just doesn 't work , at least in my eyes.Watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor , but she gives us a character here who doesn 't seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth . It 's beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who sports a for-rent sign on his face ( as in vacant ) , oily 1960s-style hair that looks more like seaweed , and one of those trendy 21st-century ' beards ' ( you know , four days ' growth , no more , no less ) . He 's SUPPOSED to be a dreamy kind of guy ( I think ) , but those eyes of his suggest he might be suffering more from overexposure to a preposterous script . But , don 't despair , this film is great to look at . Just don 't try to connect the dots on the red herrings or think too much about what you 're hearing in the way of dialogue . You can do a lost of fast-forwarding on this film ( particularly in the first 40 minutes ) and you really won 't miss much . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Sometimes a premise starts out good , but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention-deficit disorder , it devolves into an incongruous mess . And for three well-respected actors who have made better work before and after , this is a mortal shame.So let 's see . Premise : a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop . Interesting to say the least . Make the encroaching cop a little disturbing , why not . It was well done in THE HAND WHO ROCKS THE CRADLE and SINGLE WHITE FEMALE , and it 's a proved ticket to a successful thriller.Now herein lies the dilemma . Create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous , or throw any semblance to reality , amp up the shock factor , and make this cop so extreme -- an ultra bad variation of every other super-villain that 's hit cinemas since the silent age.The producers , and directors , chose the latter . Thus is the resulting film -- badly made , with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they 've essayed before , and nothing much amounting to even less . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Anyway , the ending is unexpectedly well done ( well , just a little ) and that saves a little the film . Actors are known and with great quality , nevertheless , they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting ; all of them have done better papers in other film .

" This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof . Its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and not at all funny.Even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from India who 's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren 't really funny . The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn 't get any laughs either.The plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof . It 's a classic and trite sports theme . But alas , the screenplay was too weak for ANY cast to pull it off . And this cast is no exception.There is gratuitous use of women in bikinis and underwear , so it 's not all bad from that aspect.But Animal House or Talladega Nights , this is not . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions , although , the ' gross out ' , meant to be ' shock comic ' scenes , ( one involving an amputated testicle , and another set in a sperm bank ) are just plain awful .

" I never comment on a film , but I have to say that this was one of the worst films that I have ever seen . I feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students , but this was horrible ! I did not buy the lead actress and felt I was in acting class with her while she was on film . Her decisions were very safe and I feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions . The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves . The end may have made a little more sense if there was someone narrating the events and not a song . I love Patsy Cline but she her songs appear quite frequently in films . Maybe the song selection could have been a little more original . The song " " crazy " " was such a clich챕 .

" If Edward Woodward was the the flicks watching this film then that 's what he would scream out in horror . I 'm sorry folks but enough 's enough . We had Get Carter , The Italian Job , Alfie and now this . What 's the similarities ? No . It 's not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals star Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars another great British actor . The main common ingredient in those originals IS the britishness of the films . They weren 't made to impress Hollywood . They were quirky English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that just cannot be replicated in the USA . The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult film than to bastardise it with a remake or even a sequel . Wicker 06 had a tough task before it even hit the road . Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic that other said cult films ; it defies genre , intelligent scripts , A-grade actors , the music score , set-pieces that defy description and all the stories surrounding the film.So here comes a remake . Don 't worry . No originals were harmed in the making of this remake . Some major aspects of the story needed to be reworked for the modern USA - communications , paganism , virgins . But that 's just about the whole premise . So we give the cop a Nam style trauma past complete with shock music flashbacks for the cheap scares . Then with no mobile phone mast on the island that sorts the communication out - but in the real world this wouldn 't happen . Cops just don 't go missing . Give him a blood link for motivation rather than the clash of beliefs and you have the remake . Wafer thin though , isn 't it ? It 's just that it was all laid on with a trowel . The name alterations were simply hammy , almost Carry On , there was no sense of community on the island , no centre of town to catch your bearings , just a few houses dotted about a forest and that was it . Willow was just annoying by not giving out any info at all and Cage was useless to let her get away with it . When he went into the well you just knew he would get locked it . The screenplay was signposted all the way to the end - and you just wanted it to hurry up and end . The epilogue was absolutely hilarious and didn 't know when to stop . That ending is probably the best way to summarise the difference between the two . One ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrific day . The other ends with a post-production explain-it-all-to-the-thickies type conclusion.I loved the original but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the film .

" When I decided to try watching a movie about cryogenic zombies ( " " cryonoids " " ) , I wasn 't expecting a whole lot . That 's exactly what I got , and then even less . Aside from a shortage of special effects ( squibs ? ) and a severe lack of any acting talent , " " The Chilling " " also sports the absolute worst script I 've ever seen made into a movie . I had to stop the tape numerous times during the first 45 minutes in order to repair the damage done to my intellect for witnessing such atrocious dialogue as there is found here.Furthermore , the collection of characters is so formulaic and one-dimensional it 's ridiculous : the corrupt doctor ; his assistant , played by Linda Blair ( we know she 's his " " assistant " " because he repeatedly refers to her by that title ) ; the recently-widowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest with Blair 's character ; his criminal son ; the Blair character 's alcoholic , abusive , unemployed boyfriend , whom we are introduced to in the most contrived use of a flashback ; and , of course , the rough , tough , bearded security guard who becomes the hero.Apparently , the preserving fluid which some cryogenics lab uses on its bodies is highly conductive , naturally resulting in disaster when all of the lab 's containers end up outdoors in a remarkable sequence of events during a lightning storm ( on Halloween night , no less ) . As for the zombies themselves , if you enjoy watching people in green latex masks walking around in aluminum foil suits , then " " The Chilling " " is the movie for you . The zombie action is very weak at its best ; the zombies ' primary killing method seems to be grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them to death . The businessman and the security guard do most of the zombie fighting , including a highly suspenseful scene of re-freezing the undead with liquid nitrogen . Let me tell you , the steel mill scene in " " T2 " " has got nothing on " " The Chilling " " in portraying an enemy getting frozen in his tracks like that.How Linda Blair ended up stuck in the middle of this piece of dreck is indeed a mystery . True , her career didn 't exactly skyrocket during the 80s ( sadly ) , but this movie is an embarrassment for her . The script doesn 't even have the decency to put her to any good use . The most that her character is given to do is shriek out things like " " Here they come " , " " " Do something " , " " " Hurry ! " . " The only thing I can figure is that poor Linda was compensated for her work on this film in rations of food . The hero is played by Grizzly Adams himself , Dan Haggerty . In this picture , he faces stiff acting competition from his beard and the security dog , and he does his best to outperform them both.The only frightening part of " " The Chilling " " is the introduction which brings up the factual elements of cryogenics and suggests that " " the film you are about to see could happen in your own community " . " As I was counting the number of times a few of the names are repeated in the closing credits , I was floored to suddenly see Lucasfilm get credited . Fortunately , it was only for the movie 's sound production . 1 / 10 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I really wanted to be able to give this film a 10 . I 've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman films to date ( and maybe it still will be--I have yet to watch the Schumacher films again ) . I 'm also starting to become concerned about whether I 'm somehow subconsciously being contrarian . You see , I always liked the Schumacher films . As far as I can remember , they were either 9s or 10s to me . But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton directed films are far superior . I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time around--I ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as I might , I just couldn 't help feel that Batman Returns just has too many small direction , plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.But Burton _ almost _ trumps the problems with sheer force of style , and even though there are a lot of small flaws , Batman Returns is still a great film , especially if you 're a Burton fan , as Batman Returns has just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas ( 1993 ) and Edward Scissorhands ( 1990 ) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe.The film begins strongly , with the Cobblepots having a baby . We see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces , ready to vomit . Later , they have the baby in a small cage . Finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the Gotham City River . The baby ends up becoming Batman villain The Penguin ( Danny DeVito ) .Meanwhile , Max Shreck ( Christopher Walken ) is the film 's " " evil capitalist " , " comparable to Grissom ( Jack Palance ) in Batman . He is planning on duping Gotham City in various ways , and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary , the timid Selina Kyle ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) . When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots , Grissom tries to get rid of her , but she is rescued by cats , becoming Catwoman.While all of this is going on , The Penguin , who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous , begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy , despite having less than benevolent , ulterior motives.Before re-watching Burton 's Batman films this time , I didn 't remember just how little the films are about Batman ( Michael Keaton ) . It 's almost as if Burton didn 't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on . The focus here is much more on the villains , especially The Penguin . Batman doesn 't appear very often , especially in the beginning of the film , and surprisingly often , we 're watching him watching The Penguin.Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw , I can 't say that I do , even if I 'd like to know more about Batman and follow his story more . The villains ' stories are interesting , too , and as an " " origin story " " for two major Batman villains , Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot.However , there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw . The Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding , but even though they 're frequently on screen , we never get to learn anything about them . Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in Tod Browning 's Freaks ( 1932 ) available , with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli , but he just doesn 't have the space to use them.For that matter , he hardly has space to explore Catwoman . The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as The Penguin , but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long . So the bulk of the Catwoman scenes had to be excised . Of course , all of this barely leaves any room for Batman . Burton has Batman turn very dark in the public 's eye in this film , and unusually , he never bothers to resolve this . As far as we know , at the end , Gothamites still think that Batman is a murdering lunatic . That 's an interesting development , but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.As for the script , although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions ( in terms of logic ) made by characters , it 's clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story . A lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented , but often this is fairly subtle and / or complex ( of course , sometimes it is very blatant or transparent , too ) . It helps to look at Batman Returns as a more " " poetic " " film , as I believe was the intention . This also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions , including from minor characters , are done in service of a general mood or style , and that style works very well . " " Dark " " is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in a word , and whether that 's a positive or negative depends on your disposition . Anyone who knows me knows that I love dark . So for me , Burton 's style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script . In many ways , Batman Returns is like an insane , campy horror film , with beautifully eerie production design . Like Batman , Burton is still making many references to other films , but instead of Vertigo ( 1958 ) and Star Wars ( 1977 ) ( well , there 's still a slight Star Wars reference ) , he invokes films like Nosferatu ( 1922 ) ( including that " " Max Schreck " " was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there ) , Motel Hell ( 1980 ) , the aforementioned Freaks , Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory ( 1971 ) ( which has a surreal , dark edge to it ) and zombie films--made most explicit in The Penguin 's final scene.In terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general " " feel " " of the story , the characters and so on--this couldn 't be a stronger 10 . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" " " Sir " " John Gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one . ; This is one of those films , I suppose , that is considered " " art , " " but don 't be fooled ..... it 's garbage .

Wow , this is heady stuff and real " " art , " " ain 't it ? ? That 's just one example .

Apparently I am swimming against the tide of the glowing comments on this film . I have not seen it since I was 4 or 5 years old but there is one thing I remember distinctly ... The Bunyip was TERRIFYING ! ! ! Nightmare inducing terrifying . With the creepy music and the little girl and kangaroo running / hopping away for their lives ... As a kid I also remember the animated Hobbit ... no worries . Watership down ? Didn 't blink an eye . Dot and the Kangaroo ? It still haunts my dreams . And I have several friends the same age who also think it was massively creepy . Maybe we can get a group rate on therapy.In short : one freaky film for its time . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The core issues at play ( God & Satan / Good & Evil ) can be & should be tremendously compelling ( as demonstrated through thousands of works of art / music / literature / film ) . End of Days , unfortunately , is nothing but a 2Dimensional Cartoon . Byrne 's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to Arnold 's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes.The single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the Gabriel Byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife ? girlfriend ?

" I don 't think this movie had the effect on me that was intended : seeing American soldiers shooting wounded soldiers from the other side , and punching wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them into making them talk made me root for the other side .

It 's so strange that so many people dislike this movie , I really enjoyed it .

" Up until the last few minutes of the movie , I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars . However , the ending is so terrible and " " Hollywoodized " " that it completely undermines the first 80 % of the movie.The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles . The Captain , Gene Hackman , is all for launching , while his first officer , Denzel Washington , is in favor of confirming the launch orders first . The problem is , to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys . Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub . Eventually , the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched . Cool . However , here comes the part that just doesn 't ring true . After they are back on land and go before a review board , Washington and Hackman ( who 'd just spent half the movie trying to kill each other ) shake hands and are all buddy buddy ! Huh ? ! Too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

SOSN is shallow and superficial.Almost all the characters are middle class and English.The gay men are depicted as fickle sexual predators aiming to use children in their empty lives.This film could only appeal to people who know hampstead heath and would get minor satisfaction from pointing out any landmarks.There is no time to engage with the characters and has a result you really don , t care about them , Catherine Tate at the height of her comedic fame stars as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on screen for about the same time as her Nana sketches failed to convince , however if she had said " " what a f * * * * * * liberty " " i would have agreed I 'd rather take a walk in the Park ; unintelligent rubbish ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie is absolutely horrible ! I thought because it had good actors in it like Gabrielle Union , Hill Harper , and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams . The movie is long , and drags on with a documentary style of showing Gabrielle Union , who has died in the movie , talking about her family ; which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who 's who , and who 's related to who . I would not recommend this movie to anyone , and I wish I could take it back where I got it from . I fell asleep from time to time because of the boredom .

" ( Review in English , since Swedish is not allowed ) I saw this movie with extremely low expectations , and I can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them.As much as I loved to see Janne " " Loffe " " Karlsson on the big screen again , the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water , isn 't original or funny . The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable , the ones that ain 't , is just plain boring . I smiled like three times during the entire film.The placement of Swedish Findus products is ( unintentionally ) funny , why not just a big sign saying ; " " Findus made it happen ! " .

" I really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star , because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it 's almost worth the price of the rental . The acting , if you want to call it that , is so stilted and contrived that it makes Ed Wood 's actors appear life like . " " Sammy , " " the lone black character , must be Mimi 's husband in real life because he appears in her other films , but he has zero acting ability . His lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery , though I suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character .

" I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo . Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie , not just a bit part , made me happy.Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn 't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired , but Arnold is an excellent actor , I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired.I love Arnold Vosloo , and he made the film viewable . Otherwise , I would have written it off as another lousy film.I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary , but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good . But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad . There are some glitches in the film ( continuity ) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film.All in all I enjoyed the film , because Arnold Vosloo was in it.Jackie , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth . Sadly , though , after priming us with this , the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on Christianity , and pretty much focusing on the easy targets.The writer / director clearly has some issues with the Church ( he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger ) and this film seems to be his form of release . It 'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded , but as a whole , the movie is disappointing . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" They say David Duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie . That sounds about right.This movie is one of the worst films I 've ever seen and I 've seen Gigli . It 's not as bad as Gigli , but that 's like saying Saddam Hussein wasn 't as bad as Adolf Hitler.Tom Warshaw has been living in France with his French wife and 13-year old son . He has been pretending to be French all this time . He reveals to his wife that he is actually American . For some reason , this comes as an earth-shattering reveal for her , despite the fact that she always commented on her husband 's American accent . Also , their son - remember , he was born in France and never knew his father was American - speaks perfect American English without a hint of French accent . That 's just one of several huge plot holes in this movie.The main bulk of the movie is a flashback to Tommy 's youth in New York City during the 1970 's , as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in France . His best friend as a boy was Pappas , a retarded adult played terribly by Robin Williams . I assume Duchovny thinks that " " retarded " " is someone who is just sort of dumb , because Pappas comes off only mildly slow at times , while other times he comes off as just Robin Williams . Yes , Williams actually fits in his tired improv schtick although he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slow.Tommy 's mother , played by Duchovny 's wife Tea Leoni , is a pill-popping nurse who is distraught over the recent death of her husband . Leoni does a good job , but she mainly just smokes a lot and yells at Tommy for things that don 't seem to be too important . The script didn 't give her much to work with . Tommy also befriends a lady ( whom he calls " " Lady " " ) who is in prison and offers him advice through her jail window ( this house of detention is called " " House of D " " for short , thus the title ) . Tommy has no qualms yelling his personal problems out loud on a city street so this incarcerated felon can offer him advice , and he does so many times without care.I don 't want to bore you with the entire summary of the movie , but plot holes are abound in this film that tries way too hard to be touching but comes off as , well , bad . Real bad . Real real bad . Near the end of this train wreck , the script gets cornier and cornier and ends with a laughably crappy ending.Critics tore " " House of D " " apart and rightfully so . I can 't believe some people actually like this movie . It is a painful film to sit through and I felt weak afterwards - not from emotion , but from how terrible it was . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I just got back from the GLBT Film Festival at the AMC Loews 34th in NY . A friend told me about this film . Audience response was very positive ! Lots of good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of realization . Top notch in every area . A movie that makes you think , and then makes you realize how lucky we 'd all be if we could turn back time and live without shame or guilt . I imagine this will come close to , if not win , the audience favorite award ! What was most surprising was the fact the the movie appears to start off as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the very group it started to satirize . There isn 't any mean spirited humor at the expense of one group , just a slow realization that we would all be better off if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started off with . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show ! Well if that idea doesn 't intrigue you , which it shouldn 't , stay away from ringmaster .

I guess jerry springer doesn 't play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show ( yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show ) and he is only known as jerry in the film . The plot ( if you can call it that ) is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mother 's live in boyfriend . So the mother 's brilliant idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as getting it on with her daughter 's boyfriend . ( Is it any coincidence they live in a trailer park ) . Meanwhile somewhere else in america a woman finds her cheatin ' man with her friend in bed together . So of course call america 's therapist Jerry springer !

I was not feeling for any of the characters , the plot was all too predictable ( to the point that I followed it ) and the second leap of time in the storyline made me quit .

" I 'm sorry to say this , but the acting in this film is horrible . The dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever . Perhaps I got the " " dress rehearsal " " version by mistake . The director over-uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves . The story is pretty well written , and the fight sequences are actually better than I have seen in many action films . The fights seem pretty real . But all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point-blank automatic weapon fire , grenades , morter rounds , and bazookas . The enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I have ever seen , especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards , and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet .

Charles Grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters . For another it does not seem to have the same pacing -- it just doesn 't flow well . Everything seems tired and forced . The joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here -- you just want the movie to end .

" I 'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K , so I waited anxiously to see this episode . I 'll comment on the movie first , then the MST3K episode .

If you watched the series and love the league as I do then prepare to be disappointed . I went to the cinema with a group of die-hard league fans and we were all in agreement that this film wasn 't as funny or dark as the three series before . In my personal opinion it was a money spinner . The writing was contrived and the plot confused - no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do . It was self indulgence of the worst kind from writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticisms . I hope the league at least can be honest enough with themselves and acknowledge this film as being inferior to the superb three series .

" Another French film with absurdity . Baise-Moi ( F * ck Me ) tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and f * ck .

They look so comfortable in sex scenes , nonetheless , they can 't make the whole film worth watching as , to me , the film does not require no further ability of acting than that .

This was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot . Seems that the U of O sign was shown . While we were shooting , we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff . Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men I have ever met .

" I was looking forward to seeing John Carpenter 's episode in Season 2 because his first , Cigarette Burns , was by far the best from Season 1 ( and I did like other episodes from that season ) . Oh , how I was disappointed.In fairness to Carpenter I think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing . The characters , aside from the subject matter , seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of Walker , Texas Ranger . The acting was bad , and I normally like Ron Perlman a lot , but I can only blame them so much because the writing was so horrible . I 'm not going to try to guess what the writers were trying to do because that would be useless but it appeared as though they were trying to mix horror ( obviously ) with some form of social commentary on abortion and religion . In this case , not surprisingly , it seemed a chance to bash a certain variety or religious nuts as well as fanatical anti-abortionists . And I am in favor of both aims but it was done so horribly that I was embarrassed to watch characters act and speak with such stupid inconsistency . This failed totally to offer any worthwhile opinion on the subjects and the horror element failed as well alongside such inept writing.While I don 't think Carpenter can be blamed for most of the badness here I will say he did choose to direct the teleplay and therefore has that to be held responsible for . There are a couple small bits that I found nice , hence the 2 stars I gave it.The actual gore and monster effects were good , but the CGI gore ( two separate gunshots to the head ) were so obviously inferior quality CGI they should 've never been given the OK . I 'm generally very critical of CGI but not because I have a problem with it in principle . I have a problem with the execution of it . The technology , while amazing in some respects , is not good enough to match " " real " " effects , whether they be miniatures or gore especially when it is supposed to match something organic and / or alive , and therefore shouldn 't be used until they are . CGI can be used well in small amounts or obviously if the whole film is animated.I 'll also take this opportunity to note that the show title , Masters of Horror , is a bad title to have . There simply aren 't many actual " " masters of horror " " around . Maybe two or three . If the show were called " " Tale of Horror " " or something like that it would be fine . But as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes , and therefore being criticized for not being a " " master of horror " " is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career . And it didn 't even have to be a good one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I enjoy quality crapness , and this ranks up there with some of the finest. the cg is out of this world , or at least pre-dates our world , and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad . I quite enjoyed some of this , but the acting is so goddamn awful , and even the obligatory nude scene doesn 't really have any baps out in it. just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one . I don 't know who wasted more time , me watching this , or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers . I can assure you , it wont . However , on a brighter note , I have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this movie , so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This film had no huge stars in it , but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors AND Gene Tierney before she became a big star . With George Sanders , Reginald Gardner , Harry Carey , Bruce Cabot , Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke , you 'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered . Most of this , I suspect , is because of a second-rate script , as director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm.The film is set in East Africa during WWII--just before the Americans entered the war . The Brits are trying to control their African colonies while subversive Nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals . One of the white men in the film is a double-dealer--working for the destruction of the British Empire ! But , lovely Tierney , playing a sultan 's daughter ( ! ) , is out to help save the day for good ol ' Britain.American film makers have long sided with the Empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro-empire films . Nowadays , with changed sensibilities , the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for Queen and country seems ridiculous--and it would be hard to root for either side ! Still , in its day , this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the British--though when seen today , the film suffers from a long-winded script and silly casting . The one bright moment in the film is the final showdown between George Sanders and the enemy agent . Too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk--losing some of its punch . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The subject this latest adman-turned-movieman tries to tackle in his debut ( ad ) venture is quite an age-old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard -- timeless romance ( pun intended ) .However , the exploration ( and exploitation for Desi auds ) falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to ' pepper , spice and sugar ' up the usual masala mix of b / g score , dialog , dance , drama , etc creates a nice-looking package with not much inside.In the first 40 minutes of the movie , the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8-9 times .

How many 60-somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile 30-something ? ? ? Timeless mind yes , but surely what about the not-so-ageless bod ? And sole ? Sorry , soul ? ! Reasonably good acting by Paresh Rawal who has the only sensible role in the film . The director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new-fangled discovery of a hot new idea . Nowhere are we presented with any real-life problems or issues such a pair might face , other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle . The sub-plot of a little kid with cancer ( the bachelor boy 's first love ) goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girl 's character.Anyway , nice try but not quite there yet . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Canterville Ghost ( 1996 ) .The director made this too sappy a production . Maybe it 's the generation , but I really liked the Charles Laughton version . There is a time and place for " " emoting " " and this production does not translate very well . Patrick Stewart , reciting Shakespeare was very good , but still inappropriate . Would neither recommend nor watch again . The close-ups and padded text and sub-plots were lost on me . Adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work . The screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent , maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue . Check out the really good version and pass on this one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I am not so much like Love Sick as I image . Finally the film express sexual relationship of Alex , kik , Sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness , frustration and jealous , at last , Alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future.Ending up was sad.The director Tudor Giurgiu was in AMC theatre on Sunday 12 : 00PM on 08 / 10 / 06 , with us watched the movie together . After the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicate.On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere , I don 't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie . The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki , and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story.The two main reasons I don 't like this movie are , firstly , the film didn 't told us how they started to fall in love ? Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living , then two girls are fall in love . It doesn 't make sense at all . How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man . Too much fragments , you need to image and connect those stories by your mind . Secondly , The whole film didn 't have a scene of Alex and Kik 's sexual intercourse , that ' s what I was waiting for혚혚 . However , it still had some parts were deserved to recommend . The " " ear piercing " " part was kind of interesting . Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik 's love . That was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love . Also , the scene of they were lying in the soccer field , the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1 . Bad acting , bad characters , annoying clown , bad lines , you name it . Honestly , I 'm not all that surprised that more people haven 't seen this movie . The only reason I watched Killjoy 2 is because I wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes . They didn 't . This movie is just as bad , if not worse , than the first one . That clown .... that goddamn clown .... I hate him ! I hate him so much ! And I don 't hate him because he is a good villain ... I hate him because he is annoying beyond belief ! I hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is unrepairable . The last thing we need is a Killjoy 3 . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" The Soloist has all ingredients to impress the Academy . Its director , Joe Wright , has already authored a best picture candidate . The leading actor , Robert Downey Jr . , starred in a widely praised superhero film . Finally , the movie itself is a drama . When it was mysteriously pulled from release in late 2008 , filmgoers and critics were baffled . Now that I 've seen it , I assure you Universal didn 't just delay this film to promote Iron Man-Oscar buzz . The Soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidates.Downey and co-star Jamie Fox aren 't to be blamed for this mishap . Joe Wright is largely at fault but even he can 't save a Lifetime story . Many movies are too complex and alienate viewers . This one is unusually simple . It 's a movie about a newspaper reporter , Steve Lopez ( Downey ) , who befriends a homeless musician , Nathaniel Ayers ( Jamie Fox ) . That 's it . Ayers is schizophrenic and doesn 't resonate with Lopez 's traditional approach to friendship . The two become friends . They begin this movie as acquaintances and are BFFs by its end . Tension consists of moments like this : will Ayers let Lopez take him to the homeless shelter ? This material would have been better suited as a made-for-TV production rather than a feature film.Wright includes many scenes of cheap humor to obscure the lack of content . Lopez battles yard-defiling raccoons in what I consider a sub-plot . Do you remember when this happened in Atonement or Pride and Prejudice ? Those films were structured enough to permit an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged . Ayers ' back story is fleshed out when it doesn 't need to be . Worst of all , these scenes are not connected and appear at random intervals . It 's a way of admitting that the main story carries little appeal . Nathaniel was a violin prodigy with a tough upbringing ( I was too ) . This is a fabricated attempt to create sympathy with Ayers when most of us already have it . He 's a homeless schizophrenic for crying out loud ! The movie somewhat conveys humanity 's love for music , like Amadeus and Beethoven Lives Upstairs . It isn 't as effective as either of those pictures , however . The entire film is hinged on Ayers ' schizophrenia . It ultimately is how he interacts with everyone else . His being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including . The film doesn 't incorporate this characteristic fully into his persona . Take music out of Amadeus or Beethoven Lives Upstairs , and no film remains . The Soloist is more about friendship in general than music . Nathaniel could be a writer or film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously altered.This is only Joe Wright 's third film , and his first that isn 't a romance staring Keira Knightley . Let 's hope this film isn 't an indication of how limited his abilities are . There are stylistic nods to his earlier works but The Soloist is much weaker than either of them . In his defense , Universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture . This film seems tailored for Imagine Entertainment ( distributors of Changeling ) . I wouldn 't be so disappointed with it if had a limited release . Its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Jerry Angell , owner of zombie-horror 's finest mullet , returns for more undead action in the sequel to director Todd Sheets ' atrocious home-made gore-fest Zombie Bloodbath . This time around , Jerry plays a sleazy low-life thug who , along with his equally despicable partner-in-crime , some escaped convicts , several teenagers , and a bunch of screaming girls , comes face-to-face with a horde of shambling , flesh-eating corpses.Obviously having learnt zilch about improving his craft in the two years since Zombie Bloodbath , Sheets delivers another shoddy mess of a film that somehow manages to be even worse than the original혰a feat that I thought was almost impossible to achieve . The acting is uniformly lousy , the effects amateurish and cheap ( most of the gore appears to be nothing more than a selection of offcuts , offal and blood from the local butcher 's shop ) , the story incomprehensible ( as far as I could fathom , the zombies rise from the dead because a scarecrow commands them to ! ! ! ) , and the direction frustratingly laden with cheap looking video effects and completely meaningless cuts to black-and-white.And as if that wasn 't enough to convince you of this film 's complete lack of redeeming features , the simply mind-bogglingly moronic ending should do the trick : the few remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently happens to have a stash of flesh-eating bacteria laying on its passenger seat혰just the thing for dissolving the undead ( but , strangely enough , not at all detrimental to the living ) . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie . In fact I could not even finish it . I want my money back . One more of Hollywood 's feeble attempts to come up with a new idea . Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge . Just in case . They should of gave Nic Cage a hat and a bull-whip . Swashbucklin ' . Cage 's performance in Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas beats this " " lemon " . " People who are completely and totally marketed ( and most of them are ) should love this movie . If this film had been animated , I would have taken it more seriously . I would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it . In my opinion , this was a incredibly stupid movie and it made a even more incredibly sad attempt to try and hide that FACT.All the SHEEP seem to love it though . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is almost certainly the worst Western I 've ever seen . The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family / friends have been murdered , so hero sets out to exact revenge , foils the ineffective lawman , rescues the kidnapped loving damsel , and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel . This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn 't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you 'll ever see . The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting ; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth , maturity , and realism . The sound is bad ; it sometimes looks dubbed . The cinematography is lame , and the sets are sometimes just facades . The acting is pitiful ; sure , some of the performers could blame the script , but others cannot use that excuse . I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again ; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean , he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho . And speaking of Chris Lybbert , who plays Hopalong , check out his duds ( if you dare to watch this film ) : He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working , down-and-dirty cowboy . If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy , then get this , but if you have more than two neurons , watch something else . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've noticed that a lot of people are taking Opera to task for the way Betty reacts to the murders . I think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine a " " normal " " person would react . The thing is ... Betty is not a " " normal " " person , due to traumatic events in her childhood . She has problems way way before the movie ever even starts ... and by the end of Opera ... in my opinion ... she has become totally unhinged.---------------------SPOILERS--------------------------------------- You have to keep in mind that when she was a very small child she witnessed her mother 's lover commit at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochist mother was getting off watching it.She was raised by a woman who achieves sexual release tied up watching girls get hacked , slashed , and strangled to death . That does not make for a healthy home life . I think it 's pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have employed all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never snitched on her . It is also likely that at her impressionable age , Betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw . Is this just something that adults do , etc.Betty obviously looks up to her mother ... I mean ... she 's become an opera singer just like her . If mommy likes it it can 't be bad , can it ... mommy can 't be bad , can she ? She couldn 't tell the police on her mommy or this mysterious hooded fellow she associates with mommy.Betty has a lot of deep-seated emotional issues . Her mind has for years been trying to block out the memory of what she saw her mother doing ... but it keeps coming to the surface , manifesting itself in the form of horrible nightmares , skull-throbbing migraines , a dependence on relaxation techniques , and sexual frigidity She associates brutal violence / bloody death with sex on a subconscious level . There 's an inner struggle between the part of Betty that has confused murder / sex and the part of her which believes these things to be wrong.After she 's seen her boyfriend murdered by the hooded man ... she calls the police , yet is unwilling to give her name . The part of her that thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call , but the part that is ambivalent won 't allow her to admit personal involvement . The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way . So she walks away from the phone in the rain ... and when she 's picked up by the director she 's acting surprisingly calm , not as upset as you would think a " " normal " " person would be ... because the part of her that 's been blocking stuff since she was a child is trying its damnedest to block the horror of what she 's just witnessed.The state of affairs in her life all contribute to an impasse within Betty 's psyche . Her singing career is starting to bear fruit ... she 's going to be a great opera singer like her mother was . But is she going to become like her mother in all ways ? In the darker ways ? Or will she be able to make her own path ? Add this to the re-emergence of the hooded man murdering everyone around her.It 's not until the hooded man kills Daria Nicolodi 's character that Betty really takes an active role in defeating the killer . Here 's someone who loves Betty , who 's supported her wholeheartedly in her emerging career , who is in fact a maternal figure in Betty 's life now since mommy 's dead . Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then to see the woman who is the closest thing you have to a mother get shot through the eyeball.I could go on ... but I won 't . The main gist of what I 'm saying is that the character of Betty is a lot more complex than most of the reviewers on here have been willing to acknowledge.Opera is one of Argento 's best ... and not just for the visuals alone ( although they are truly magnificent ) and not just for the inventive murders ( although they are ) . There is a depth here ... and attention needs to be paid . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" To say this film stinks would be insulting to skunks . As the other commenter says , this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 ( it is especially , incredibly insulting to gays ) . It is awful - and not in a " " so bad it 's funny " " sort of way either - it 's just plain awful . No , I have to say it : IT STINKS ! ( sorry skunks ) .From the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for . The " " plot " " is incoherent , the characterization non-existent , the acting is of the over the top mugging " " look at me I 'm being funny ! " " school and so it goes on . The set pieces are clumsily set up ( if at all ) and are badly executed , it 's just awful on every front - apart from the music maybe , I don 't remember thinking the music stinks ( apart from the songs ) .To be fair to the makers , they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly : the opening credits include the title " " Also starring Ertha Kitt as the voice of Betty the meteor " " ( since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional purring noise they may well have lifted Ms. Kitt 's contribution from one of her records ) and the second line of the movie runs something like : " ... " and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus . " " Uranus - " " Your Anus " " geddit ? geddit ? huh ? huh ? ? Your Anus ? The humour really is that cheap.It says strange things about the " " comedies " " of that period in that it was perfectly permissable for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say " " sh * t " " out loud.I paid fifty pence ( about $ 1.00 ) for this movie in a sale .

" To keep from being bored during " " Love and Sex , " " first I tried to think of all the movies this was imitative of : " " Breaking Up " " with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek ( though that had a more original ending ) , " " About Last Night " " with Rob Lowe , and a lot of TV shows . Second was admiring just how gorgeous Framke Janssen is so I couldn 't believe for a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date . She is certainly in line to give Julia Roberts a run for her money , literally-- and wasn 't Julia in some movie with this same plot or other ? Third was trying to figure out why the writer / director bothered to give Jon Favreau 's character the Jewish name of Adam Levy ; he even refers admiringly to eating a ham sandwich.Fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review which is why I was in the theater .

" Spheeris used this documentary to push a stereotype of punks . This documentary is biased and guided , not objective . The cutting techniques that jump from interview to interview may be used to take the spoken word of interviewees out of context . When you watch the film , the sticking idea that comes from the interviews of the punks is that they are pretty dumb . Band members and other punks seem to be of low intelligence and unable to explain their motives or give detailed or coherent answers or even answers at all . I highly doubt that if some of those who were interviewed knew what Spheeris was creating or saw the final product would allow themselves to be included in the project . This film puts punks in a bad light by making them seem unintelligent and simple-minded . Spheeris ' film should not be taken as a representation of the L.A. punk scene .

" Spoilers Well , the one line summary says it all . Melville쨈s " " Le samurai " " is the original and there are elements of " " Leon " . " And they are better - much better ! In the " " Samurai " " Alain Delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs ( with so much suspense in these scenes ! ) . Even the end is exactly the same : the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand . The world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it.Delon is not killing so many people like the Ghost dog . But I guess Jarmusch liked " " Leon " " very much or even " " Desperado " " by Rodriguez . So he added this , too . And let me guess : the girl will become a professional like Ghost dog ( like Natalie Portman in " " Leon " " ) ? So what was Jarmusch thinking after all ?

" I saw the original " " Chorus Line " " on Broadway God knows how many times and felt the passion , despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater . Michael Bennett knew he would have to re-imagine " " Chorus " " for the screen but could never figure out how to do it . If the man who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question . There are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience . However , Richard Attenborough fresh of the musical work of " " Ghandi " " and dancing with animals in " " Doctor Doolittle " " ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show . Horrible songs were added ( Surprise ! Surprise ! ) , great songs were dropped or given to other characters ( which didn 't make sense ) . Michael Douglas was mis-cast . People that couldn 't dance tried to act and there was the sexy " " Landers " " woman who couldn 't sing , act , or dance - I guess she had just finished being Ghandi 's wife . The dances by Jeffrey Hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from " " Flashdance " " rejects and nothing works . I sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing . If you truly love this show and it is coming back to Broadway in 2006 - see it but don 't think that the long running musical event that was " " A Chorus Line " " has any thing at all to do with this film . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I ticked the " " contains spoiler " " box , in case I say anything that is a spoiler and don 't realise I 've said it until I re-read it after I 've posted . So it 's just in case.Anyhow , back to reviewing this film.I saw this film on skymovies earlier on this afternoon , and by the description Sky gives you ( these people must be on acid ) it sounded pretty good , but then when I actually got about 30 minutes into it , I was appalled . This film , in my opinion , has the worst scriptwriting and actors / actresses - ever . The young girl who falls in love with the boy from L.A after about 3 hours , is a really stupid , lame character , who has an annoying , whiney voice , and boff hair . -.- . Then there 's her lover , who 's an idiot , and is also very whiney . Actually , maybe they suit each other . Then there 's the boy 's mum , who 's with him on holiday , and surprise , surprise - she 's a doctor , and - oh my god , wait , there 's even more unsuspected surprises ! A virus suddenly breaks out on the island and she knows all about viruses ! = O. SHOCK HORROR ! Yeah , right . Lol . Then there 's this insane religious lad , who keeps going on about " " ' erbs " " or something , and how the Lord knows all . Everyone on the island seems to love him , yet he 's actually a stubborn , arrogant , steroid-pumped ( you really need to watch this film just for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a swim , his head is like tiny , and his body is MASSIVE. it 's hilarious ) buffoon who 's had way too much to drink.Anyhow , after all these weirdo characters , including a stoned-looking taxi driver , the religious lad finally gives in to the doctor , and she takes a blood sample , and they get straight to work on finding the cure from that , because for some reason he 's dramatically been saved , all down to " " ' erbs and God " . " AND OH MY GOD . YES , THERE 'S ANOTHER Surprise ! ! YOU 'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT ! ! Just in the nick of time , with 11 minutes to go before everybody on the island drops dead in-fact , including her son and his girl , she finds the cure , and injects everybody , and it 's all resolved ! ! ! What a pathetic film . I mean , I knew it sounded an obvious ending from when I first started watching it , but I actually though it 'd be good and have some sub-plot twists somewhere , but no-no , it was just boring and dry.Don 't watch this film . You 'll end up like me - stunned for 3 hours and then demanding the hour and a half you spent of your life watching it back . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie was so bad it was laughable . I couldn 't resist watching it though . The plot is standard , the acting quite horrible ( supporting cast such as the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors ) . Kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic plot.The headliner who plays " " Kathy " " was just fascinating because I couldn 't decide if her deadpan , flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting ( I decided it was both ) . This leaves the script to comment on , which was pretty awful . Pat remarks , idiotic decisions , and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie . Maybe this is what was so riveting ; I don 't know . I just watched it to see how bad it could be . ( Actually the dialog doesn 't even qualify to be called " " cliche ' " " - but it 's almost completely inane . ) All in all , very bad , cheaply made movie . The sets , the same scenes ( a house , a building ) were shown over and over with no artistry or actual tie-in to the action ; more like props that were randomly dropped into the action in a bad play . A chase scene could have been shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school : poorly shot , cheap props , minimal action .... and I still wanted to see the ending .

" I absolutely despise this movie . No wonder Jose Larraz " " disowned " " it at one point and refuses to discuss it . I admire Larraz 's work , especially his more obscure slasher / sex maniac thrillers like SAVAGE LUST or SCREAM AND DIE . His work has a kind of inescapable artiness about it that he can 't seem to switch off , owing in part to his secondary career as a painter & cartoonist . It 's too bad he never made a Western , his vision would have been perfect.BLACK CANDLES is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece VAMPYRES . And it 's notoriety revolves around one scene where a Satanic coven enacts a bizarre rite involving extracting the reproductive fluid of a goat -- symbolizing The Beast -- as some kind of nauseating balm to be used in preparing the waif like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of Satan . The scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any plumbing apparatus the goat may have been endowed with , relying upon the histrionics of the actress recruited to play the supplicant in the ritual and lots of guttural chanting on the film 's recycled musical score heard in a half-dozen films attributed to Jacinto Molina . The perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail , heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teen-aged daughter of the Satanic priest . My but they had fun concocting this movie.The problem with it is that there isn 't much to deconstruct or contemplate aside from the paper thin ROSEMARY 'S BABY derived story of a woman being weaned into her role as Satan 's bride by a sophisticated coven of Satanists living in the hedgrowed outlands of a very sinister Britain . Led by Eurohorror sensation Helga Line these Satanists are comprised of doctors , lawyers , land owning magnates and other upper crust dignitaries who actually owe their professional success to their worship of the devil . All you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours , only watch out whom you may sell out to pay back petty personal conflict or you may end up being felched with a sword.The film attempts to combine this heady Satanic trip with oodles or borderline graphic sex , and should correctly be regarded as a kind of apex or culmination of the sex and horror Spanish thriller traditions popularized in part by Mr. Molina & Ms. Line , and which had amazingly flourished under the disapproving eye of one Generalissimo Franco , the dictator who controlled Spain up until 1976 . While he lived his decree was that Spanish cinema was to be free of graphic depictions of on-screen sex . Spanish directors often made two versions of their films , one with the sex concealed for their own screens and one with the fornication on display for export . As difficult as it was for the filmmakers to express themselves the result was a sort of interesting tension that usually results when artists flirt with the forbidden : Spanish horror from the 1970s has a very special flavor to it that is somewhat of an acquired taste . It 's not for everyone.But in a bizarre turn of events , without Franco 's influence on their culture Spanish horror sort of dried up in the late 1970s , when their Gothic castles and demonic orgies suddenly found themselves pass챕 when compared to new sensations like JAWS and the STAR WARS phenomenon . And without Franco 's constraints their were suddenly a flood of overtly graphic thrillers that came tumbling out of the pipes in the very late 70s / early 80s , of which BLACK CANDLES is perhaps the best known due to it 's emphasis on sexual deviancy with a barnyard animal . Larraz ' major horror films have always revolved around sexual taboos ( the lesbianism of VAMPYRES , the incest of SCREAM AND DIE & DEVIATION ) but here the effect of the depravity is to overshadow the rest of the production . Nobody cares about anything else but the traditionally censored trip to the Goat Barn , and watching a cut version without the scene in the barn is almost an exercise in pointlessness . The sex isn 't graphic enough to rate as porn and the chills aren 't chilling enough to rate as horror.So , BLACK CANDLES is essentially a behavior study -- Here is how high society British Satanists might behave in their secluded mansions out in the West Midlands or whatever . Between sex scenes the actors / actresses sit around and have lots of discussions . The best thing the film has going for it is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere of claustrophobia , with most of it 's action taking place in the tightly confined interiors of Ms. Line 's character 's mansion . Nearly every avenue of fornication is hinted at so fans of soft-core sex romps with a hinting of supernatural horror will be amused , and of course the vicarious sex criminals amongst us will enjoy choking their chickens to the goat barn scene . But the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly , pretentious , intelligence insulting , and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze.2 / 10 ; Without the Goat Barn this movie just isn 't the same , and with the scene it 's probably a bit too much for most viewers . Larraz was correct to disown it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Maybe I 'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours . Even though I loved " " American Beauty " , " but that was it . I just want my 2 hours back . It was a big waste of my time .

This has to be one of the biggest misfires ever ... the script was nice and could have ended a lot better.the actors should have played better and maybe then i would have given this movie a slightly better grade. maybe Hollywood should remake this movie with some little better actors and better director.sorry guys for disappointment but the movie is bad.If i had to re-watch it it would be like torture . I don 't want to spoil everyone 's opinion with mine so .. my advice is watch the movie first .. see if u like it and after vote ( do not vote before you watch it ! ) and by the way ... Have fun watching it ! Don 't just peek ... watch it ' till the end : ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ! ! , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If I could give it less that 1 I would . Do not bother to rent ; if someone gives you the DVD burn it.This is horrible movie making . A total waste of even digital " " film " . " I have seen better on Youtube made by 12 year old boys . Lommel claims to have written this , if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages . The story line is none existent , the dialog is mainly screaming , the camera work is some sort of attempted arty flairs with nonsensical cutting of totally unrelated jumps to either industrial transportation scenes or some sort of odd angry young woman rift.I can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a " " creative " " film - I like David Lynch.This one is either so far beyond my limited powers of comprehension I missed it or it is totally pointless . I think this is a " " lets see if we can grab a title that will be coming out soon and do a weird rift on it and see if we can grab some of the bucks " " con job.I cannot see why Lionsgate even bothered with this . Totally worthless , it is so bad I will not rent any other by this same director . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Astounding that something like this could find its way to be viewed by the public . I knew it was by Uwe Boll , & I found it in the bargain bin at a store for $ 2 ( still pretty steep , considering ) but morbid curiosity led me to view this , and : 1 ) . I am fairly sure this is a rip-off of Seven , Silence of the Lambs , and American Psycho , all rolled into one , with dialog that may have been written by preteens.2 ) . Casper Van Dien plays the main character , and he 's so absolutely bizarre and creepy that just about anyone would KNOW he must be the crazed serial killer.3 ) . Jennifer Rubin plays the " " good cop " " that invites a serial killer to her apartment for a home cooked dinner , and what does she get for her trouble ? I 'll let you guess.4 ) . Michael Pare plays an " " intense " " cop , who drives a VW Bug , new-style , that is , with a siren on it . A VW Bug ... that 'll strike fear into criminal 's hearts when they see THAT coming.5 ) . Van Dien breaks up with his fianc챕 , but she still has an " " not engaged " " party , complete with " " not a wedding cake " . " Imagine everyone 's surprise he shows up ( he was , of course , invited ) and they all get shot.6 ) . Actually , this should have been # 1 , really . The killer in this is known as " " The Monkey Maker " . " This is , without a doubt , the stupidest killer name anyone could have come up with in a million years . Presumably it has something to do with the " " see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil " " saying , complete with monkeys . It 's possible that monkeys had something to do with the script , too.7 ) . Oh yeah , and there 's a club that Van Dien visits near the beginning of the film . There 's bad disco music , I mean , really bad , and a chain-link fenced cage with , uh , gang members beating the crap out of each other with baseball bats ? That 's what it looked like . And of course , this is only the tip of the iceberg , the really cool stuff ( ? ! ) goes on in the basement , where some questionable " " actor " " talks some woman into signing a confession before she gets shot , this being , I guess , a snuff movie ? Not quite sure how this fits in with the rest of the film , and Boll probably wasn 't either , so if he wasn 't worried , then I won 't worry.An incredible piece of non-entertainment that will make you feel like you 're watching something from a parallel universe . A parallel universe that 's KIND of like ours , but where things are just enough off where they don 't seem right . You have entered " " The Boll Zone " .

" Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and no one can play Woodroe F. Call better than he . Not only was he the first and best , he was the only person that could portray his grief and confusion . It was a bad let-down and I 'm surprised I even made myself watch it . I can even begin how how pitiful they made Woodroe . I understand he would be old by that time , but everyone knows that he would NEVER let that pull him down . The first movie was the best and the only one that I 'll ever watch . I hope to God that no more directors plan on continuing or remaking the wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval . Without them , the movies are pointless wastes of time and money for everyone , including the director . IF YOU PLAN ON MAKING ANOTHER LONESOME DOVE MOVIE OF ANY KIND , take mine and billions of others , don 't waste time . Continuing the movies is just grinding the first one into the ground .

" So , this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see . It 's up there with " " Crossbones " " and " " Southern Comfort " , " but if your a bad movie fan like I am , this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you 've had in years . WHY does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms ? WHY does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag ? And who is he anyway ? WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after they die ? What is this ? Highlander ? Dracula McCloud ? Who cares ! Just laugh at it . This movie has no continuity , no plot , no anything , really . Ron Hall 's range of emotions are always off . He looks happy when he should be sad , angry when he should be confused . The rest of the cast couldn 't act their way out of a paper bag . The special ( " " Short bus " " kinda special ) effects are randomly placed , and never needed . Most scenes are lit with a desk lamp , if they are lit at all . Mel Novak has the AUDACITY to look off-camera for his line , and it 's not even edited out . They just keep on filming . In fact , half of this movie isn 't even on film at all . It 's 1 / 2 film , 1 / 2 sony hand-cam . For most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home . This movie doesn 't just have a few plot holes , it 's a mine field of confusion and mental pain ! But OH do I love it ! Thank you Ron Hall , for this cinematic abomination . I went out and bought it , cause it 's just so damn funny . ( $ 1.99 on Amazon , and I had it rush delivered ! ) " " I have weapons ! I have weapons ! I have WEAPONS !

" The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie from 1933 , a cutting edge film for it 's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible . Go ahead , take a look at the film , you will be shocked that it was made in 1933 , it was the first true special effects movie . Come 2000 , computer aided special effects seem like child 's play , audiences are not blown away by special effects , instead they are disappointed if they are not done right . The special effects in Hollow Man , the update of the HG Wells story , are OK , but not the biggest problem with this film directed by Paul Verhoeven , who you might remember from Showgirls and Total Recall . Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine , a scientist dabbling in the world of bio-invisibilation ( yeah , I know that 's not a word ) but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team 's funding . So , as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do , he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation ( yeah , I know , I used that non-word again ) process . The process has dire consequences , no Caine does not die , but instead becomes a horny , violent creature , aka a guy . Now that he 's invisible , Caine stalks a sexy neighbor , a co-worker , former girlfriend Linda ( Elisabeth Shue ) , and the man who took away his funding . Then a funny thing happens , Caine becomes a new supernatural being , " " The Thing That Won 't Die . " " Laughing in the face of all things natural , Caine faces down death and spits in it 's face , as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die , dragging the ending of the movie out . The movie is silly , stupid , and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used , sometimes not . There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man , but of course , not one of them is explored . For a more interesting look at an invisible being , get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema , and check out the 1933 Invisible Man . Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you come back , probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" From around the time Europe began fighting World War II , until the war 's end , Hollywood ( with significant prodding from the government ) made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the Army , by making the life of a serviceman appear " " cool . " " This is by far the sloppiest , implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work , you get the best food , and you get to lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio . I am far too young to have participated in WWII , but I think that there was more to it than that . There is the barest cat 's whisker of a plot , and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day 's leading acts.I think that by 1943 , even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie . While I am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment , I can 't help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war , were amused or repulsed by this trivialization of their loved ones ' sacrifice . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I missed the beginning of this film , which might account for why I disliked it so much . On the other hand I 've studied the fall of the Roman republic for years so I know the story . Then again , that might also be the reason why I disliked this film.The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras . Though it 's so inaccurate that I don 't think they made an attempt for it to be correct , in which case it can be forgiven . The odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing . Like throwing in Antonius ' marriage to Octavia , and then pushing it aside two scenes later . Why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and Octavia is never even seen ? And like calling Antonius by his actual name ( Marcus Antonius ) in some scenes , and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes.Though historical inaccuracies aside , the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn 't for the leading lady . There isn 't an ounce of dignity in her . She 's hysterical , dramatical , and completely lacking control of herself . Instead of being a clever and composed queen Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of PMS . 95 % of that comes from the poor acting , but 5 % is also from poor script writing . Far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script . Sometimes you weren 't watching Antonius and Cleopatra , you were watching immature versions of Dawson and Joey from " " Dawson 's Creek " . " If you want to watch something about this period , watch ... anything but this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I tuned into this movie not because I am a fan of U.S. High School basketball ( in fact I only rarely watch NBA games ) but rather because I am a fan of Gene Hackman , who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances . In this case , however , I was sorely disappointed . This was not one of the bright shining stars of Hackman 's career.In fairness to him , he didn 't have a lot to work with . As Norman Dale , the new coach of a small town high school basketball team in Indiana , he wasn 't called on to do much acting . Basically his performance consisted of pacing up and down basketball sidelines ranting at the referees . I didn 't find him particularly believable in the role to be honest . I also was unimpressed with the requisite romance between Dale and Myra Fleener ( Barbara Hershey ) . Quite honestly there was absolutely no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey . The romance never captured my attention , and neither did the basketball " " action , " " which was altogether too predictable.There were far too many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile . I never did understand the depth of the sheer hatred that so many of the townsfolk had for Dale , almost from before the time he arrived . The character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed . Too much basketball and not enough human interaction , in my opinion . How many shots of kids shooting baskets do we need to see to get the point that this is a basketball movie ? There was no suspense : is it even possible to doubt that Hickory is going to win the big one ? I realize that this is based on a true story , but I guess it proves that not every true story should be a movie . Quite frankly , it just wasn 't a very interesting movie . Definitely a movie Gene Hackman would like to forget.No better than a 2 / 10 in my opinion . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The first Cruel Intentions , the original , is my favorite movie of all time . It was an absolute masterpiece . So how on earth could they make a sequel so downright bad . Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie . In this one , Amy Adams sucks . She is terrible . And couldn 't they have found a chick who actually looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar ? At least the same hair color ! ! ! i mean come on . Robin Dunn isn 't as bad as Adams , but he is absolutely terrible when compared to Ryan Phillipe . The Sebastian in the first film is devious , deceitful , and much more evil than the Sebastian in the prequel . And what is up with the story line . It basically goes like this ... 1- Sebastian has a bad rep at his first school , so the movie says , although it mentions nothing about him and his dating life , and how he has been with girls 2- Sebastian moves to New York , and just suddenly decides he 's going to turn himself around . He " " falls in love " " with Danielle ( might i remind you that in the original , Sarah Michelle giller says quote " " you broke up with THE FIRST PERSON you ever loved because i said to- so how can he have been in love in the prequel ? ? ? ) . And he 's all nice and charming , and all " " good person " , " as he turns down sex from the chick his dad was doing.3- He does a complete 180 , and ends up in a threesome at the end of the movie , and then seducing Cherry.I mean , its terrible . And i loved the first one so much . I haven 't even seen the third one yet . I hope to god its better than this prequel . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I think that can sum up this show about as well as anything . Batman TAS may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet . It 's just too damn good . Was Batman Beyond good ? " " Yeah , but it was no TAS . " " Is Justice League good ? " " It 's not too bad , but it 's no TAS . " " The Batman is certainly no TAS , either , but I won 't hold that against it . It would be unfair and besides , it has plenty of other problems with it.The concept of a younger , less experienced Batman fighting crime is a fine one , and at times the art is very nice . But all of the rest of the time , the art is worthless Americanime , and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself . It is paced , written , and designed like an Americanime . If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures , I 'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures . Or I could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect . The Joker is a homicidal , mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits , unpredictability , and clever gadgets to fight Batman . When he is forced to fight hand to hand , he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched . He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung-fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air , accompanied by speed lines . If they had wanted to do that with a villain , there were other less important characters they could have used or * gasp * they could have created a new one entirely . And it 's not that re-imaginings are a bad thing , don 't get me wrong . TAS ( there I go again ) took Mr. Freeze from your standard icegun-wielding B villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character . Of course Freeze wasn 't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade , but the point stands . What The Batman does is it takes everything you liked about Batman comics and lore and takes a large , smelly dump on them . Guess what ? They were eating corn.It 's obvious this show can 't stand against TAS but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn 't work for me . The plots aren 't good and they don 't develop any better . They 've been written for the demographic of children under twelve . Should children be able to enjoy a show ? Of course they should . This shouldn 't be an adult show with swearing , nudity , and gratuitous violence . But the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages . This show misses that mark.Is this show a TAS ? No , of course not . The problem is it 's not even a JLU . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Oh my . How can they make movies of such beauty , but that are so terribly bad . I mean , even Uwe Boll doesn 't make crap like this . There is not even a hint of a decent story , multi-layered characters , or attraction . It 's just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a ' movie ' . I suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it , given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent , that anyone older would be annoyed by it . But then again , it 's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age , that there 's probably no one that should watch this movie at all.Take my advice and stay far , far away from this movie . Your little daughter can make a better storyline , and though she probably isn 't able to draw pictures this pretty , her tales are much more worth listening to . And please , in the name of whoever you believe in , do not expose your children to this piece of * * * * . I 'll give it 2 out of 10 , and that 's exclusively for the graphics , because the story and character development are so awful they 'd deserve a negative rating.And if you decide to watch it anyways ... remember that I warned you . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'd love to write a little summary of this movie 's plot , but ... there simply isn 't one ! If you just take a look at the plot keywords for this title , you pretty much know the entire content of the film : sex , breasts , exploitation , female frontal nudity and women 's prison ! 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more . " " Escape of the Island Women " " ( an alternate title that isn 't even listed here ) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial woman-in-prison classic , but it totally lacks the brutality of one . WIP-flicks are meant to blend graphic sexual images with shocking violence , but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex . Director Erwin Dietrich surely can 't compete with specialists in the field , like Jess Franco or Joe D 'Amato , and he should have sticked to making ordinary soft-core flicks . The only aspects that slightly look like cult-cinema are the resemblance of the tyrant-president with Fidel Castro and the group-rape of a ( minor ? ) girl by soldiers . The girls are ravishing , though , and the Ibiza filming location looks very enchanting . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Just finished watching this movie . I couldn 't imagine watching this on VHS , as there were scenes where I needed the subtitles to hear through an accent or sound effect , even though the scene itself was in English.Visually , the movie is pretty appealing . The few CG effects were very obvious insertions , but the prosthetics / creature effects weren 't bad . Not perfect , but photography and editing ( which were pretty good ) made up for a lot . Acting was generally bad , though how much of that can be blamed on the director I couldn 't say , having never seen any of the actors before . The exception , I think , was M. Gomez ( Uxia ) . She stole every scene she had a part in , and not just because of a very pretty face , but there was something akin to an urgency to her performance that none of the others had . The writing could have been a lot better - the plot was still unmistakably Lovecraft , and plenty of Lovecraft details were written in , but I personally could have done without most of the dialogue . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Tom Selleck plays an absentee son to senile " " pop " " Don Ameche and weary mom Anne Jackson , making up for his indiscretions ( one presumes ) and taking them in after Ameche has burned down his mobile home ; meanwhile , Selleck 's job is vanquished by the F.B.I. , his assets are frozen , his wife and kids leave him and his obnoxious sister and her brats have come to stay . Brightly-painted comedy-of-ills is as out of touch with reality as Ameche 's doddering old coot . Perhaps a serious first draft ( with scenes such as Ameche walking out into traffic with two toddlers ) was incorporated into a sillier second or third version ( with Selleck getting poked , bumped , prodded , and eventually losing a toe and a testicle ! ) . Either way , it 's a painful experience , and Selleck 's sudden dedication to his father makes little sense ; he hobbles around and howls in pain , but retains his heart of mush .

This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen . The part where they loose there daughter ? with the poltergeist overtone rip off ? just pushes it over the edge with stupidity . I watched it on showtime so it still had the cheese soft-core porn scenes in it . I have to say it made me laugh my ass off . The 80 's 3d effects were very out of place . Included an invisible cat and a spinning vortex . Wow I wonder if the people who made this actually feel accomplished in life . The actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyhow .

" After having watched Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it , I finally had a chance to see it 's sequel Life In Transformation .

The Philip Glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first . Compared with Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless .

" Hmm혚 I agree with the reviewer who said that " " strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film " . " I thought the film was intriguing enough to watch it . I think that was primarily because of Marsden and Speedman - not the plot.The bottom line is that this film is mildly psychologically tantalizing on the one hand and profoundly homophobic on the other . Thumbs up on the former and triple thumbs down on the latter . I 'm not sure if the film is intended to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propaganda.I thought the acting was mediocre . A lot of conversation that was about 90 degrees askew of reality . I kept wanting to derive some meaning from the plot , but it 's ultimately just a conversation with a mad man ( Speedman ) . I feel mildly sorry for him ( Speedman ) because of his loss , but not really . His loss is no greater and certainly is less than losses suffered every day around the world by more significant causes.Does the film expose naivet챕 about HIV / AIDS ? Yes : That of the intended audience . Is HIV a dark , mysterious , evil killer ? What about it 's victims ? The answer to both questions is NO . Neither HIV nor its victims have any more or less malevolent intent than lupus , multiple sclerosis , TB , hepatitis , CANCER , or their victims , FOR GOD 'S SAKE . Just because a disease is communicable does not make it EITHER deliberate OR negligent - or evil - it just IS.Does this excuse ignorance or fool-hardy risk taking ? - NO . Should all people practice safe sex ? - YES . Will safe sex save the world ? - NO . Is safe sex realistic in all instances of love and lust between passionate and emotional human beings ? 혯 OF COURSE NOT . What kind of a world would we live in if everyone followed the rules , no one ever took risks , and sex was never spontaneous and passionate ? ? ? Am I ignoring that the film deals specifically with gay sex ? 혯 YES . HIV is spread by sharing blood or bodily fluids between infected and non-infected individuals . Sex is not necessary for transmission , gay or otherwise.I 'm always disturbed by willful violence of one person upon another . I actually thought the film did do a good job of portraying the absurdity of Tom 's violent abduction , captivity , and intent towards Dan , and this kind of insane violence does occur every day.Stream of consciousness notes from the film : Tom is crazy.Why doesn 't Dan ask " " why " " do you feel this way , rather than " " what are you doing " " ? Implication : men who have sex with men get " " AIDS " " Implication : HIV = AIDS Where was Tom 's responsibility in the sex act ? Why was it Dan 's responsibility to use the condom ? " " maybe you slipped it off before you stuck it in혚 " " What are we talking about here ? Was one of the parties unconscious ? " " Maybe she didn 't want to hear the truth " " are you kidding me " " She 's up in heaven and so unbelievably hurt about what she now knows about me " " 혚right혚 Is Dan 's life over if he has HIV ? Certainly NOT ! Is this why the whole world is so homophobic ? ? ? ? They think gay men are the cause of HIV , that they will give it to the rest of the world , and we will all die혚 are you kidding me ? ? ? Are people really stupid enough to think that homosexuality is the cause ... is the problem ? ? ? Do we feel that way about the victims of tuberculosis ? of malaria ? I can see that Tom is hurt because of his wife 's death , and he blames it on AIDS , but seriously혚 who 's at fault here ? The victim or the virus ? Are illnesses really the responsibility of the ill ? ( presuming they did not seek and did not seek to spread the disease ) .Sure , safe sex is essential to a safe life , but so is not-driving , not-flying , not-leaving the house , not-living . Do we really want to blame the disease on the victims ? Would safe sex between Tom and Dan have prevented Tom 's wife 's ultimate demise ? Perhaps , but not Dan 's sole responsibility.Tom is crazy . Did I mention that.Tom to Dan : " " maybe you get what you deserve " " 혚 COME ON ! 24 Days : Violent , na챦ve , and homophobic.Am I overreacting ? Perhaps . But I think this film points a judging finger at gay men for their reckless and malevolent intent towards a " " straight world " " by practicing unsafe sex , when the rate of homosexuals practicing safe sex is proportionately equivalent or better than that of heterosexuals .

Rather apt , considering the sorry state of this movie , a sequel to a film which patently didn 't need one.What really irritates about Robocop 2 is that the makers obviously didn 't understand why the original was so good in the first place . Robocop ( 7 ) was a witty , vibrant satire of bad action movies . Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie.Thin on dialogue , particularly towards the tedious , shoot-out finale , it attracts little interest and possesses none of the energy or spirit of the original . The spoof ads , now a little tasteless ( " " Warning : continued use will cause skin cancer " " ) seem merely there as an afterthought . And calling a new designer drug " " Nuke " " is nowhere near as subtle or as funny as the original 's family board game , " " Nuke 혩em ! " " The stop-motion animation 혯 the weakest element of the original 혯 is used more extensively , while this humourless sequel fails to include a credits sequence , which makes it look even more cheap and hurried . Ah , humourless ? You might say . But what about the funny mayor , or the way Robo is reprogrammed to spout platitudes ? Yes , these are attempts at light relief , as is Robo tightening himself up with a screwdriver ( " " we 're only human " " ) for the film 's punchline , but none are likely to induce laughter . Like the rest of the film , they 're staid and moronic attempts at entertainment.The third and final film in the series ( imaginatively titled Robocop 3 ; 5 ) saw Peter Weller leave , to be replaced by Robert John Burke , who does well in a undemanding role . With toned-down language and violence , it was an obvious plea to the kiddie market , a Robo action figure much plugged throughout . With it 's social conscience too overstated , and Robocop 's new-found arm attachments and jetpack getting too silly , the final film was never destined to be a masterpiece . Yet fluid direction by Fred Dekker and a flowing pace make this one enjoyably throwaway viewing.Robocop , then , is the film proper . Robocop 3 is the sequel which you could watch if there was nothing better on . Which leaves the second movie hanging in the middle , an unwatchable dirge of a picture . A franchise vehicle that has nothing to say , save for the pound signs that rung up . Irvin Kershner is no Paul Verhoven , just as comic artist Frank Miller and partner Walon Green aren 't the writers that Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner were .

" Woa , talk about awful . Do not waste your time . I wish I had seen the other use comments first . I have to admit , I didn 't watch the whole thing . It was just too horrible . The worst , sappiest dialogue ... I could go on and on . But what really made it unwatchable was the direction . The poor actors . You can 't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action . If you check the director 's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn 't have a chance . This would not even be good as a made for TV flick .

" The 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world , with an emphasis on wild animals , exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures . Despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place , and then bringing ' em back alive ( with the film footage ) , such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional Hollywood features ... because there were no expensive sets , costumes , or high-priced movie stars.The most successful makers of such films ( artistically and financially ) were the team of Martin E. Johnson and his wife Osa , who made several documentaries ( sometimes with blatantly staged events ) in Africa and Asia . The Johnsons ' safari films were extremely popular , inspiring several parodies ... most notably Wheeler & Woolsey 's " " So This is Africa " , " in which the very sexy Esther Muir plays a character named Mrs. Johnson-Martini ( instead of Martin E. Johnson , geddit ? ) . Although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time , the Johnsons ' films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour . Viewed from our own more enlightened ( I hope ) standpoint , this is a serious flaw in the Johnsons ' documentaries : there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana Johnson and his wife.One definite asset of these movies is the presence of Osa Johnson . Ten years younger than her husband , she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter . While certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond Esther Muir , Osa Johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co-produced with her husband . ' Congorilla ' is probably the best of the Johnsons ' films . The shots of the Congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930 . The shots of the Pygmies and other natives are also interesting , although these suffer from the Johnsons ' penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look ' wild ' and alien.The best ( and funniest ) scene in ' Congorilla ' is an improvised sequence in which Osa Johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some Pygmy women . ( The dance is the Black Bottom , no less ... the same dance which Bob Hope famously taught to Daisy and Violet Hilton , the conjoined twins . ) Wearing jodhpurs , riding boots , and a pith helmet , Osa Johnson starts scat-singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the African women . Meanwhile , they just stand there staring at her , apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish . It 's a very funny scene , but it has unpleasant undertones . Osa Johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black Americans : the implication seems to be that black Africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration ( using natural rhythm , I guess ) because it 's in their blood , or something.I 'll rate ' Congorilla ' 4 points out of 10 . This film says a little bit about African life in the 1930s and rather more about American cultural perceptions in that same decade . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I couldn 't relate to this film . I 'm surprised that people are lauding it for being so ' realistic ' . How many people at your school were victim to incest ? How many closet homosexual jocks were there ? How many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide ? Hmmm . OK you wouldn 't know even if their were . But really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with . And yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored . But hey , where 's the ' entertainment ' in that ? With regards to the girl who committed suicide - I found this to be exploitative . I actually think MANY people in High School at some stage feel invisible , ignored and unwanted . But what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed ? The filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative . And the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative . I didn 't buy it as a real life scenario.And the problems of the other students I didn 't fully relate to . Bullying is explored but that 's been done to death , we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person . Closet homosexuality ? Pfft , another clich챕 gets rolled out . Thats the thing really , too many clich챕s . I guessed the ending at the start . There was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense . You 've got all these characters with explosive problems , and one with apparently none . And I thought , what is the point of this character unless she 's the unsuspecting suicide victim ? And surely enough .. One thing I will say , and it is the saving grace of the film , is that it does NOT glamourise suicide . The suicide is very graphic and heart-breaking to watch . It is a powerful scene ( regardless of how contrived it is ) and one that dismisses suicide as the easy option . But the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes.Not bad but certainly not groundbreaking OR worthy of a 17-minute standing ovation at Cannes ? ? ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If it is true that the movie only cost 150K to make , it explains a lot . But , it doesn 't explain why it has no real plot .

The ending was really dumb and made me wish I would have just shut the movie off and gone to bed early . Pretty good acting considering there wasn 't much to go with . If you enjoy really bad movies with horrible lighting ( even for a cave ) and bad camera work ( even for a cave ) ... then you 'll really like this movie . By the way , if the boy 's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old or so , how could he have forgotten how to speak , and built up so much anger ? ? Wouldn 't he have wanted to get help from the first people he had seen even if it was 14 years later ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Usually , I start my reviews with an explanation of how and why I watched the film I 'm reviewing . With this , I simply cannot explain . I needed to be awake early for work the next day so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a film that I didn 't know anything about . But something kept me glued to my comfy futon as I watched this Heather Graham vehicle . Oh , that 's right . Boredom.Graham plays Joline , a bohemian nut-case who seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the guy she married ( played by Luke Wilson ) . When her hubby decides to set off in search of better things ( work , women and scripts , presumably ) , Joline begins a fanatical quest to find her husband and free him from his " " spiritual wheelchair " . " It sounds like I 'm making this up but sadly , I 'm not . In reality , this is little more than an acting exercise for Graham as she gamely gives this Phoebe-from-Friends role a work-out . Oh and Goran " " ER " " Visnjic is in there as well , for some reason.The TV schedules had this down as a comedy but I failed to find a single laugh anywhere . It struck me that this was a personal journey for Lisa Krueger ( the director and writer ) , in the same mould as " " Girl , Interrupted " " but even that had more laughs than this . Graham 's character is simply too self-centred for the audience to care about and I felt sorry for the hen-pecked husband as he bravely fought for his freedom from his clearly mental wife . Very little of this film made sense as characters simply appeared in the story as though they were standing around , waiting for Graham to turn up like the extras in " " The Truman Show " . " In fact , the only positive note I can produce from my scribblings was " " Heather Graham - nice baps " . " And that wasn 't because I was too tired to enjoy the film.In truth , it 's very difficult to think of anybody to recommend this film to . Graham purists ( a VERY small number of overall movie-goers , I think you 'll agree ) will have to be committed to watch this dross and possibly hippy students who collect American Indian dream-catchers will take something from this . I was amazed that the average rating ( at time of writing ) was 5.0 - that would make this film as good as " " Die Another Day " " and " " Gothika " " in my book and that simply ain 't right . " " Committed " " is a quirky oddball mess of a movie that neither entertains or enlightens . It 's complicated , pointless and simply too boring for my tastes and probably yours too . Don 't even think about watching this . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Thats not saying much . This Killjoy film has better cinematography and is more professional looking than the last . That doesn 't mean it 's more professional sounding .

This Killjoy is honestly the downright worst actor I 've seen in any movie , and I 've seen a lot of movies . Thed last movie the clown came in about 15 minutes in , this one 's shorter and the clown doesn 't even come in until 40 minutes in , and it 's only 65 minutes long ! ! !

" I confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies , and while I sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror , but when it comes to comedies , they really need to be crazy to be funny . ' Over Her Dead Body ' seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously , and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect I can think about . The story is completely unbelievable of course , and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register . The choice of the principal actresses was awful . While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy , the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as Eva Longoria seems too aged ( sorry ) for him , and Lake Bell seems too unattractive ( sorry again ) . A romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start . Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles . The rest is uninteresting and uninspired , with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies . Nothing really worth watching , nothing to remember . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Yes this movie features a gal named Jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too ( well she only causes a tree to fall once , but she does say everything is evil ) .

Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy . Of course they don 't know this until the owner of the farm 's helpers open the box containing the head . The head proceeds to hypnotize everyone it can so it can get to Jessica and use her powers to find stuff to help look for his body .

" Before the release of George Romero 's genre-defining Night of the Living Dead , zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures . They certainly had much better table-manners in the old days . But social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie-going public ? Judging by this film , none whatsoever.The story is about an expedition to Cambodia , whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication . One of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army.This film is basically a love triangle with zombies . But seeing as this is a 30 's movie , the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh-eating variety we think of today . They seem to respond to mind-control , rather than insatiable appetites . And , quite frankly , the ' revolt ' is somewhat underwhelming too . The whole thing is really very dull . Aside from the lack of horror , there isn 't any over-the-top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained . It seems unlikely that this could 've provided much entertainment even 70 years ago . See it if you have to see everything with ' zombie ' in the title but otherwise I would advise skipping this one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" to be honest , i didn 't watch all of the original ' howling ' , but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie. so great , that seven horrible sequels had to be made. they started off with " " Howling II : Your Sister Is A Werewolf " . " i got this movie on VHS from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when Atari was brand new. i just watched it last night , and it wasn 't really BAD , it was just weird. i mean , the whole thing with Sybil Danning going three-way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing ( but kinda hot ) , Christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she 's a vampire , etc. actually , this movie was actually like some sort of mish-mash of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except with werewolves , because everything Christopher Lee ( whom played Dracula himself ) was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie ( stake in the heart , garlic , the creature of the night must die AT NIGHT , and the ruler of werewolves lives in TRANSYLVANIA ) . not much for the acting , but the worst of it came from Annie McEnroe. i swear , at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out , because that damn throat always had to say SOMETHING . Anyway , the plot is pretty silly and clich챕d , so there 's no real point in telling you , you could just read about it on Wikipedia . By the way , the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it 's the ONLY film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original ( not counting Howling IV ( 1988 ) , which was a remake of the original , or in other words , a sequel based on the same novel ) . so don 't see this movie. there 's no real horror , hardly any werewolves , and just horrible special fx . 3 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is an " " anthology " " horror film . It 's made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of Robert Bloch ( who wrote for Weird Tales and was personal friends with H.P. Lovecraft , but is most famous for the original story " " Psycho " " ) . The quality of the stories is very uneven and I didn 't think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all . It would have been better to do it as a comedy like " " Comedy of Terrors . " " Only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way , and it 's probably the best of them ( the one with Ingrid Pitt ) . I 've seen a few of these Amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was Freddie Francis ' " " Tales from the Crypt . " " The anthology style works well for the producers , because it means that they can hire a bunch of " " big name " " actors , employ them for only one week of shooting or so , and then bring in the next big name . So you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee . But that 's very unfortunate for the audience , because the audience would like to see some scenes with Peter Cushing , Christopher Lee , and Ingrid Pitt actually acting together . Instead they 're stuck in these vignettes by themselves . So let 's take them one at a time , briefly.The first story has Denholm Elliot , who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character . Unfortunately the actor who plays Dominic , the source of the horror , Tom Adams , just looks silly which ruins any possible horror . There 's some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though , like the scene where Dominic kills Elliot 's psychiatrist . It 's the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching , so the whole audience is supposed to shout out " " LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU ! " " The second story is the one with Peter Cushing . God I love that man so much . Too bad so many of his films , like this one , pretty much stink . In the story he 's supposed to be pining away for a long-lost love , and he sees her likeness in a wax museum . It 's a completely predictable story that goes nowhere.Then you have the bit with Christopher Lee , where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch . Again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs . But instead we 're supposed to be horrified when Lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil . The actress , Chloe Franks , was pretty good in that type of " " Bad Seed " " role though.The last story is kind of amusing ... Ingrid Pitt plays an actress and Jon Pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire . That 's about all the story has to offer . I was surprised at how bad Ingrid Pitt 's English is , I guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films I 've seen her in.Not a very memorable film or one that I would recommend to anyone but horror completists . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Wow , the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago . I 'll preface by saying I 'm not a fan of narrated episodes . If the story / actors / etc. are worth their salt , they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out , reminded me of personages who can 't think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters . The psychobabble was tedious and boring , but some enjoy that kind of thing , it 's just not my cup O tea . They could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something . Niggling little things like Peugeot being at the house , which has a singular half circle driveway , yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under , because it 's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property . Sloppy editing , as she pulls into the driveway ( for what seems the 100th time ) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house ? The dolly close-ups were also overdone , like some Jr . High drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time . I could keep picking apart , but that might get almost as boring as this episode was . It kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of Elaine driving the Newport convertible . I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player , automatic top etc .

" I 'm a big horror film buff , particularly of the 1980 's subgenres . Name one 혯 I 've probably seen it . Last year , a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under mainstream radar called " " Saw " " was about to hit theaters . I was moderately excited . Having not heard anything about it , I thought it looked quite promising judging by the previews and posters ( well , except the back and white ones with the severed hands and feet ... those just looked terrible ! ) I saw the film on opening night . It was one of the worst experiences of my life . This movie was literally mentally and psychically painful to watch . Because it was scary ? ... NO ! Because it was one of the most awful movies I had ever had the displeasure of seeing ! First off , the construction of the screenplay and editing was utterly atrocious , even by horror movie standards . Starting off a sequence in an interrogation room with a victim ( Shawnee Smith ) who recently survived a serial killer 's attack , then showing a flashback of what she survived ? NOT SCARY ! It was impossible to feel any type of tension WHATSOEVER knowing that the aforementioned victim was perfectly alright . Sure , that reverse-bear-trap thing was creepy ... but WHY should I feel in the least bit frightened when CLEARLY , you just showed me she survived the ordeal ? Unfortunately , the entire film was constructed this way . It starts with two guys in a cellar . Then , they show flashbacks of how they were abducted ... NOT SCARY ! Why ? Because we already know what 's gonna happen to them , seeing as how we JUST SAW the result of the attack . THEY 'RE FINE ! Move on with the story ! Even more unfortunately , the actual story was meager at best . I couldn 't have cared less for these annoying , pitiful excuses for " " characters " " and the acting didn 't help . Cary Elwes was solid for the most part and then suddenly towards the end he started crying like a lost infant while straining to keep his American accent in tact ( it didn 't work 혯 the audience I saw this with was in stitches ) . This drove him to a rash and idiotic decision even the most simple-minded wouldn 't attempt . He had other options . Better ones . SMARTER ONES . Even given his intense emotional state ( horribly communicated through horrible acting ) , it was still irrational . I didn 't buy it . BAD WRITING ALERT ! Furthermore , even when certain sequences were played straight-through and flashback-free , they were painfully predictable . I constantly found my foot tapping impatiently waiting for the dumb sequence to end . This happened for the entire film . I saw every single " " twist " " coming . Twenty minutes into the film , I had already called the killer 's identity , not to mention his connection to his " " accomplice ( s ) " " as SOON as they appeared on screen . Better acting might 've been able to overshadow the awful script . Instead , the actors might as well have had " " RED-HERRING " " or " " ACCOMPLICE " " tattooed across their foreheads.By the end of the movie , I was utterly outraged I had wasted even a fragment of my life on this film , and the entire theatre was laughing hysterically at the downright horrendous finale . Seriously , you 'd think they were watching a Monty Python movie . I would 've been laughing too , had I not been so angered at the film 's total and utter failure to accomplish ANYTHING it set out to do . When we left , there was ( no joke ) a line to speak to the manager of the theatre to get their money back ( didn 't happen ) . I was absolutely positive the movie was going to be a box-office bomb . The following week , you couldn 't have imagined my shock to find out " " Saw " " had hit number one at the box office and EVERYONE was talking about it ( mostly individuals who found " " Napoleon Dynamite " " to be a thought-provoking epic tale and thought " " satire " " was some type of rubber ) . I am so utterly sickened to hear people praise this film that I often feel as though I 'm going to vomit . It 's entertainment for the most feeble and simple-minded of the human race . Those who find some weird Jigsaw clown-puppet riding on a tricycle threatening ( it 's a doll 혯 knock it over and leave 혯 what 's so frightening about that ? ) .Don 't get me wrong , I own every " " Friday the 13th " , " love my splatter movies , thought " " Napoleon Dynamite " " was hilarious , can 't get enough of Freddy , Michael , Pinhead , or Leatherface , have a font appreciation for unknown horror gems and rank " " Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers " " amongst my Top 10 Favorite Slashers . However , I realize these films aren 't the most sophisticated American cinema has to offer 혯 I appreciate them for what they are 혯 quick , easy fun . " " Saw " " is cinematic garbage . The film attempts to be a smart and semi-sophisticated , nasty little thrill ride , and bogs down to an irritating , annoying waste of time , money , energy , and celluloid . Atrocious on all accounts . Every single copy should be incinerated , along with its feeble-minded fans . Shame on all of you.Will I see " " Saw II " " ? Maybe after I take a double-shot of Liquid Drano before I gouge out my own eyes and impale white-hot shish-kabob brochettes into my ears and colon . My Rating : 0 / 10 .

" I haven 't read the book of this and based on this adaptation , will not bother . I hated every character in this show - Miranda was slutty , selfish and mumbled miserably through the appalling dialogue , her sister was a total wimp , and this was the worst depiction of manic-depression I have ever seen . I have a degree in Psychology , and this was not accurate . In fact , until it was mentioned , I did not realise Troy was supposed to be bipolar - I thought he was a normal , slightly grumpy teenager.The only saving grace in this stupid show was David Tennant , whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that got me to watch the second half . Clearly the writers and producers of this show have not done any research - Troy 's mental problems are not remotely accurate , nor are the forensics involved in the " " twist " " ending ( and if you did not spot that a mile off , you are a big ole dummy ! ) Utter garbage . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I hated this show when I was a kid . That was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents , not just the bland , generic , General American Dialect we 're used to . Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf 's was southern . Like one of the others mentioned , though , I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute . That always seemed odd to me , probably because the flute just annoyed me and I wouldn 't have gone to any trouble to take it away ! Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned : Pufnstuf ripped off McDonalds . At the height of McDonalds popularity , the TV show ( or rather , their creators ) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show , but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own . They even hired former employees of McDonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the TV shows . McDonalds sued and won . Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you 'll find plenty of articles about it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago , a friend and I decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale . There was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was . To this day we still rate movies , even very bad ones , by how much better than " " The Lonely Lady " " they are.A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry , who wrote the screenplays for , among other things , " " Last Summer " " and " " Diary of a Mad Housewife , " " and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the Harold Robbins ' book " " The Lonely Lady . " " She said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didn 't think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in Hollywood . She then said " " I think they got someone else to write it . " " The interview was filmed before the movie was released . She died in 1981 , and I bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank God for saving her from involvement in the result . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Good things out of the way first : Underdog 's voice acting was FINE . But Jason Lee being awesome himself , that really is no surprise.Peter Dinklage ( Barsinister ) also did fine , for what trash was given to him . He acted the part shockingly well . And so did Patrick Warburton , the moronic assistant . Now , it was idiotic character but he acted so extremely well , I actually liked the character better than the protagonists . The lines given to him were childish but witty.However. Alex Neuberger did awful and hope he never acts again . His " " Scream " " was so disgustingly fake . Silence . Silence . " " aaahhhhhhh " . " In the scene where he hears the dog talk , an " " oh no , impossible ! " " would have sufficed in place of the pathetic fake scream.And then there was the girl and her female dog that chased Patrick 's character Cad on the roof . At first this makes sense , she 's a " " Reporter . " " A school reporter but still an inquiring mind regardless . But why , WHY the HELL did she carry her dog around ? That was worthless and the damn dog didn 't even say anything other than a heartless " " oh , underdog ! " " Her presence was extremely unnecessary.Overall , the script was pathetic . The only reason I give this movie a 3 is Barsinister , his assistance , and underdog 's voice . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " The Brain Machine " " will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it 's all about . Four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment . Since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off - none of them will be missed.The whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as The General , but it seems he 's taking his direction from a Senator who wishes to remain anonymous . Good call there on the Senator 's part . There 's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on , who later claims he doesn 't take his direction from the General or ' The Project ' . Too bad he wasn 't more effective , he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey.If nothing else , the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970 's technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones , room size computers and a teletype machine that won 't quit . Perhaps that was the basis of the film 's alternate title - " " Time Warp " " ; nothing else would make any sense . As for myself , I 'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered Dr. Krisner 's experiment titled ' Group Stress Project ' . It applies to the film 's actors and viewers alike.Keep an eye out just above The General 's head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon , a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds.You may want to catch this flick if you 're a die hard Gerald McRaney fan , could he have ever been that young ? James Best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend , but don 't call him Father .

" I just caught this on Showtime ... ewwwwwww , not even fun in a bad movie kind of way . One of the lamest monster flicks I 've ever seen . Plus the TV reporter in the movie was that annoying Jerri from a past season of Survivor . The only amusing thing was that the " " secret base " " was the house from Fantasy Island ( and a million other movies and TV shows ; the place is located in the L.A. area ) . I fully expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors . If Tattoo had gotten eaten by the snake , I might have given this movie a 2 , but oh well . Watching people stand there and scream for five minutes while the Komodo or the cobra loomed over them instead of making a run for it was pretty funny , especially because you could really tell that they were just screaming at an empty spot where the computer animators would later paint in the monster . I nearly fell out of my chair , though , when in a flashback scene they brought in either the cobra or the komodo - then normal size - in some indestructible solid steel container with some air holes drilled into it . Wouldn 't a wire cage have sufficed ? LOL ! Guess they couldn 't afford to rent a real komodo and cobra .

" The genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one . The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY . I realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next , but this movie was so predictable , and is just not believable . I find that the more I watch this kind of movie , the more I am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger . Continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid . If they took the time to make it more realistic , I might have enjoyed it a little .

But to get him to run a lot , you would need to give him a woman to chase after.Its not that some of the stunts can 't be funny . For example the running joke with one of the councilors who is always waking up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed . Instead , its that the jokes and stunts were poorly setup and executed . It just failed to be funny.To somebody who loves comedy , this is a pain . Others are glued to it for life .

" After seeing the previews I felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast & furious series . So , I already expected it to have a lacking storyline , but at least this time it won 't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans . Unfortunately , I was wrong . If you could only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you.This is the absolute worst movie I had ever seen ( I 'm being nice - no I would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said ) . Not only was the storyline non-existent , but the action was crap too . I guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie . For an example , there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win . And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his " " girls " " ( an Imus comment would work in this case ) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert . After this wonderful scene I couldn 't take it anymore . So , I only got to see half of this monstrosity . This is the first movie I had ever walked out on . Afterwards , I had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells.I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option .

" Ken Harrison , a young sculptor in his early thirties , is seriously injured in a road accident . End of story . " " End of story " , " that is , in the sense of " " end of any physical action " . " Not in the sense of " " end of the film " . " Ken 's life is saved , but he is paralysed from the neck down . When he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive . The rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die.Ken 's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor , Michael Emerson . Although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms , here it is presented in purely secular ones . If Dr Emerson has any deep religious convictions , these are never expressed in the film . He believes passionately , however , that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight ; to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a dereliction of that duty . Ken therefore finds himself in a " " Catch-22 " " situation . He must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life . Emerson , however , considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality . Ken 's dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital.Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes as Dr Emerson put across their respective points of view skilfully and with sincerity , but this cannot hide the fact that " " Whose Life is it Anyway ? " " simply does not work as a film . At one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media . When plays were filmed , therefore , the general tendency was to " " open them up " " by filming on location as well as on studio sets , by taking liberties with the playwright 's text , often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters.I have never seen Brian Clarke 's play , but I suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema . There is very little physical action ; most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies paralysed . Such a plot does not lend itself to the " " opening up " " device at all , and the resulting film is very static , dominated by talk at the expense of action . Although it is well written and there is some good acting , I am surprised that a film was ever made of such an uncinematic subject . 4 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 've been a fan of Jim Henson and his characters since the very beginning . The most beguiling thing about them was the love and innocence and camaraderie shown . Kermit was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving . A spiritual character , yet sweetly and believably so . All the other characters were slightly eccentric but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings can co-exist in a caring manner together , respecting each other 's difference.Following movies have somewhat kept the same vibe . Yet this " " It 's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie " " would have Jim Henson spinning in his grave . These characters have been completely re-written to be horny , nasty , selfish , and cheesy.The cast goes on to portray God as an uncaring corporate head , with a mean streak . Angels as spineless , non-spiritual corporate staff , and the movie was so bad I had to stop watching . I had bought it for my great-nephew but fortunately I preview anything I give a child.This movie deserved the trash bin instead and has no socially redeeming content or charm.Shame , shame on the people who re-wrote the characters and departed from Jim Henson 's original heart-centered , socially conscious version . It does a terrible disservice to a great hearted man who is no longer around to defend his creations . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hedy Lamarr who may have been kept by more men on screen than any other actress , is again the kept mistress of Kent Taylor , society playboy and general all around rat . On a boat from the Yucatan after Taylor 's given her the brush she tries suicide . But Doctor Spencer Tracy saves her from drowning in the Caribbean.Tracy 's quite the all around medical fellow . I guess he never heard the word specialist . He runs a clinic in Manhattan for the poor and his trip was a sideline into medical research . Lamarr and he marry and she tries to introduce him into her world and he even becomes a partner of society doctor Louis Calhern . Of course Kent Taylor reenters the picture and the Hollywood inevitable happens.Watching I Take This Woman it seemed to me that the writers were very much influenced by Tracy 's Oscar winning Boys Town . Unfortunately his role as Doctor Karl Decker ain 't a patch on what he did as Father Flanagan . Maybe they were trying to give Father Flanagan a little romance in his life in this film so to speak.Tracy and Lamarr did not get along too well . In fact this film was dubbed I Retake This Woman because the original director Joseph Von Sternberg walked off the film , presumably because Lamarr was not working out for him the way Marlene Dietrich did . She did Lady of the Tropics and then MGM went back to filming this with their contract director Woody Van Dyke who was known for the speed of his productions . And a whole new supporting cast was brought in.Fortunately both Spence and Hedy had better roles in store for both of them . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" * * * SPOILERS ! * * * I sometimes wonder what makes sequel-makers think that they have to explain ( and therefore destroy ) the mysteries behind iconic Horror films . The original " " Hellraiser " " of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made . The 1988 sequel " " Hellbound " " was also a fantastic Horror film , though I personally didn 't like how the viewer got background information on the Cenobites , some of the all-time creepiest Horror-villains in the original . The third part , " " Hell on Earth " " ( 1992 ) was already quite a mess , whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy lead-cenobite Pinhead ( a typical 90s stupidity ) and therefore destroyed most of his scariness . This fourth part " " Hellraiser : Bloodline " " ( 1996 ) is slightly more atmospheric than the third one , but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary ' background information ' about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hell.Seriously - did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made ? I think not , and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film . The setting of " " Bloodline " " goes back and forth in three different periods . The film begins in a 22nd century space-station , when scientist Dr. Merchant ( Bruce Ramsay ) attempts to close the gates to hell forever . When government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons . In 18th century Paris , Merchant 's ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult . An evoked demon , the princess of hell , took over the body of the beautiful Angelique ( Valentina Vargas ) . Since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it , the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages ... The film , which takes place in the 18th century , the present , and the 22nd century , really is quite a mess . I admit that the part set in the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film , but its also its smallest part . The parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak , and filled with stupid and unworthy elements . The film 's undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make-up and gore-effects , the absolutely ravishing Valentina Varagas as the she-demon , and Pinhead ( Doug Bradley ) , who , in spite of having lost some of his creepiness , still is a menacing villain . It is an almost offensive idea for " " Hellraiser " " fans , however , that Pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light-show . Overall , " " Bloodline " " is not a complete disaster , but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly . Even director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed about it , as he preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee . Overall , this is only recommendable to hardcore Pinhead-fanatics , and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demon 's creepiness . All others are well-advised to stick with the brilliant first , and excellent second part of the " " Hellraiser " " franchise and skip all the others . The makeup effects in " " Bloodline " " are creepy as hell , but almost everything else is disappointing . My rating : 3.5 / 10 , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I happened to spot this flick on the shelf under " " new releases " " and found the idea of a hip-hop zombie flick far too interesting to pass up . That 's how it was billed on the box , anyhow , and I thought to myself , " " What a great idea ! " " Plus there 's a " " Welcome to Oakland " " sign on the cover , too . How could I resist ? Unfortunately , the hip-hop part only lasted for as long as the opening theme . Neither hip-hop music nor hip-hop culture had much of a role in the movie . Having lived in Oakland myself , I know that there are many aspiring hip-hop artists there , so the low budget of this flick was no excuse not to have a fitting soundtrack . Any number of struggling artists would have jumped on the opportunity to contribute to this flick . Why the Quiroz Brothers didn 't take advantage of this is beyond me.Once the film got rolling , it was a completely typical zombie movie with a cast that just so happened to be completely black and Latino . You might think that this would put an unusual slant on the movie ... but it didn 't . Somehow , the Quiroz Brothers vision of " " urban culture " " boils down to drive-by shootings and dropping an F-bomb in every line in the movie . The rapid-fire use of the word " " fuck " " is probably this movie 's most distinguishing characteristics ; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times , and no line didn 't contain it at least once . I 'm not at all squeamish about swearing in a movie , but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the writers ( also the Quiroz Brothers ) , and the script was generally very poor.The film was generally a disappointment . It would have been interesting to see a genuinely " " urban culture " " zombie flick , but " " Hood of the Living Dead " " doesn 't deliver on that count . The characters in the movie could just as easily have been white or eskimo or anything else . There was no distinct flavor to the movie . It 's just another run-of-the-mill low budget flick with bad acting , lousy writing , amateurish direction , bland cinematography , a cheap soundtrack , and nothing at all to recommend it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" ' The Curse of Frankenstein ' sticks faithfully to Mary Shelley 's story for one word of the title , which wouldn 't be so bad if the changes were any good at all . The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankenstein 's family has been completely excised and replaced with ... nothing . The heart and moral centre of the story is gone . It doesn 't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving , devious murderer ; he deserves everything he gets . The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clich챕s . Even taken on its own terms , this is rubbish : a bland , rambling film featuring a shite-looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut . As it 's the first of Hammer 's horror films , directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee , its place in horror history is secure .

The two oldest step-siblings , Derek and Casey , are equally annoying ; I get the impression that we 're supposed to side with Casey , given that she 's the protagonist , but I don 't find her at all likable . The parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless . The three younger children are the most watchable things on the show ; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet the way they team up , and Marti is adorable .

With all that aside , lil pimp was simply pathetic . I saw it on TV and just didn 't know what I was watching . It was too poorly written and cheesy to be an adult movie , and had way too much sex , innuendo and swearing to be a kid 's movie , in fact , I doubt even kids would be amused by it . The humor ( pretty generous even calling it that ) was so pretentious and campy , I couldn 't see how anyone with half a mind could even find it funny . The only thing that made me laugh was how people like Bernie mac and ludicrous could put their name and time onto / into something so hurting . Luda 's character was such a cheap ploy for laughs , which fell extremely short of its goal . The plot didn 't make any sense whatsoever , the storyline has got to be the worst sequence of events ever put together on screen .

" It 's funny how instinct warns you of something . For example as soon as the company credits read Nu Image I knew instinctively I 'd seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn 't remember where . Nevertheless I just knew JUDGE AND JURY was going to be crap and it was . Maybe I 'm psychic ? ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! The opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time . I don 't know about you but I 'm geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language , especially if it 's spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie . Anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife . Oh did I mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night ? Yeah he 's a serious badass mofo . In fact he 's so bad ( And I don 't mean the acting - I 'll get to that in a moment ) that he 's impossible to take seriously and this is before he 's executed only to return as Elton John , Elvis , a French chef etc .

What a pity this reviewer didn 't have any fun whatsoever watching JUDGE AND JURY . Hey maybe the producers could send me Keith 's fee ? Gawd only knows I deserve it.I disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn 't guessed and my main beef isn 't with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence . If like me you 've had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you 'll know violence is an obscene painful thing , but JUDGE AND JURY will have you believe that if you 're thrown through a window , crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you 'll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs .

" Whether any indictment was intended must be taken into consideration . If in the year 2000 there were still rifts of feeling between Caucasian and Afro-Americans in Georgia , such as shown in this film , obviously there remains a somewhat backward mentality among a lot of people out there . It is rather hypocritical , to say the least , if everyone adores Halle Berry , Whoopie Goldberg , Beyonc챕 , Noemi Campbell , Denzel Washington , Will Smith , et. al . , whilst out in the backs there persist manifest racial divides.White grandmother suddenly gets black grand-daughter thrust upon her , only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social backwater . The story is sweet , not lacking tragic overtones , and eminently predictable as in most of these kinds of TV films , though the final scene has you guessing ............ will he ? won 't he ....... ? Gena Rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering , and Louis Gossett is a good match for her ; the little Penny Bae fortunately does not steal the show.A ' nice ' way of relaxing after Sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much , though you might just find yourself having a little siesta in the middle of it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is one of those movies that is so bad it is awesome ! ! ! It has everything an early eighties movie needs : Flared pants , Big Moustaches , Chicks with Farrah Hair , and most importantly , NINJAS ! ! ! ! I have a few choice moments to recant for you . Cole 's army buddy has a strange monkey-like face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw . He gets his ass handed to him about every other scene by the thugs wanting his land so he gets drunk through the entire film . At one point his farm workers finally return after being run off by the gangster guy 's hired goons and Frank , I think his name is Frank , is so moved he shouts to the whole group " " Lets Have A Cock Fight ! ! " " and they all gleefully move to the cock fighting area of the farm to begin the festivities . This is funny on every level possible . Whether you take it dirty or literally it still warms my heart . Another funny thing is Sho Kosugi 's little grunts and over animated ninja style movements . I remember this dude from when I was a kid and he used to say he was the world 's only real ninja ( he had ads in martial arts magazines ) if I remember correctly . My friends and I were a little ninja crazy during the time this movie came out and I can recall seeing it in the local theater many times . I was wondering as I watched this on Starz last night why every sleazy American gangster type always has a stronghold in the Phillipines and wears a white Steve Martin suit . As a matter of fact this guy goes way beyond that in requiring all of his thugs to wear white Steve Martin suits . There is a scene where it looks like 20 Steve Martin impersonators are attacking a 1970 's Sears underwear model ( Cole ) . As we wind up for the final battle Cole very clumsily breaks into the bad guy 's headquarters and is immediately spotted by a secretary who in turn alerts a guard who fires off a round from his pump action shotgun not 30 feet from the bad guys and no one seems to notice or care . Cole , Wearing a completely white ninja outfit , proceeds to sneakily ascend a staircase then does a flip right into the area where all the bad guys are . The second in charge tells him he didn 't need to kill everybody as they were expecting him , then gives him a ride to the bad guys huge Cock Fighting arena . Don 't ask me why Cock Fighting is a huge part of this movie but it is . When they arrive Cole is still wearing his ninja mask even though everyone involved knows what he looks like without it . The final battle is approaching as Cole has killed everybody and now Sho , as I like to call him , reveals himself to have kidnapped Cole 's lady aka Frank 's wife , and they meet in the snazziest cockfighting arena you ever saw . Sho then , very politely I might add , releases said lady and the battle is about to start . They do their bowing and start circling each other , both masked by the way . When they join in battle it appears Cole becomes someone else intermittently ala " " Finishing The Game " " a funny spoof on completing Bruce Lee 's " " Game of Death " . " Cole eventually comes out on top , Kills Sho , who dies with honor by being decapitated and all is well . Next we see Cole , after ruining everyone 's life is about to split town again but not before foreshadowing the brutal death of a fat guy with a hook hand and then he inexplicably winks at the camera , freeze frame , credits , done . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Disjointed , unclear , bad screenplay , poor photography and direction ... all in all very obviously an ill-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at TBN.TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring " " China Cry " , " the story of Nora Lam , to the big screen . But " " The Omega Code " " is an unfortunate miscue . As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved " " China Cry " , " I still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone .

" I am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this , but come on ! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S @ # t I have ever seen ! I ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror , but I got bored and turned it off.Let 's see : The wardrobe : Consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot . The masks were made from what looks like tin foil . The Gore : The Gore was pretty good , I must give it that . But Ittenbach 's Burning moon was better for a low budget movie . Acting : Was horrible ! I didn 't mind the dubbing . I find this humorous like in Ittenbach 's " " Premutos " " ( great movie ) . The fighting and action sequences were pi $ $ poor.Bottom line : Don 't watch any of Schnaas 's movies . There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter .

" " Thomas and two hacks who shall remain nameless because I feel sorry for them having to attach those no-names to this turkey . Apparently actually shot on film , this direct-to-DVD release has almost nothing going for it that you haven 't seen or heard a hundred times already.Despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors like Richard " " Three O 'Clock High " " Tyson , Erick " " Stargate " " Avari , and Raymond J.

" In the opening scene of " " Malta Story " " Mr A.Guinness bore such a startling resemblance to Noel Coward that I fully expected his first words to be " " Certain women need striking regularly - like gongs " " or some such world - weary bon mot.Unfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the Master would have had trouble bringing it to life.Indeed Mr Guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find one.And therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie.Mr J.Hawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a " " Jack Hawkins " " performance without an ounce of individuality.It could have been spliced from any of a dozen British war movies.Many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose . The Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring London to its knees.The courage of the Maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the King and the island was awarded the George Cross.A worthy subject you might think for a movie , but " " Malta Story " " does not even qualify for the term " " worthy " " in its most patronising sense.It gives the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet a deadline , perhaps before the actors lost the will to live . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There is a growing trend in the media to vilify and ridicule men . One sees it in television adverts and program plots . Cheaters is a prime example , they could find plenty of female cheaters yet the vast majority shown are men , why ? The prime threat to any government 's power resides in the male population , they 're less likely to abide by authority and are more of a physical combat threat . A way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media . Other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas full of self righteous cops including big-jawed aggressive women accusing everyone they question trampling their rights and making those men feel like scum . In Australia many top male sports stars have been arrested recently for dubious assaults and drinking charges , another example of the government controlling the male populous by arresting their heroes and asserting dominance . Cheaters , aside from the political machinations is an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights , furthermore most of these women assault the men ! If it were round the other way the men would be in jail ! ! If it were an honest show they would be finding women cheaters , because they don 't normally get caught due to the fact that their male lovers are quite happy to get in no strings attached and get out without rocking the boat . Men 's mistresses want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus get the men caught anyway . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The Brothers Quay are directors , judging by conventional thought , should have stuck to making short films . I myself actually really liked their first feature , Institute Benjamenta , but judging by their sophomore effort , The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes , I 'm willing to agree they don 't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length . Piano Tuner is , without a doubt , a gorgeous film to look at , and often to listen to . Unfortunately , it 's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace . Reading the plot synopsis , it sounds like a pretty good story . But the Brothers fail miserably to bring it to life . One thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future : dialogue . My God , it 's awful here . A huge bust . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" There is NOTHING cool , hip , or clever about this film-- liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema . How can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean & ugly people are . . . SERIAL KILLERS ! If they have to dismember total strangers in order to " " be a family again , " " then we don 't WANT them to " " be a family . " " What part of that did you have trouble grasping ? Why applaud this filth ? THIS silly filth is what you do if you can 't do art ! One 's head & life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as " " interesting . " " This is a camera without a brain . What really makes an artwork cool is profundity , questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history ( or , in this case , a knowledge of ANYTHING would be preferable ! ) . Instead , this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown , thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as " " cool cause it 's so far OUT , man ! " " ) . These same violent events actually HAPPEN , every day . They are NOT " " just in the film . " " They refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to YOU . Do you WANT those things done to you ? A child could have thought this up , it required zero imagination , it is NOT surrealism . This lazy crap has no content , is saying nothing--it 's just the worst of the evening news , & it is saying nothing new , nothing we don 't already know . It 's " " the emperor 's new clothes , " " the director hoping there are enough uneducated children , proud of their streak of inhumanity , for this sloppy filth to fly . I can see director Miike 's demented fans now : chain-smoking teens-and- twenties drunks covered in tattoos , with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces , their knowledge-base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves .There is NO PLOT to this--it is just sheer exploitation of shock-value violence . There is no " " hidden meaning " " anywhere in this poorly made film . It is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic , BUT you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not THERE ! To DO that you need to view & review a REAL piece of cinema . There are PLENTY out there , directed by Fellini , Bergman , Fassbinder , Herzog , Altman , Bunuel , Kurosawa , Lynch , Tarkovsky , Peter Greenaway , Tarantino , Guillermo del Toro , Richard Linklater , Eisenstein , Aronofsky , Gus van Sant , Soderbergh , Shyamalan , Ordet . Why don 't you view a REAL art film by the likes of these giants ? This wannabe director , Miike , will NEVER make a film equal to one of the geniuses I just listed because he just doesn 't have the talent ! Anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like " " Visitor Q. " " Teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon ! There 's no message , no meaning , no plot , nothing to it at all . There are long lists of ART Films to learn from--but THIS " " Visitor Q " " is NOT an art film in any respect . It has no content to it . It 's just one banal horror piled onto another , and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things HAPPEN , every single day , somewhere in the world . They are NOT okay because they are " " just in the film . " " They refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to YOU . Do you WANT those things done to you ? To others ? Why ? Because this world is already ugly enough , thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this . There are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct , but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap . There IS no deeper meaning . There is nothing to analyze ; why keep trying ? I 've spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made , and keeping up with all the new ones , but I 've never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this . It 's not imaginative or even shocking , because these types of events happen daily all over the world . To make this film , or even to favorably review it , has caused over 50 young airheads who don 't know any better to think it 's " " cool . " " They may grow up thinking that , convincing others , some of whom may end up DOING these things--convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way , by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity . Trust me on this , --I know cool , and cool this piece of crap AIN 'T . Visitor Q has the FEEL of a genuine SNUFF film , and I 'm still not sure it isn 't , actually . Your actions have consequences , son . The world is awful enough already . Some violence like this COULD happen to YOU , or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this FAKE Art film .

" I just saw this movie last night and , being someone who had very low expectations to begin with , was still disappointed .

Also , this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didn 't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table ? Give me a break .

" Two redeeming qualities of this film were the cinemaphotography and a storyline that was hard to resist . However , the script , the direction , and some scenes , were just awful . I kept asking myself why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie . My only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity which underlies the plot of the movie , but knew the movie was filled with flaws.This film could have been so much better , and reached a larger audience accordingly .

" This movie has some good performances , as others have pointed out , but suffers ( as others have pointed out , except for the people who apparently are either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to otherwise explain why they would deem this a " " 10 " " ) from some self-conscious and self-absorbed film school padding and excess plots . This is the type of plot that Sex In The City could handle in a half hour episode , so there was no reason for it to be even an 88 minute movie . A perfect example of wasted footage is the fast forwarding montage in the first third of the movie . Some of the back story is merited , but too much time , for example , was spent on Daria character with the anal sex boyfriend and on the back story for Paulie , who was not a realistic character , although the actor did a decent job with the lines he was given . The worst aspect of the movie was the level of amateurish parts : from typos in the typed material , to bad jumps and edits , poor camera positions , angles , lighting problems throughout and , most glaringly , a poorly written script with a badly developed concept . If the writer ( also the director and lead ) had collaborated with someone , he might not have ended up with a 100 % rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes , which further belays the ability of anyone to truly believe the people who gave it a 10 on the rating system here . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it , and a slightly bigger budget.What this movie does show , is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures . Mr. Weinstein could take manure , feed it to you , and make you believe your eating bon bons . And that 's exactly what the studio did with the film .

" As far as I can understand , TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director . My doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student , since there is a reference to Oporto School of Arts in the final credits.Nevertheless , director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema . What is a movie ? How to tell a story ? It doesn 't matter , for the novice director . One of the first things you learn in school when you 're studying cinema is how to tell a story . You learn that , just like in novels , in movies you should also construct your story in three acts : the introduction , the development and the conclusion . You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax . You learn this is valid for a 3-hour-epic , for the regular movie , for a short film and even , believe it or not , for a 30-second commercial . You also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that , ultimately , you can even deconstruct it.In rough terms , TIM WATCHER introduces us its main character and then , the movie ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in Jeunet 's AM횋LIE . There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER . This is not a parody or an art film , thus you can 't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure . You are expecting to be told a story , and it doesn 't happen . Worst than that , TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning ; and one with no real purpose . It doesn 't make a point , or at least , not a valid one . Its point is childish , with a sense of vengeance . The situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is Manichaean.I was expecting a lot more from this short . The movie opens with a rather good-looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular Portuguese short film . I don 't know the budget for this movie , but judging for the thanks-list in the end credits , merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where 's difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers.TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style , color and carefully chosen plans , combined with a fine score . That 's all . There 's nothing else . There 's no plot . And that 's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values . Hardly , you can see in the regular Portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story.As absurd as the comparison may sound , I must refer the BMW shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over-the-top stylish cinematography . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" That was a waste of 9 dollars. the movie was terrible. all the " " scary " " parts were pointless and sadly repetitive . Seemingly all of the tense parts could be completely predicted , and did not seem to hold any bit of the audiences attention . Also , the plot line didn 't advance at all during the entire movie , and it was all just a big setup for the grudge 3 . When it seemed like the movie was about to make a big plot advancement , it turned out just to be a pointless scene. these directors need to follow Hitchcock 's example : every scene has a point . Porbably 90 % of the scenes in this movie could have been left out with no change of the plot . Final opinion : Don 't waste your time , energy or money ! ! ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible . I knew some of he facts about Caravagggio , but here they were twisted and puzzling . The images were weirdly interesting but I was looking more for a biographical and / or critical accounting of Caravaggio 's life and works , not an LSD type drug trip . The dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains , calculators , typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting . Had it been labelled an " " artsy film " " I wouldn 't have purchased the DVD ; now I have a DVD that I 'll never watch again and who would buy it ?

" Ok , I 've seen plenty of movies dealing with witches and the occult but this one was just plain weird . This movie starts out as this cult of witches led by a really bad Orson Wells playing the staring role ( couldn 't they have gotten somebody that looked and acted more like a Satanist ) he just did not belong in this movie at all . But anyhow , the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles somebody and makes her have a miscarrage . The lady that had the miscarrage and her husband go off to a place called Lillith on busness and the lady meanwhile is seeing an image of her sister or whoever it is calling to her and warning her to stay away from there and to never use her powers there or she will die . The couple after they get settled down in the strange town discover that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes nosey and afraid of all of her neighbors and friends . Then strange things start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a hill that suddenly disapears ( that was creepy ) as well as seeing the little boy belonging to Orson Wells at the playgroud that he later asks the lady to help him bring back to life . The lady soon tries to escape the town but only to find herself traped by it 's inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all of what the spirit tries to warn her about . This movie is ok , it 's has it 's moments of suspense but it really could have done much better than to have Orson in there . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I go out to the video store to rent a flick I usually trust IMDb 's views on a film and , until this one , had never seen a flick rated 7.0 or above on the site I did not enjoy.Sidney Lumet , a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century , really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can : filling a film 's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever.I like films with flawed characters , but no matter how dark someone 's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too , we 're all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others . Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters.Ethan Hawke 's Hank is a 30-something whining , immature , irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he 's a loser , which he very much is . His indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he 's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed . By the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film , it 's more pathetic than uplifting . Ethan Hawke plays his character well , but isn 't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn 't ' particularly care that it 's there.Speaking of which his character 's wife is equally as bad . Just about every single shot of the film she 's in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non-existent self-esteem with insults . Seriously , that 's just about all the character does . Her harpy-like behavior borders on malevolent.Albert Finney plays their father Charles , and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades , he spends about 90 % of this film with the same mouth open half-grimace on his face like he 's suffering from the world 's worst bout of constipation . For someone who 's been an actor as long as Mr. Finney , you think he 'd be more apt at emoting . Even though he doesn 't show it much , his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger-filled . And when he smothers Andy at the film 's conclusion it 's akin to Dr. Frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it 's own misery.Marisa Tomei isn 't given much to do with her character . Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason . When Andy 's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship , but it really doesn 't make her any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film , but probably the one with the most common sense at least.And finally we come to Andy , played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman , is the only reason I rated this film a 3 instead of a 1 . His performance of the heroin-addicted , embezzling financial executive who 's " " perfect crime " " of robbing his parent 's insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing . His descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable , deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic . Hoffman 's character ends up being the film 's chief villain , but it 's hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who 's self-admitted poor early parenting led to his son 's eventual psychosis and indirect , unintentional murder of his mother.Ultimately this film is really only worth watching for PSH 's great performance and it 's family train wreck nature . Just don 't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for , because there really aren 't . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
What a horrible movie . This movie was so out of order and so hard to follow.It was so hard to follow and was just confusing . The whole time I was watching it I was wishing it would end ! ! I felt like I wasted 2hours of my life that I will never get back . Save your money and don 't rent this movie . I now see why Sarah Michelle Gellar was barely in the movie . The first movie was great but this was just sucked . I would never recommend this movie to anyone . Save your money and watch the trailer because that is about the only thing that is worth seeing with this movie . This movie had no real story to it either . I am still wondering what I watched . , negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" In a nutshell , skip this movie , it 's that bad . In short , this movie is about a weapons factory where secret weapons are being developed . Because they make bad things , they aren 't popular so to speak . A new female CEO comes in to clear things up , and make sure the reputation of the company will be improved . She does this by leaking company confidential information to the press ... Do you believe this ? Furthermore she starts to fire people she has never seen . Incredible uh ? A pacifistic group tries to destroy the company 's mainframe , because there are the blueprint located of those secret weapons . This mainframe is located in the bottom of the building hidden in a kind of vault . Of course the movie would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot which is the ultimate killer machine , which resembles like an ' Alien ' from the Alien movies . The mad scientist likes the female CEO.The mad scientist instructs the robot to kill everyone , and so protects his job , rise in chain of command , and make the movie interesting . The pacifists team up with the CEO and another person of the board of directors to escape from the robot . Further down the line they agree to blow up this evil computer mainframe , whilst avoiding the robot . They also discover that the factory was developing a part man , part machine soldier . They can erase a persons memory and replace it by a veteran soldier 's one . One of the pacifists is transformed in such a soldier and will hunt the killer robot . I guess the mad scientist also wrote the script of this movie . This super soldier looks and acts much the same as Robocop , though not as funny.It boils down to this . People are running , being chased by a killer robot , are hurt by it , but they do not seem to troubled by that , besides limping a bit , and of course the female CEO is the leading character of this movie , and cannot be killed , i.e. survives every attack , explosion , you name it . I won 't bother you by the chase , let 's skip to the end . They have lots of weapons , yes the pacifist too and they know how to use them . When they 're at the roof of the building they empty all there weapons upon the killer robot . They step into an elevator which is used to clean outside windows . And then the female CEO knows some magic as well , at the roof she was complaining about being out of bullets , and like magic the gun is reloaded . This way she can shoot the cables and let the elevator plummet 70 stories or so , and let it stop right above ground surface by pulling the brake . And to top it all off , the police is waiting there for them . The robot jumps after them , and kills the cops . Hilarious no ? The robot chases them down the vault where the mainframe is , and when finally the robot is so close to her , that he can touch / kill her , it stops . Because the mad scientist did not want her to be killed . A better name for this guy would be the idiot scientist . Although he is the one who made this movie watchable . At this moment I was already pulling for the killer robot to finish them all of , so the movie would end.I cannot believe that this movie rates this high , and this is why I wrote this comment . Avoid this movie like the plague . It 's a monster , and I 'm not talking about the Death Machine . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I 'm shocked that all the " " hated it " " ratings are sixes and sevens , still above average . To me , this seems a case of " " the emperor has no clothes " . " I understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70 's ... Regardless , it became a struggle to sit through and watch . The DVD I saw did have some subtitles , but about 75 % of the speech is not subtitled . Some of it is hard to understand . The Jamaican patois was cool to hear , but you struggle not to ' tune out ' after awhile . Some of the shots were nice , and the realism was there , even if some of the performances were not great . ( Jimmy Cliff did a good job ) The plot is not bad , but quite predictable . In the 1 : 43 film , the highlights are Jimmy Cliff ( Ivan ) singing for a scene , and a couple of shoot-outs and a fight . Probably 15 minutes or so . The rest is pretty boring . BTW , near the beginning of the film , there are some weird cuts with the Ivan character that seem like a editing mistake , which made me laugh for a bit . One reviewer said this film has been cut so many times , that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there . The ending was kind of interesting , showing how the media from a young age influences people , it could also be a general comment on the white man 's / colonialism 's influence on Jamaica . Other main themes are poverty , corruption , church , ambition ... In closing , the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile , the film much less . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As a " " lapsed Catholic " " who had 11 years of Catholic school , but hasn 't been to Mass in 35 years except for weddings and funerals , I thought I 'd get a kick out of this . And I did . . . for the first two-thirds of the movie . It was all the standard stuff -- strict parochial school teachings , repressed sexuality , etc . But then , suddenly , the movie turned mean . REALLY mean . Now mind you , I saw this before the pedophilia scandals hit . . . and maybe I wouldn 't have been quite so offended at such nasty , hateful digs at the Catholic Church if I 'd known about those abominations ( such a Catholic term ! ) and coverups.It 's been a few years since I rented the video , and I won 't go back to rent it again with a new perspective . It just left such a dirty , nasty , ugly taste in my mouth . . . I wonder what experience all the actors had with the Church , because either they * really * hate it , or they whored themselves for the paycheck . It 's an incredibly anti-Catholic movie , offensive to anyone who has a glimmer of a gleam of respect for Catholic education . Which I still do because there were no better teachers back in the ' 50s . Whatever else those nuns did , they forced me to learn how to read and write the English language . They made us memorize . ( How many kids today can do simple arithmetic in their heads ? ) Truth is , there 's nothing more essential for success in America . Can ya read ? Can ya add / subtract / multiply / divide ? Great . You can get any advanced degree you want . And the discipline of Catholic education will stand you in good stead , not just as you continue your studies , but also for the rest of your life , no matter what you think of the Catholic " " mythology " " we all had to learn.Such a great cast , such a lousy , rotten script . I really feel bad ( and no , it 's not " " badly " " -- trust me , the nuns taught me better ) for the writer and director.I thought I had mixed emotions about Catholic school . But the participants in this project must 've been those bad ( ie.e , stupid ) kids who sat in the back of the room , if they were willingly involved in making this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The rumor is true : girls like COYOTE UGLY more than guys . And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given . Jersey girl goes to New York to become a song writer . And after initial frustration of having no luck , overhears some girls partying about the $ 300 each they made last night . She gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise ! The place is completely full of " " two year old toddlers " " bursting at the sight of babes dancing.The story is not bad and some characters are likeable , especially Cammie ( the " " fashion coordinator " " part was cute ) and the bouncer but let 's face it , the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning . Violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie . And check out Violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer ! For the first time I could think of , how could the production be so terrible ? For a brief moment with this movie , Hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying , " " You were warned ! " " Instead , it seems COYOTE UGLY has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world . Advertising babes in a bar , but showing a paper thin " " pursue your dream " " story disappointed every male teen you targeted ! And finally , the music . There was absolutely no break of music I found in this movie , especially when it was needed ( the hospital scene ) . Every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened . But the climax was an ultimate laugher : an ' 80s like song you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on the stage and jam with Violet . Heck , I personally thought Bon Jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too ! Other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing ( especially the wet scene ) , and a couple cute cliches , COYOTE UGLY is something to be purely embarrassed about . Whether you watched or made it , it looked like nothing but time killing . Or wasting depending on how you look at it . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Mt little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs . We have seen just about EVERYTHING , especially zombie flicks . Now , we have seen a lot of good zombie movies , and a lot of bad ones . This BY FAR is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life . Not only was the acting horrible , but the special effects , graphics and ever " " zombie " " make-up was the worst I have seen . If you can even call it make-up ( black eye shadow around the eyes ) This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it 's cover . Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about. do your selves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

" This show is painful to watch ... It is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show , from the ever changing " " jobs " , " boyfriends , and cast . It appears that they wanted to cast Amanda Bynes in something ... but had no idea what , and came up with this crappy show . They cast her as a teen , surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings , and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy . Soon , they realize that she needs a " " clique " " and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers.How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me . Somehow , ABC has now decided that it is a " " family " " show , and thrown it into it 's afternoon lineup on ABC Family . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Probably the only thing that got the movie up to a four for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk . One of the world 's great portrayers of bumbling incompetence . . . and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster . As Pops Romano , he provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to Chris Kattan 's manic foolishness . Respectable performances are also offered by Richard Roundtree as the harried boss , Vinessa Shaw as a talented female FBI agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as Falk 's advisor and Benedict Arnold.The plot concept actually has some wonderful possibilities and , in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase , could have proved a great comedic vehicle . Kattan , who seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman , just provides a muddled mess . Sadly , Peter Berg and Chris Penn , who portray his misfit brothers , both fall far short of their proven capability.There are some very funny scenes , but they are far too few and separated by way too many boring ones . What I truly miss here is what always attracted me to the Leslie Neilsen movies . There is no ' second level ' of wit riding over the slapstick . No cultural references that only the adults get . . no double entendre . . it is just silly.And , by the way , this doesn 't all mean that I am recommending it for your 9-year-old , because hopefully they have better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I didn 't expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend . It was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out . Still , I held out hope . It sounded a bit much like " " Bride and Prejudice " " ( L.A. guy falls for an Indian beauty , parental conflict , blah blah blah ) . B & P was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters . " " My Bollywood Bride " " had none of that . The acting seemed stilted and way to by-the-numbers . Characters were so clich챕 the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student . Technically , the sound really bothered me . It seemed as if there was a lot of over-dubbing of dialogue . I mean a lot . I know sometimes it 's necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting.Two stars is being somewhat generous . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Man , this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books . Frankly , I found it too slow and unappealing right from the start . I kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened . This movie is vastly overrated.Shakespeare , with the King James English , has never appealed to me , anyway , so it may just be me . There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show Ronald Colman playing the role of Othello.The good points of the film include - thanks to a restored print - some decent cinematography and a young , slim and attractive Shelly Winters.Overall , this is simply too boring , too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again . Besides , we all know that most actors are nut-cases , anyway , but kudos to Hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" OK OK , it might be hard to put the entirety of a man 's life in one film . Traditionally therefore , biopics focus on one or two significant parts in the subject 's life . Now , Byron was a " " my week beats your year " " fellow , which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder . Furthermore , just as Byron 's poetry is inseparable from his life , the man 's life itself must be seen as a whole . Lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture , it 's showing a different picture altogether.Now , in short my review comes down to this : supposedly , Byron was indeed the " " my week beats your year " " prototype , a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime . True , he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in - but in the end , this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we 'd all want to lead , no ? Well , I did NOT , at ANY moment , want to live the life depicted in this film . So it gets 3 . Not for being so badly done ( which , direction-wise , it more or less was ) , but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot.Some more detail . Well , to over simplify things , a Byron bio should have two distinct episodes : 1 . Post-first Europe trip : England and his rise to fame + marriage / 2 . His life abroad . Now , the important thing is that the SECOND part should be at least as important as the first . Not only was it a lot longer , but the most significant change in Byron took place then . Furthermore , it 's where he created his best works ( Don Juan , the Vision of Judgement etc . - all the stuff that makes him * really * unique in English literature ) .Instead , in this film ( a ) Byron 's life never comes across as even remotely entertaining , ( b ) it only gets * worse * after he leaves England . They did two good jobs : first , they started at his return of his Europe trip ( though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue ) , second , they chose an angle , and they chose his incestuous love for Augusta ( who is rather perfectly cast ) . The problem with this last thing is that they never let it go . True , Byron remained strongly attached to Augusta for the rest of his life , but , especially as he was such a mood swing person , the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life.Anyway , the first part of the TV film should have ended with him leaving England . There 's no doubt about that . The thing is : once abroad , a life of debauchery began ( with the infamous Geneva period ) , but in Italy Byron also discovered a new life , both for his poetry ( inspired by Italian comedy ) , already in Venice , and for himself when he found the Contessa Teresa Guiccioli and moved to Ravenna ( afterwards , at the request of Shelly , with Teresa , to Pisa ) . In other words , he was also * liberated * . His mind and life opened up ( and not only in the decadent sense ) , while England 's closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the Victorian age . True , freedom was Augusta-less , but this bitter-sweet freedom tastes sour in this film . We see a lonely , bored snob getting older.I mean , hell , Byron never thought much about his poetry , except when he finally found his own voice in Don Juan ! Apart from poetic and romantic developments , his relationship with Shelly ( and the down-break ) should have been more documented . Also , it is in Italy in Ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas . This is important , as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of Childe Harold is changing into the more planted-in-life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of Don Juan . Life and work are one . True , still a bit naive , but it 's what got him to Greece ! And the whole thing came full circle in Pisa , where Shelley 's revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark . Missolonghi wasn 't the bored snob suddenly looking for some action . It was the insights in Italy ( the Gambas ) stirring him into action . It can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient-style battle excitement while the rest of Europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism . But it wasn 't just that , there was a true inspiration behind it . Meanwhile , Byron wrote massive amounts of Don Juan . True , his end is a bit sad , but it 's not like he 's worn out . THAT is the essence of Byron 's life : he may have had some strong emotional attachments ( 2 : Augusta and Teresa ) , but EVERY time he managed to reinvent himself truly . Meaning that he wasn 't ' less ' at the end of his life - no , he 'd made a physical and mental JOURNEY that , at the time , few people were prepared to make.I wonder . Why is it that so often the second period in Byron 's life is overlooked ? Because it had less obvious conflicts , as the man was finally coming to his own ? In focusing our attention on the frustrated England years fraught with scandals , we show ourselves to be not much better than the English aristocracy at the time , which Byron so despised , and which , despite the fact that he had no choice , he * willingly * fled in 1816 , to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a self-obsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It 's a testament to Gosha 's incredible film-making prowess that he was able to complete both Hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece , Goyokin , in the same year , 1969 . And it 's a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public ( compared to media darlings like the great Akira Kurosawa ) , that both Hitokiri and Goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them.Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo : mad dog killer , loyal to the Tosha clan and their boss Takechi , played by another genre stalwart , Tatsuya Nakadai . The Tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the Emperor against the flailing Shogunate . The historical backdrop is fairly accurate - with Japan 's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the Tokugawa and the pressure by the West to end a 300 year social and political seclusion . It helps a lot to know a thing or two about Japanese history and what eventually led to the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the Tokugawa Shogunate , but it 's not essential by any means . The movie was made primarily for a Japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well.As one would expect from a Hideo Gosha film in his golden years ( the late 60 's ) the visual palette is breathtaking , the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty . Style however is never decorative for Gosha - it is always employed in the service of story . And speaking of story , Hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character Izo Okada . As most chambara protagonists , Izo finds himself in a moral double-bind , torn between giri ( obligation ) and ninjo ( natural impulse ) - although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is . In the first half of the movie Izo is trying for social self-advancement . Lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat 's daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer 's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century Japan . The turning point for Izo is when he realizes at what cost self-advancement comes , the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self . It is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the Tosha Clan to a " " nameless " " drifter without past or future , Torazo the Vagrant . Although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in Yojimbo 's mold , it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego , ambition and self-dillusion that allows Izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself . Hitokiri ends ( which I won 't reveal here ) in the best way any story can end : both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives Izo the last laugh , a last sardonic remark in the face of death . , " positive , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Let 's just say I had to suspend my disbelief less for Spiderman than I did for Hooligans . That is , to say , I have less of a problem believing Toby McGuire can stick to buildings than I do Elija Wood throwing down with toughs in Manchester . I won 't get into specifics , as I don 't want to write a spoiler , but the idea of grown , professional , British men getting into near death scraps every weekend is , well ... funny . And this film is not . The fighting , the idea of fighting , is taken far too seriously . The gravity of the pugilism , the reverence with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating , as it neither establishes or resolves the conflict . It seems as though the plot , with holes big enough to drive a Guiness truck through , has been slapped together with a contrived " " fish out of water " " theme so that viewers can gaze into Woods teary eyes as he learns how to become a man ie. hitting other young men of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can . The characters are cartoonish , especially the Americans at Harvard . The character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture . Unfortunately , the absurdity of the film doesn 't reach its height until nearly the end , which by then you 'll have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back . Pick up " " The Football Factory " " or " " Fight Club " " instead of this corny , and disappointing dud .

" Well , here we have yet another role reversal movie . There were many worth watching , despite the tired plot of gender reversal . However , this one is not . In previous reviews , I think I 've made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for Haim movies that followed the late 80s . This is one of them . ' Just One of the Girls ' is about a high school kid ( Corey Haim ) who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school . He joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader , Marie ( Nicole Eggert ) . Obviously , he can 't keep up the charade for too much longer.I thought this movie was utter crap , and it wasn 't even funny . But , judging by a majority of reviews , it looks like fans of Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen , Nicole Eggert , are the only ones who 'd want to watch this . If you 're looking for a good Haim feature ( or role switching comedy ) , look no further than 1989 . This is about the point that Haim 's career tanked . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" I was not nearly as smitten with this as many other reviewers . Sure , it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic , lesbian vampires . Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way , hitch to their home ( at dusk ) , and invite their prey ... sex-starved men to their boudoir . What happens there ... well , after they disrobe and kiss each other mostly , they kill their visitors . Director Jose Ramon Larraz does have some flashes of brilliance with his camera . Some scenes are quite eerie and effectively shot , but sex alone does not hold a film up ( no pun intended ... at least consciously ) . There really isn 't much of a story here . We have the two girls . We are shown some inexplicable and unexplained beginning where we see them shot with pistol . Why ? What does it mean " " Why do we have the guy that stays for several days greet a guy at the hotel that insists he knows him from years ago ? Does that have a purpose ? Of course I have even more general questions like what is a couple of nice-looking girls doing as vampires in the English countryside and having a wine cellar filled with wine from the Carpathians ? Anyway , the script is riddled with such flaws . It is also very sparse on the action outside of catch victims , wine and dine them ( quite literally ) , and then go to bed in the crypt . The end gets going with some juicier scenes , but it is anti-climatic . There are , as I said , some effective scenes by the director ... I particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods looking for their prey . The house is also a most impressive set . And both girls are as I said very lovely . Marianne Morris in particular stands out - in more ways than one . For you older film fans , silent screen veteran Bessie Love has a brief cameo at film 's end . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie started out cringe-worthy--but it was meant to , with an overbearing mother , a witch of a rival , and a hesitant beauty queen constantly coming in second . There was some goofy overacting , and a few implausible plot points ( She comes in second in EVERY single competition ? ALL of them ? ) Unfortunately , the movie suffers horribly from it 's need to , well , be a TV movie . Rather than end at the ending of the movie , an amusing twist in which the killer is ( semi-plausibly ) revealed , the movie continues for another twenty minutes , just to make sure that justice is done . Of course , now that the killer is revealed , she suddenly undergoes a complete personality shift--her character gets completely rewritten , because the writers don 't need to keep her identity secret any more .

" The Brave One seems to indicate that the main character , of course , is brave . I 'd disagree . The more brave thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her- getting brutally beaten along with her fianc챕e who doesn 't live another day from it- is to go after the criminals without resorting to a total distorted view of society . Jodie Foster 's character , Erica , is a radio personality who 's niche is walking the streets and recording what goes on . We 're given no real depth aside from ' she had someone she loved , he died , the police don 't pursue it , she gets a gun , yada-yada-yada , she gets somewhat but not really involved with the lead detective ' into the character , and so were left with something leftover from past movies : the vigilante code of justice , where taking the power in one 's own hands is all there is . But we 're never too sure if Erica is sane or not , if the filmmakers take a position one way or another ( that is until the end , which is such a stupid message to take anyway , dog included as overbearing metaphor ) , while making the New York City of today , which has become significantly safer than , say , twenty years ago , look like you 'll get knifed or beaten if you go down just the right alley or just sit alone on a subway car.There could even be a somewhat better movie in the midst of all of this- perhaps just in the undercooked subplot with Terence Howard 's detective , who is involved in some custody battle of a child that isn 't his and a woman who he 's not linked to and a step-father who , I don 't know what aside from owning parking lots and being a bad dude- but we 're left to a script that 's both ham-fisted and disjointed with logic . It becomes laughable , for example , to see that at first the logical side- of Erica unable to really shoot properly , as seen in her first shooting in a convenience store at the convenient moment of a robbery of a wife by the husband- and then giving way to the illogical of her crack-shot at shooting at a pimp driving a car head on at her and killing him and ducking just in time to not get run over . It doesn 't help that Jordon 's style with the camera becomes a little more than insufferable : it 's called a stedi-cam for a * reason * , not because it can weave in and out.Ironically , the script and direction become very good , or rather work the best they can under the desired circumstances : when looking at the actual beating scene under the bridge , caught between a video-taped point of view by one of the criminals by the regular film cam in a pace that is perfectly disorienting . And when Erica first comes back on the air to her radio show , and she freezes up trying to do her old shtick , and speaks out a ' from-the-heart ' about how afraid she is- this scene , from Foster 's performance , to the clear direction and script , is the best scene in the film . But aside from that , there 's just a lot of posturing into a psychology that 's flimsy : is she a De Niro in Taxi Driver or a Bronson in Death Wish ? We have her narration over scenes , some of it doesn 't have to do at all with her radio show , observing how disgusted she is with walking around at night , nothing to do but her self-imposed task of cleaning up the streets . But unlike Death Wish , a movie that held more ambiguity and never held an answer at the end in a revenge scenario , the path of endless violence just heeds to a message , one that won 't be news to anyone who 's seen a second of Lifetime movie-of-the-week melodrama.The actors make do with what 's given , and in the end it becomes much more frustrating trying to stay with the anticipated , the hackneyed plot turns , and the plain old inexplicable ( plus the unintentionally hilarious , like a few expletives shouted by Howard after getting shot in one scene ) , and the temptation to walk out grows stronger and stronger . It 's a very problematic picture , with only a few moments of genuine interest and clear-headed convention-bending . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Despite having a very pretty leading lady ( Rosita Arenas , one of my boy-crushes ) , the acting and the direction are examples of what NOT to do while making a movie.Placed in southern Mexico , Popoca , the Aztec Mummy ( real Aztecs , by the way , DID not made mummies ) has been waken up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in Mexico City suburbia , during the first movie ( The Aztec Mummy ) . In this second part , the leading man and woman want to find th mummy and put it in its final resting place ( a fireplace would have been my first choice ... ) Into this appears The Bat , a criminal master-mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a " " human robot " " ( some idiot inside a robot SUIT ) to control Popoca and ( get this ) take over the world . The final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious , some of the worst choreography ever witnessed . The funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious Mexican movie studio !

" Thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor . David Morse is the responsible , straight-laced cop and ' good ' brother ; Viggo Mortensen , the ' bad ' boy , is a former soldier and ex-convict . As an actor ( particularly in his earliest years ) , Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performances under the Method . Turning first-time writer and director for this arty , obtuse drama , he works his script and characters out through the same methodical process , slowing the pacing down to a crawl ( ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and inflection ) . This approach might be fascinating if there were three-dimensional characters to care about , but photogenic Morse and Mortensen aren 't really convincing as siblings . Worse , we expect more from prominently-billed veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis , who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting . The picture is balky with turgid sequences , a wobbly narrative and confusing editing ( always slanted to point up the artistic excesses ) . Penn 's tricks with the camera show off a talented eye , yet they are mostly an irritation . * 1 / 2 from * * * * , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade B performance and he delivers a rather good one . Outside of Madsen and Hopper the acting is horrid ; you 've seen better at your local high school . The sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of B-movies . The scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes I 've ever seen ( it doesn 't even come close to fitting in the movie ) . The script was probably a great 10-page outline , but when it comes out to a full-length movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies Madsen left behind . I do have to say Hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the Hummer had me laughing out loud , but I don 't think that was the intent . Yes there is a little style , and Hopper can always draw my interest .

Thats just one of many things in this movie that made me ask , " " Where is the justice ? " " Why is late-night cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological mayhem ? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women , and seem to focus on them being terrorized and murdered . This film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process . All it ends up doing is turning the viewer 's stomach with its sickness , and insulting the viewer 's intelligence.The cast is misleadingly good . My guess is that they BAGGED Sutherland first , and used him to lure the others like lemmings into this.I 'm kicking myself for wasting time , giving this piece of garbage a chance . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" " " Air Bud 2 : Golden Receiver " " is a very bad rehearse in making a sequel in the course of a single year . The first film was cute , cuddly and charming . The idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched , but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept . Even the human story had some explanation to it . Josh 's father was killed in a plane crash , so he is sad . And the audience becomes emotionally involved as well.Now for the poorly made sequel . It is terrible . This is the worst kind of bad sequel , the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones . The kind that changes the main plot piece in one way , this time , the K-9 plays football instead of basketball . No madder how much time is spent in mind over matter , benefit of a doubt , walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this , there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making.The sequel stars Kevin Zegers as Josh , who is in eight grade . He lives with his mother and little sister in a Seattle suburb . In the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident , which the audience can relate to , most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one . In this movie , the emotional plot is a bit more complicated . Josh 's mother is dating once again . He and Buddy , his dog who can play basketball , don 't like this at all . Why ? If I were in his shoes I would love to have an extra parent in my life , especially one this nice . The man 's name is Patrick Sullivan , and Josh 's mother , Jackie , met him became he is a local veterinarian for Buddy.The animal story is too simple . Josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team , the Timber Wolves . The team itself looks like something from America 's Funniest Home Videos , the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other . So when Bud shows up one day , he proves he can play as a receiver for them , and is no doubt the team 's best player.Buddy 's extremely cute in his football costume . Oh , he is enough to melt the heart . The dog is the best in this movie as well . Too bad there wasn 't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team.There is a very bad sub-plot about Russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals , of course they try to catch Buddy . But their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a " " Home Alone " " scenario to them . " " Air Bud 2 : Golden Receiver " " is much more goofy than the first too . The Russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapstick that , I have to admit made me laugh , at the stupidity of it all . There are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movie-to see a dog play football.The performances were also quite the embarrassment . I liked Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo 's presentations , but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a D + . Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic.There were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers , but that isn 't even worth mentioning . Will children enjoy this movie ? Perhaps , but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep . They will most certainly complain that the dog didn 't get enough screen time in , and loath over the fast changing script , and protest against the boring performances , and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al " " Air Bud , " " as I did.I suppose that they will think the dog is adorable . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" How often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen , with torrid affairs and passionate encounters ? Almost never , if what I see as normal life around me is anything to judge by . Romances , as previously stated , are hardly ever earthshaking affairs that leave you at the top of the world or batter and bruised.Romance , in its every day form , as lived out millions of times over around the world , is a slow , subtle , and quiet affair . Something that grows in you , ever so slowly , probably without you even noticing it slowly taking over your being . No one can tell me when I am in love . For if someone did , I would not believe him anyway , for no one but me would know . And even then , it is just a feeling , a certain knowledge that you are feeling this exalting emotion . That you want nothing but the best for someone , that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness . That you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them . I would not go so far as to say be willing to die for your loved one , for we are all human , and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us.Is the love between the main characters of the film , ever so subtle and understated , no less noble than that between Romeo and Juliet ? The unstated emotions , the unsaid feelings , convey far more than any repeated shouts of " " I love you " . " The restraint shown by the lead actor , displayed ever so poignantly in the scene where he watches his love interest through the cafe window , yet never did he move to make himself known to her , was simply heart-wrenching to watch . Would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden , knowing that her emotions and feelings could not possibly be reciprocated ? On another note , how will I deal with my own certain death ? While I can claim I have been seriously ill , I can not in all honesty say that I have ever come close to death . Will I be so calm , putting all my affairs in order , and leaving instructions for others to take up what I leave behind ? I suspect I will be calm , for I will have little choice in the matter . Can I be so selfless ? Again , the answer will have to be in the negative . I can empathize with the anguish , knowing that your life is forfeit , that fate has dealt you a fatal blow , and that future events , however little there are of them left , are no longer under your control.Life is nothing more than a series of small events , the culmination of which may seem great for some in retrospect .

" After seeing the TV commercials for this film I marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs . In the end it was one of the longest 90mins I have ever spent . The Wog Boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn 't fill this void.A scene where the two ' Wog Boys ' dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all . The only character that was worth watching was ' Nathan ' , played by The Castle 's Stephen Curry , his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs.A word for this flic is boring .

" Why does this movie fall WELL below standards ? Ultimately , the answer lies in the poor , humourless script . A slim / average looking Travolta ( looking rather dapper in black I must say , even with a HUGE mullet ) and Gross both act very well as two young-ish ' slick-dressed ' but nevertheless dimwitted New Yorkers eager to open their own nightclub . Other than that , the rest of the film is just boring to watch . It is SO dull that it 's really not worth knowing what happens in the film 's climax on any level . Kelly Preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husband-to-be Travolta is one of the film 's few pleasures . Charles Martin Smith is quite fun to watch as struggling KGB honcho " " Bob Smith " . " Personally , I think the movie would have been better if the plot was altered a little so that the settings did not change from NY to ' Indian Springs , Nebraska ' ( which is in the former Soviet Union ? ) --you 'll understand if you see the movie ... Apparently , this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a 1987 release . I guess Paramount stalled on releasing the movie until January 1989 because of the unbelievable plot . It was reported they deemed it " " unreleasable " . " Nevertheless , this $ 6,000,000 film garnered a little over an embarrassing $ 163,000 in revenue as it was released only BRIEFLY in places like Texas and Colorado before heading straight-to-video .

" The film opens with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert . Reanhauer ( Bill Roy ) believes wholeheartedly in his power , and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack . Unable to keep him alive , all those involved , doctors and nurses , are sentenced for attack with Reanhauer 's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri ( .. big-chested Jill Jacobson ) targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance . Forced against her will , with no memory of inflicting such harm , Sherri 's host body murders selected victims . Fortunately , Sherri 's fellow co-worker , nurse Tara ( Marilyn Joi ) begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient , Marcus Washington ( Prentiss Moulden ) , once a star football player , whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo . Through Marcus ' knowledge , passed down from mom , Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save Sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly . Meanwhile , Sherri 's lover , Dr. Peter Desmond ( Geoffrey Land ) worries about her present condition and welfare.Well , this was my first Al Adamson film and I must agree with his detractors that , just from this film alone , it seems he holds them together with paper clips and Elmer 's glue . The animation with which we see the spirit take control of Sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable . A little soft-core nonsense as filler , some demonic possession thrown in the mix ( Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she 's possessed ) , with naughty nurse behavior ( .. the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited ) and a little bit violence / gore . The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast . The sexual situations aren 't that hard-core and Al often shoots them without revealing all that much . The film looks embarrassingly cheap and there 's an absence of thrills , although the chilling score ( .. which sounds like something from Dark Shadows ) does help a little bit . Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass ( .. as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she 'll even screw a nutty patient , always complaining of illnesses he really doesn 't have , with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal ) aren 't bad looking , and Adamson 's story-line , although frail , is somewhat coherent ( .. it seems he rarely directs films which are ) . Overall , the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions ( .. or , in my opinion , create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story ) . John F Goff has the role of the hospital 's psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri , not believing the idea that she was possessed ; he constantly bickers with Peter over her .

" What a disaster ! Normally , when one critiques a historical movie , it 's always fun to point out the inaccuracies that slip in , usually added by the writers to create more " " dramatic " " situations . However , " " Imperium : Nerone " " is a whole ' nuther kind of animal . In this movie you strain to find ANYTHING at all that is confirmed by the historical record amidst the farrago of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of Rome 's bad-boy artist-emperor.And it 's a pity , because Nero is one of the most fascinating of all the Roman emperors . His life was filled with enough tumultuous events and interesting people to make a really good movie . The producers of this mess chose another route , which leads only to head-scratching on the part of any informed viewer.Just a few examples : 1 . Nero is depicted as an 6-8 year old boy when Caligula has his father killed for treason , exiles his mother Agrippina , and sends the boy to be raised by slaves in the countryside . " " Ten years later , " " the story resumes just before the assassination of Caligula . Facts : Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his four year reign , and was only three when he was assassinated ; Nero 's father died of natural causes ; Agrippina was briefly exiled for bad behavior , not treason ; and Nero was not raised among slaves , but had the typical upbringing of a young member of the imperial family.2. Okay , according to the writers , Nero is now about 16 when his great uncle Claudius becomes emperor ( in fact he was about to turn 4 ) ; Agrippina engineers the downfall of the empress Messalina and marries Claudius , who adopts Nero . Then he goes off to conquer Britain , and is poisoned by Agrippina soon after his victorious return . Nero is declared emperor , although he 's still perhaps only 18 or 19 years old . Fact : Claudius conquered Britain in 43 A.D. , two years after beginning his reign . He lived until 54 A.D. Nero should have been 31 years old by then by any normal chronology , but in fact succeeded to the throne at age 16.History tells us that there then followed the " " Five Good Years , " " where Nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the philosopher Seneca and the Praetorian commander Burrus . This is shown -- sort of -- except that portraying the Roman Senate as opposing Nero 's good measures is false . Senatorial opposition to Nero only commenced when he started to show signs of insanity and began killing Senators for real or imagined treason.3. Nero 's mother Agrippina is the controlling sort , who murdered her uncle-husband to make her son emperor . After a while , Nero tires of her meddling and decides to kill her . In the movie , he sends his henchman Tigellinus to stab her to death . All true enough , but the reality was so much better ! Agrippina was a survivor , and didn 't go easily . Nero tried three times to poison her , but as an old poisoner herself she was savvy to all that , and he failed . Then he tried to crush her to death by collapsing the ceiling of her bedchamber , but that also failed . Next , he sent her on a voyage on a ship that was deliberately constructed to fall apart and sink ; as it went down , she jumped into the sea and swam to shore . Finally , he had her stabbed to death . Now showing all THAT would have definitely improved this movie ! Other errors abound : Nero 's lover Acte was not a childhood slave-friend , she never repudiated him , and there is no evidence that she became a Christian . Nero did not commit suicide by slitting his wrists while sitting beside a lake . Etc. etc. etc.The sources for Nero 's life are primarily the Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius , both of whom were of the senatorial class hostile to him and his memory . But the evidence indicates that he remained very popular with the common people , unlike one of the final scenes where he is pelted by the mob with vegetables as he leaves the city to commit suicide.WHY did the writers and producers take an inherently interesting story with plenty of good stuff for any movie , and make THIS piece of crap ? Oh , and did I mention how cheesy the sets and costumes were ? Lol.One star , because there 's no way to rate it lower . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do the crosswords , but for some reason she spends the time distractedly walking all around the city when she could be focused at home . The acting is horrible , the actress huffs and puffs as she tried to think of the words , and we are left completely in the dark .

" I made a big mistake going to see this film . That 's the lottery of going to see films I guess . After five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker , and I fought quite hard to stay in my seat - the old " " lose two hours of your life " " kind of feeling.The fundamental problem is that , without even mentioning the whole " " historical accuracy " " thread of reviews , the script is achingly , painful , bad.The first thirty minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a plausible , real , plot development . Instead , it lurched from from one undramatic " " dramatic " " event to the next . Having the girl cry at the start of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point . And that whole walking off into the sunset through the long-grass field at the end , what the hell was that about ? Not even the excellent Ed Harris could save this one . You could almost feel his pain at some of the lines he had to utter . The most fabulously awful one was , for no apparent reason , he stares at the girl as she copies his work in his apartment , she looks up , it all goes a bit fuzzy romantic kind-a lighting ( or am I dreaming ) , and he says , with authority in his voice , " " WASH ME . " " And she gets up and washes him , with a sponge . " " Wash me " " WTF ? That 's hilarious.And then there was the music . The long extended session when it was just Beethoven conducting and the 9th Symphony pouring out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waiting , waiting , standing there silently for what seems like forever . And then , finally , launching into enormous sound . It was spine-chillingly wonderful and dare I say it , it brought tears to my eyes.So that is where the film picked up two stars .

Me , personally , I 'm tempted to opt for the latter because I didn 't bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and undemanding early 80 's slasher with a nutcase in a Santa Clause costume butchering people . Wrong ! The movie actually handles about a bloke named Harry Stadling ; who 's obsessed with Christmas , works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment . Harry 's issues all started when he witnessed Santa 혯 his daddy in a costume obviously 혯 caress his mommy 's naked legs at a tenderly young age . After that he just developed into a social outcast , much to the irritation of his younger brother , who 's bound to snap one ( holi ) day . I fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie , but did it really have to be so boring ? There are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens . I can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed , but this movie doesn 't even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists ( with the notable exception of the finale , I must admit ) . Also , I would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children ! He doesn 't and exclusively kills misbehaving adults . How are you supposed to take wannabe controversial and original Christmas thriller serious when Santa doesn 't even commit one miserable child murder ? THAT would have made " " Christmas Evil " " a classic , whereas now it 's just a forgettable and pitiable piece of junk . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" Why did the histories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so dour ? Divorced women with indifferent daughters . And why very little reference to the original show and characters ? The daughter characters were silly and uninteresting . Why can 't there ever be daughters who like their mother 's on TV ? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis , and Rhoda would return to NYC , but why couldn 't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars ? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters . It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course , but it could have been better , much better .

" One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way : I was working in Roger Corman 's offices , like so many other wanabees before and since , I was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable ( hah ! ) . One afternoon Julie Corman , Roger Corman 's wife and a producer in her own right , asked me to load up a tape . I 'm not sure why she wanted to watch it . I got the impression it was a student film or a show reel , something like that , some sort of calling card . Whatever the reasons she had to see it , the only free video machine in the offices at the time happened to be in the room I was working in , and I was the nearest person to the machine . I started the tape.Fade in : On screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera . Behind him , screen left , was a door that opened into the room . Against the far wall was a coat rack . A second character entered through the door and started talking . The first character , the guy at the desk , turned round to reply , ( this is all one take , static camera , there are no cuts pans or dolly shots . Just one locked off camera ) . The second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line . Julie Corman said " " I 've seen enough . " " and left the room.What she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot . Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines ? Nope , sorry . Next ! That 's how long you 've got . Ten seconds . Cock it up in the opening shot and you are dead.I was reminded of that moment while I watched the opening of this piece of crap . After an interminably long travelogue of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into cages . A man carrying a gun laughs . A jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal . God this is boring ! Cut to the interior of the Airport . Two men meet . Aha ! Something is happening ! They shake hands . Cut to a different angle of the two men -- and the director crosses the line.The first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up . ' Not Crossing The line ' is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience . Audiences don 't like to be confused . Mystified ? Baffled ? Puzzled and intrigued ? Yes . Audiences love all of those . Confused ? No . You loose them . They walk out . ' Not Crossing The line ' is one of those things they pound into you at film school , or should . It 's basic stuff . It 's not an inviolable rule ( there are no inviolable rules ) directors break it all the time - but not on the first real cut of the movie.I thought , " " I 've seen enough " . " And switched off . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" It is the early morning of our discontent , and some friends of mine and I have just gotten through watching " " The Wind . " " Truly a disaster film . Not in the sense of forces of nature wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting populace , but rather an awful movie wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting audience . To give you an indication of how frustrating it was to watch this particular bomb , I 'll give you an example quoted during my first pained viewing . If given the choice of watching this movie for a second time and , say , boiling myself , I 'm afraid to say the choice would not be an immediate one . But rather than simply ranting " " ad peliculam " " with lousy one-liners , I 'm going to get specific as to why exactly my friends and I panned this particular film.To start this off , I like low-budget horror flicks . I even like artsy , low-budget horror flicks . I liked " " Cold Hearts " , " " " Midnight Mass , " " " " Jugular Wine , " " etc . Films that were ambitious and daring , even if they were lacking in production value , execution and even acting . Generally , an interesting premise , unusual camera technique or merely just a well done scene or two will save a movie that is running a little rough around the edges . With these provisos in mind , I would like to say conclusively that I hated " " The Wind . " " The movie was probably most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch . From the actions of the main characters , to the flow ( ? ) of the plot , to the big portents hinted at by the opening which ultimately aspired to dust ( and did not even attach themselves logically to what transpired in the remainder of the film , and left the viewer , expecting something more , with a sense of much ado about nothing ) . The dialogue was spotty at best , woodenly delivered and completely unrealistic . By this I mean , no one in any of the situations that the characters were in would have reacted the way the characters did , or said the things that they said in the way that they said them . There was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would have corrected this problem . Character interaction and development was abysmal . Claire , the " " lambent sex goddess , " " or so the aggravating , passive-aggressive lamesters in the movie thought , was so overt in her manipulations she may as well have pulled a gun on the characters . Nevertheless , she was the shining high point of the film . The other main characters ( with the exception of Mick 's Milfy Mom , who was not terrible ) are so indistinct that they may as well have been portrayed by the same actor . Let 's see if I missed anything : borderline personality , co-submissive goons with profound feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy , spurred to fits of puerile rage through the artless orchestrations of a loose-lipped bimbette-suddenly-and-unmasterfully-turned-Caligari . No , I think that about covers it.Lack of scope was also problematic . How did those involved with the making of this film expect the casual viewer to derive that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this amateurish , unbelievable , poorly-portrayed lust pentagon ( well , what would you call it ? ) that occurred largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere ? There were no witnesses to the " " atrocities " " presented . There were no witnesses anywhere in this film.The believability problems stemming from this lack of attention to detail were rife even from the point where the plot begins to sicken . Case-in-point : If that guy Bob took that route through the woods to come home from the gym , and here 's the key , * * * * every day * * * * , there 's a jolly good chance that someone else would have been around to see something at some point afterwards while the perpetrators argued vociferously about the crime scene . One would think that with the murder of a young man in the woods , said town would have been in an uproar , the characters would have been questioned , etc . But instead , there wasn 't a witness in sight ( other than Earl , the closet psychopath with no inner monologue ) . We suggest that there be no witnesses * for * this film , either . As for the quasi-homosexual meanderings present , I don 't have a problem with those either . It 's not as if they came as a surprise , considering we had been shouting as to the closet case stati of most of the male characters since the second scene . Again , not problematic in and of itself , but thrown in for the wrong reasons . It was utterly unnecessary , thrown in for pure " " shock " " and / or " " dangerous art " " value , and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective . What we had instead was an awkward attempt to redeem a boring , clumsy movie with a boring , clumsy plot . The poorly hinted-at sexual tension , which was only hinted at heavy-handedly in anticipation of this flaccid snogging scene , only pushed this film further down the totem pole from " " mediocrity warranting criticism " " to " " film sucking so bad that it lacks the inherent grace to suck enough to properly mock and harangue . " " So it is with most of the film , a lot of artistic fumbling , very little meat and a lot of aggravation . It 's not that we don 't get it . Oh , we got it , alright . We just don 't want it . Look , the very fact that we were cheering the bludgeoning in the final scene as the * only * tableau that made sense on its face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this film . Rather than moving briskly along as its name implies , this movie oozed languidly forward like the sweat trail working it 's way down the side of your nose while your hands are full . Argh . That sensation pretty well sums up the gut-wrenching frustration realized while watching this train wreck . There is no breath of fresh air with regard to this movie , only the stale miasma of bad ideas poorly realized , putrefying before coming to fruition . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" If any movie ever made Italians look bad , this is it.Duke Mitchell - what an A--HOLE . Duke Mitchell , I s--t on your grave .

Awww , but he doesn 't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence , so that means he can 't be all bad , right ? WRONG . Typical softheaded sentimental tripe.While I do understand why some people might be struck by and even , to a certain extent , admire the film 's audacious , totally un-PC verve ( it 's certainly unashamed of its own hatefulness and sense of self-involvement ) , but this doesn 't change the fact that the main character , Mimi ( and , by extension , Duke Mitchell ) , is thoroughly loathsome human being who earns not one iota of empathy or interest , especially given that Duke Mitchell is such a COMPLETE BORE as a performer .

" This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the " " Night Gallery " " show back in 1971 . The episode starred Sue Lyon ( of Lolita movie fame ) and Joseph Campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire , respectively . The vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child ( which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster ) while he goes out at night for blood . The baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire 's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror , has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult , and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child . She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally . She bolts out the door , the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over . I don 't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes . They should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one .

" " " Scientists at a remote lab experiment on ( insert scaly creature here ) and create out of control monsters .

I like bimbos and Hollywood-Hunk wannabes be eaten by CGI critters as much as the next person ... but where 's the plot or originality ? Granted , there are times when Sci-Fi Channel Shines . Battlestar Galactica , if a bit dark , can be very good . Writers have continued to pump life into the various Stargate offerings , and the latest BBC import of Doctor Who is surprisingly good.Even in the various " " giant animal " " movies on Sci-Fi , the animation seems to be getting better all the time . Compare the kommodo in this film to the rather clunky version in the first giant kommodo film on Sci-Fi.But goodness ... how about a different plot ? Maybe some -different- giant critter ? On a whim , I started searching around the internet . Among the litter I found a few interesting stories which might appeal to SF fans and out of work Russian CGI animators at once . I offer http : / / www.macrophile.com / ~ arilin / archive / metamorphosis-day to the network with a suggestion that they contact the author for the story rights . ( The story contains violent images generally on a par with those of various Sci-Fi channel offerings ) .The story has subplot , ethical and moral comment on the nature of humanity and ends not on one of those horrible " " did they REALLY kill all the monsters ? ? ? " " moments , but rather leaves you guessing completely and in an entirely different mindset.Which is generally what science-fiction is supposed to do , no ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Why is it that every time I mention this movie to somebody , I have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it . I have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist upon a twist is deemed " " genius " " by anyone who watches it . Is that really what film has become ? Or is it that any time someone says " " Wow , that is so cool " " everybody has to agree with them and has no opinion of their own ? How this movie has a 7.5 rating is a disgrace to the film industry in general . It has also become yet another movie that " " needs " " two sequels for it , so I am going to have to hear about this horrible franchise for quite a while longer.Now to the film and why it is so bad . The original concept of it is actually not that bad , as there has not been a good serial killer movie in a while . The writing for this film is horrible as well as the execution . OK , so its a low budget movie , but that should not change the story or writing . The actors could not be worse in their attempt to make us scared of this killer or just scared of this movie . So they go out and get a big name in Danny Glover , but his talents ( whatever those are ) are wasted because HIS CHARACTER IS WORTHLESS . Why was he even in this movie ? What was his whole fight at the end turned out to be useless and misleading for what the audience believes is happening . This is of course the filmmakers intent , but couldn 't there have been a better way to do this without making us watch all that garbage . And then the " " big " " twist comes ( was this the third or fourth ? ) and the whole audience is shocked and walks out of the theater like this is some kind of masterpiece . Sure the movie gets people talking about the storyline and what not , but that was not the only flaw in this film . The direction was trying to be way too creative with what it was working with , and the flashback sequences were used merely as a shock effect.After watching this movie , even if you enjoyed it , go back and review the film and you will soon understand why it is not worthy of the praise it is receiving . For an amazing serial killer film check out Se7en if you have not done so . That is what this film wanted to be . I have gotten into more arguments about this film than probably any others and will continue to argue against it . Please do not support this franchise for not only your sake , but mine and everybody else 's sake as well . Hollywood needs to find a good horror movie to make , rather than 1,000 remakes , sequels , and " " shock " " factor films ( such as this ) . Oh yeah the saw 2 tag line sounds real promising : " " Oh yes , there will be blood . " " Yaaayyyy ! ! ! ! Sweet ! ! blood , that must mean its good right ? Give me a break . Sorry everybody who love this movie , but poor writing , flashy direction , and bad acting does not make a good movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Lord , this sucked . There 's a particular sort of sexual revolution flick from the 60s that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation . This film is an example . I lost track of how many times women are slapped , hit , whipped , or spanked in the film . And then there are all the times that women in the film fantasize about being slapped , hit , whipped or spanked ( you know they want it , right ? ) . Sometimes it is ostensibly part of safe fetish play-acting . Other times it plainly isn 't , but you will wait in vain to see the heroine report to authorities that she has just been raped . Instead we get to hear her being lectured by her rapist about her inability to " " let go " . " Every scene of this film reeks of misogyny ( speaking as a straight , white , married man in his late 30 's , not a teenage lesbian women 's studies major with a chip on her shoulder , lest you get the wrong idea ) .Perhaps the one good thing about this film is that it provides a stark reminder of just how bad things really were for women only a few short decades ago . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I happened to have seen this movie this morning on TCM . Very bad acting , low budget and poor plot are the impressions I felt while watching the movie . The only highlight of the movie was watching tender young Rita Moreno , ( 23 years old ) , playing a teenage Indian squaw in love with an older man in his 50 's . She reminded me of a earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita ( 1962 ) , only a more innocent Lolita . She bounces up and down like a 1950 's teeny bopper , almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum , falling all over this old man , willing to give him anything , as he plays it off like she 's a hindrance to him . Any man in his 50 's that had a beautiful , virgin , teenage girl willing to do ANYTHING for him and be his bride , would be insane not to take advantage of her . It 's too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didn 't permit more of an expansion of a character such as Rita Moreno 's . The only reason why I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is Rita Moreno 's appearance in the movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" As someone who loves baseball history , especially the early 20th century in which Cobb was a main figure , along with a ton of colorful characters , I was looking forward to seeing this baseball film . Well , it wasn 't a baseball film , which was disappointing . No , it was just a sportswriter 's account of being with Cobb in the ballplayer 's later years while the two collaborated on a book . Even at that , this could have been a more appealing movie than they made it.Granted Cobb was anything but a nice guy , an extremely talented player but brutal in that he would do anything to beat you .... and he was viscous , intimidating and had a lot of demons to fight . He was so hated his own teammates tried to hinder his chances of winning a batting title one year . Nonetheless , this an over-the-top portrayal of the man . It makes him into something almost cartoon-like . Watching and listening to an old man rant , rave and profane for two hours is entertainment ? No , it isn 't . Some day , I 'd love to see a real biopic of Cobb showing him in his ballplaying days and if they want to portray him as an evil guy , so be it , but the way they did it here with just a bitter , blasphemous old man making an ass of himself in front of a reporter is not fun to watch . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" My thoughts on the movie , 9It was not good , not good at all . Visually , it was great . I was pleased with the pacing , the camera angles , etc . However , the characters ? eh , kinda bland . Plot ? It sucked.This movie seemed more new age crap than anything else . Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful . Science isn 't portrayed any better . It creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but " " souls " " have the power to destroy monsters and bring life ? Really ? That 's something that bites my ass a bit too . Here we have a CGI movie ... created with science ... and they 're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us ? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask , " " Okay , so now what ? " " ( or something similar ) . I couldn 't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit . It was a " " okay ... it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now let 's get out of here as fast as possible ! " " type of exit.This is one of those movies where you can 't think if you want to enjoy it . Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily . Any thought as to , " " what 's the point of that ? " " will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing.Okay ... SPOILERS follow.So , basically , a scientist creates " " the Machine " " that is capable of creating other , intelligent , robotic life . Evil humans use it as a weapon . However , the scientist realizes that he is also at fault . He gave the Machine his intellect , but didn 't give it his heart . The Machine goes Skynet on humanity 's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth , finally slowly powering down . However , the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock-puppets . Each one , containing a piece of the scientist 's soul.The last one , # 9 wakes up not knowing anything about the world . He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up . He meets up with another like himself , # 2 . Well , # 2 gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine . # 9 finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue # 2 . They succeed . # 9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly . He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life ... pulling out # 2 's soul in the process.The movie then continues with action scenes with # 9 trying to rescue his soul-yanked compatriots . They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine . They release the souls of their fallen friends , who go up into the clouds . It then rains and we see life returning back to the planet.Hunh ? ! ? That makes no sense . None at all . Why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 homunculi ? What did it accomplish ? Were they created to stop the machine ? Everything is dead ! The machine was dead ! Why bother ? ! ? Why did he expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had ? Why not create a second intellectual machine , but with a " " soul " " to fight the first .. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success.Why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth ? Why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" John Carpenter 's career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication . His excuse is that he only produced it . Jon Bon Jovi looks like a girl . In fact , Bon Jovi and the two Vampire girls , Natasha Wagner and Arly Jover probably all fit in the same clothes . In short , it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp-model sort of way . Bon Jovi has the most charisma . At least he looks happy when he is smiling . The two Vampire Girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints . At one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss , but stop . Amazing how each Vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires . At one point , Arly Jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb Vampire Hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act . It would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof , and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched Arly Jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening . As far as gore is concerned , a few heads are ripped off , and the blood spurts profusely . These scenes have so little suspense or build-up that when they happen it is almost funny , and there is no " " horror " " pay-off from the scene . All you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of " " Wow , that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls . I wonder who has to clean it up . " " Throughout the movie , these Vampire Hunters who are obviously trying to kill Arly Jover ( the top vampire in the world ? ? ) keep reaching out to her . At one point , Bon Jovi goes into the abandoned Church and after he just shot her with an arrow ( and has done so on other occasions ) , he says " " I am not trying to hurt you . I just want to talk to you . I want to get to know you . " " HUH ? ? Of course , the dumb vampire Arly jumps out to say hello and Bon Jovi sticks her again with another impaling device . " " Why Can 't We Be Friends " " the 1970s hit song by WAR should have been the theme song for this movie . Aside from all of the other silly moments , there is a transfusion sequence when Natasha Wagner has all her Vampire blood removed , and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion . I guess Blood Type is not important ? Anyhow , all her Vampire blood is removed . Bon Jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him , he can beat Arly by becoming a vampire also . Of course , as the vampire blood is transfused into him , none of his healthy blood is removed . So apparently Bon Jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body . And just like the first VAMPIRES , this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,

" This movie is another one on my List of Movies Not To Bother With . Saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent , stayed up late to do so , was very annoyed to find that it was about 95 % romance , 4 % everything else , 1 % history if that . It 's what I call a bait and switch movie , one with an interesting title , the actual movie is a scam . This is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment , this movie is almost an insult to those who served . The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes , they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France . And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunter 's character . Flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls , an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn 't have lasted two days , it would have either been the stockade or the infantry . Discipline in the French Army was often rather fierce . In short , another Hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Firstly , the title has no relevance whatsoever to the movie . It started off fine with good development but got annoying when he couldn 't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him . Even his attempt to tell the police failed , which just added to the annoyance value . There were too many pregnant pauses in the movie that seemed more like filler than anything worthwhile . The plot never revealed who did this crime to him although a good plot would have allowed disclosure . The ending was nothing short of " " hey we 've run out of budget let 's stop it here NOW ! !

It 's a shame it 's not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies.They should have saved the money on getting D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right . Even Gary Coleman wasn 't properly utilized for his role.This movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots . After viewing this movie , I 'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of Napolean Dynamite-like humor , where it 's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery . Unfortunately , this movie fails to deliver the lines , the characters , the delivery or the humor . I should have gone to the dentist instead ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" With several name actors ( Lance Henrikson , David Warner , Joe Don Baker ) , why was Jeffery Combs given the lead ? Henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead , as would Warner , Baker or even others in the movie such as Charles Napier . Combs was miscast in this , and did a poor job of it . Everything he did seemed fake or contrived.The script is poor . Meaning that if Lance Henrikson ( or another ) had the lead role , he might have saved the film ( removed it from my " " waste of time " " category ) , but it still would have been a bad movie . The screen play was completely lacking . The director should have recognized this and helped the movie along . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The future of fantasy never looked so dark ! Christopher Lambert gets to fight the evil demon Grendel in this grim looking trashy fantasy-epos . " " Epos " " I said ? Er ... there 's only one location , so you can 't really call it an epic adventure , can you ? The location is a medieval / futuristic 5 inch tall castle , so how did they manage to cram in all the actors ? Oh , I get it , those where special effects . A miniature . Silly me.Here 's some reasons why you might want or NOT want to watch this motion picture : - Lambert gets to do his sword-swinging tricks over again like he did in Highlander.- The sets and costumes are amazingly cool ( if you 're a 12-year-old ) .- Rhona Mitra has a voluptuous pair of knockers which she likes to show off through-out the whole movie.- ... er , Christopher Lambert has white hair ... - Every time they start fighting , this over-the-top raving techno-soundtrack gets going . So why are these medieval slayer-dudes fighting while they should be dancing.- They don 't have electricity in this castle but they do have speakers installed which seem to work fine . So where 's the amplifier ? I guess they borrowed it from the techno-dj who delivered the soundtrack.- Watch it for the climax in the end which features an outrageous demono챦d CGI creature coming straight out of any Playstation 2 survival-horror game.If all this got you interested , then go watch it ( at your own risk ) , but don 't tell anyone I told you to . I strongly suspect Pinhead visiting the set while shooting , because this movie has no soul . Anyway , if you want to see beautiful Rohna Mitra really show some skin , then watch Paul Verhoeven 's HOLLOW MAN . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" The title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence , but it is not good at all . One 15 minute sequence with Jack Black beautifully playing one of his songs and tripping on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all . Every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things , except for the main girls I could not think of one movie where I had seen them before . I hate to bash movies but I also hate not being able to find something decent in movies . The film is sad , not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast . If it were redone and written over it could be awesome . If you want a good movie to see stoned , watch Grandma 's Boy , or Half Baked or Dazed and Confused , but this is not a movie to be seen at all . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" For the most part , " " Michael " " is a disaster 혯 ten minutes of charm and ninety 's worth of missteps.Travolta and MacDowell do their best , frequently rising above Nora Ephron 's numbingly banal script . But the film moves like a snail . And even within its fantasy context , the characters behave implausibly on a regular basis . ( Reporters who routinely let the story of a lifetime 혯 an apparent angel living on Earth 혯 out of their sight ? ) Someone forgot to tell romantic comedy maestro Ephron that William Hurt , brilliant in so many other films , is no Tom Hanks . The movie 's " " climax " " redefines the word contrived . Ephron may be shooting for Heaven here , but unfortunately " " Michael " " is a long , long ride through cinema heck . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" 90 minutes of Mindy ... Mindy is a tease to boyfriend Bill ... Mindy prances at the high school dance ... Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur , shoplifts a loaf of " " shepherd 's bread , " " Mindy nearly gets gang-raped ... Ah , the pleasures of Crown International drive-in features . You must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on DVD players . They were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their Pintos and Citations . The lack of pacing and structure didn 't matter to the original audience -- they probably only tuned in when the T & A on screen matched what they were up to , out in the parking lot . The film is really irritating when watched as a story . It 's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it . My favorite inanities : 1 ) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy . With no luggage or change of underwear , they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher , just like in real life . 2 ) After being abducted and nearly raped by depraved bikers , and after their innocent friend " " Pan " " is savagely beaten , Mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road . Mindy immediately brightens up and chirps , " " I 'm going ' to Big Sur ! ! " " But again , it 's a lot more fun to talk / read about than sit through . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" I saw this with high expectations . Come on , it is Akshay Kumar , Govinda , and Paresh Rawal , who are all amazing at their comedy , I was really hoping for a laugh riot . Sadly , that is not what I got at all ... Unfortunately , nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud . There were times when I chuckled at one or two things , but nothing really made me laugh . In short , it was badly attempted comedy , and in a way , a bit of a Hera Pheri wannabe.Out of the three main guys , I think Paresh Rawal 's role was the most powerful . It wasn 't the biggest role , but it certainly stood out more than Govinda or Akshay . Their performances were okay I guess . Nothing special , just mediocre . Though Govinda stole the limelight from Akshay in more than a few scenes . Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta also make appearances in this film , and both of them were pretty bad . Lara 's role did not move me , or make me laugh , and Tanushree Dutta 's character just got on my nerves ! The music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag . My favourite song is " " Tere Bin " , " followed by " " Afreen " , " which I really liked . " " Signal " " and the title song " " Bhagam Bhag " " are also worth a listen.You either will like it or you won 't . And judging by the poor comedy and lack of direction , I don 't think you will . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" And I repeat , please do not see this movie ! This is more than a review . This is a warning . This sets the record for the worst , most effortless comedy ever made . At least with most of the recent comedies nowadays , the gags are crude and flat , but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny . I never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos : Everyone thinks they can do comedy , and only 10 percent of them are right . Comedy is hard ! This is not some genre any fool can play around with . I think it 's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to " " Kentucky Fried Movie . " " Basically , these bozos are comparing their so-called comic talents to those of the brilliant Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers . Come on , I 've seen Pauly Shore movies that are 10 times funnier than " " The Underground Comedy Movie . " " Here 's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie : One sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named D * * kman . The whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen . That 's it . That 's the whole joke . Wow . This is enough to make Carrot Top roll his eyes . Another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie . And in another sketch , there 's a bag lady beauty contest , in which we 're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini-clad middle-aged women with beer guts and stretch marks . Plus , making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny . It 's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped . The whole movie is supposed to be a satire . I think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire ... is TRUTH ! ! ! For anybody who actually enjoyed this crap , explain to me what is truthful about ANY of these gags ! Some of the sketches might 've sounded funny on paper , but anybody who 's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper , it probably won 't be funny on screen . If I tell someone about a big , black , muscular gay virgin , who 's saving himself for the right man , he or she would probably laugh . But watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag . I hate how whenever people criticize a low-brow comedy like this for not being funny , they 're regarded as stuck-up squares . I just saw " " White Chicks " " recently . That 's another low-brow , politically incorrect comedy , but I laughed my head off . The most offensive thing about " " The Underground Comedy Movie " " is it 's not funny ! What the writers and directors don 't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn 't work . There has to be more ! Just think of the famous scene from " " There 's Something About Mary " " ( ironically , enough the bozo filmmakers put the Farrellys on their special thanks list ) . The joke about the semen wasn 't just funny because it involved bodily fluids . There was a buildup . Ben Stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn 't go out on a date with a " " loaded gun . " " Then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released . A knock is on the door , and he has to answer it . His date , Mary , is at the door and that 's when it 's revealed that the semen is hanging off Ben 's ear . In this movie , there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people , with no buildup whatsoever . As Jay Leno always says , " " This comedy thing 's not so easy , is it ? " " Keep that in mind , Vince Offer , ' cause you weren 't cut out for this genre ! ! The only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip . Let 's face it , nowadays it 's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect . I know comedy is subjective ... but this movie shouldn 't be funny to anybody , except maybe the filmmakers themselves . As a side note , the movie had to have been made before Michael Clarke Duncan 's fame in movies like " " Armageddon " " and " " The Green Mile . " " There can 't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show . All the others in the cast are either non-actors , has-been actors or B-movie stars . Karen Black made a good impression in " " Five Easy Pieces , " " but I don 't think she 's done anything of value ever since . Slash was probably drugged into being in this film . Gina Lee Nolin is nothing without " " Baywatch . " " Angelyne is the film 's biggest star ( keeping in mind Duncan wasn 't famous at the time ) , and there are still probably a ton of people who haven 't heard of her--for good reason . Usually , I 'm in support of extremely low-budget flicks , but this one deserves to drift into obscurity . I hope to Lord this doesn 't become a cult classic ! Shouldn 't there be a law against distributing crap like this ? , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" To be hones , I used to like this show and watch it regularly , but now ( thank god ! ) I don 't understand why did I watch it . Sex and the city is one of the most pointless and insulting TV shows I 've ever seen . I really don 't get the point of this show , despite of trying . People are saying , that Sex and the city is funny . In what way ? By cursing all the time , talking about vibrators and the size of the penis ? Give me a break.I don 't understand the plot : we have four girls who are trying to find a perfect man by sleeping with every dork , who comes around . And this show is all about four spoiled chicks , who are sleeping with every man in the city , but in the end they admit the best pleasure comes out of the penis vibrators . And yeah ... the show is trying to tell us , that sex is the most important thing in every relationship . If you can have a good sex , you 're a good husband ( or wife ) . It doesn 't matter if you want to be loyal and having a good heart .. the size does matter.The biggest problem is also bad acting . The four main actresses ( Sarah Jessica Parker , Kim Cattral , Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis ) are so bad and unconvincing , that it makes me sick just watching this show . Parker is just screaming and complaining all the time , Cattral is showing her old boobs and saying " " the f - word " " all the time , Davis delivers her smile ( and nothing else ) and Nixon acts like she is bored all the time . And yes ... men are sex - hungry pigs in this show . But , judging by this show , women are not much better . This show is insulting for men and women . The women are shown so primitive and emotionless , like they don 't have any heart , just hunger for sex . It 's insulting for everyone.Sex and the city is one of the worst TV shows and I 'm glad that the show ended , because it delivers bad acting and pointless stories . The whole world is not all about sex and vibrators . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Hello it is I Derrick Cannon and I welcome you to the first ever Cannonite review show . My movie for this week was debatable , what route what movie , what excellent four star epic would I choose , guess what I decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route , I 've decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept . The movie I will review today is Jack Frost Two revenge of the mutant killer snowman . The Stars in this movie include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller , Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller , Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners , Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun , Ray Cooney as the Colonel and Scott MacDonald as the killer snowman himself Jack Frost.It 's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny Jack Frost ( loved the carrot scene ) , but it 's even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast . The movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and Captain Fun was introduced . What was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie ? The only possible reason I could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder . Sam Tiler seemed more paranoid then he did in the original , his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display I had seen in a movie . His wife however was one of the few bright spots . She played her role as the main woman to a hilt . She was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy . The scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie . Ray MacDonald once again did a great job as Jack Frost despite what he was given . If it wasn 't for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like Chucky , Freddy and Jason . Laugh if you must but when it comes down to it Jack Frost had spunk , he had humor , and most importantly he had an undoubtable vicious streak.This movie could have been so much more , it could have been a continuation of a great franchise , instead any plans to make a Jack Frost three have been canceled.This movie gets a two out of ten for me , and it 's lucky that it even gets a one . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This movie is a disgrace to the Major League Franchise . I live in Minnesota and even I can 't believe they dumped Cleveland . ( Yes I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good , and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League , but still be consistent . ) Anyway I loved the first Major League , liked the second , and always looked forward to the third , when the Indians would finally go all the way to the series . You can 't tell me this wasn 't the plan after the second film was completed . What Happened ? Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and don 't watch this junk . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" A remake of Alejandro Amenabar 's Abre los Ojos , but this time with a living , breathing mask as a lead . For the dubious advantage of an English sound track , we endure Tom Cruise 's soulless performance , as usual , with zero depth . Yes , the character is identified with his persona , but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest . His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz.There is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means . Cruise 's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor . Do see the 1997 original Amenabar Open Your Eyes ! , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" When I first tuned in on this morning news , I thought , " " wow , finally , some entertainment . " " It was slightly amusing for a week or so ... But we have to face it , these news reporters ( if one can even call them that ) have WAY TOO MUCH " " playing around " " time.At first , I thought Jillian was a breathe of fresh air . But seriously , this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her . She is very unprofessional . She keeps on interrupting Steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report . It 's just really become annoying to the point that I can 't watch it anymore.Jillian is NOT a good journalist . Hell , she 's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity . Hence , she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she 's supposed to be interviewing . She 's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that 's all I can say about her.Also ( disappointingly ) , this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world , the government , the US , or something that will benefit and / or serve the public 's best interest . They 're too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product . On the other hand , their field reporters are interestingly tolerable ... I believe " " Good Day LA " " is for young teenagers and celebrities , and it is definitely not for people who actually CARE about the news.SIDE NOTE : ( I 'd really rather watch KTLA . However , they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes . They 're still a bit dull though . Oh well , I 'll stick to NBC 's " " Today . " " ABC 's " " Good Morning America " " is also okay ... as long as Diane Sawyer doesn 't become way too serious . ) , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Lame , lame , lame ! ! ! A 90-minute cringe-fest that 's 89 minutes too long . A setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility ( an abandoned convent ) is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky , witless dialogue that 's straining oh-so-hard to be hip . Mostly it 's just embarrassing , and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat ( a sample of this movie 's dialogue : after demonstrating her artillery , fast dolly shot to a closeup of Barbeau 's vigilante character혚she : ' any questions ? ' hyuck hyuck hyuck ) . Bad acting , idiotic , homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects , it looks like the director 's watched ' The Evil Dead ' way too many times . I owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they 'll never get back . What a turd . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Les Visiteurs , the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny . I like Jean Reno as an actor , but there was more . There were unexpected twists , funny situations and of course plain absurdness , that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes.Now this sequel has the same characters , the same actors in great part and the same time traveling . The plot changes a little , since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers . So they jump up and down in history , without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie . The duke , Jean Reno , tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing , but his character has been emptied , so there 's not a lot he can do to save the film.Now the duke 's slave / helper , he has really all the attention . The movie is merely about him and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be . Fact is ; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience , but he does not succeed . It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke , you already know , but he insists on telling that joke till the end , adding details , to make your suffering a little longer.If you liked Les Visiteurs , do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel . If you didn 't like Les Visiteurs , you would never consider seeing the sequel . If you liked this sequel ... well , I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs . He 's known throughout the world as a globetrotting TV reporter . Less well-known but equally effortful are his exploits as a full-time philanderer.I saw ' Vivre pour Vivre ' dubbed in English with the title ' Live for Life . ' Some life ! Robert seems to always have at least three women in his life : one mistress on her way out , one on her way in , and the cheated wife at home . It helps that Robert is a glib liar . Among his most useful lies are ' I 'll call you tomorrow ' and ' My work took longer than planned . ' He spends a lot of time and money on planes , trains and hotel rooms for his succession of liaisons . You wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants down.Some may find his life exciting , but I thought it to be tedious . His companions , including his wife , Catherine , are all attractive and desirable women . But his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceitful , you wonder if he 's enjoying all this.Adding to the tedium is considerable footage that doesn 't further the plot . There are extended sections with no dialogue or French-only dialogue . We see documentaries of wars , torture , and troop training interspersed with the live action . When Robert 's flight returns from Africa , we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal.Annie Girardot is the standout performer in this film . Hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection . It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career . I can 't find fault with Yves Montand 's performance of what was basically an amoral bum.I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouch 's novel techniques . In a hotel room scene , the camera pans around the room as Robert and his mistress argue . We catch sight of them briefly during each pass around the room . In another scene set on a sleeping car of a train , Robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower . Robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news , but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train . I sensed that his wife was also unable to absorb every word due to the shocking nature of the news . I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa . The cinematography of those scenes and of those in Amsterdam was superb.I reviewed this movie as part of a project at the Library of Congress . I 've named the project FIFTY : 50 Notable Films Forgotten Within 50 Years . As best I can determine , this film , like the other forty-nine I 've identified , has not been on video , telecast , or distributed in the U.S. since its original release . In my opinion , it is worthy of being made available again . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" This is your typical junk comedy.There are almost no laughs . No genuine moments . No memorable lines . No scenes where you think to yourself , " " that was clever " . " Nothing . The plot is embarrassingly bad . It 's ugly to look at and boring as hell ! There is no substance here . This movie has nothing . It doesn 't matter if Farely was in this or not .

Also , David Spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same lousy character in ever movie / TV show that he 's in.This movie was dead on arrival . There is no life here . No fun .

" I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns , taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college . I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a " " good Catholic " " in the church 's eyes because I don 't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to.So back to the movie ... its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead . There is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of Diane Keaton . I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good.At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary 's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith . But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy ... the tragedy of loss of life ( besides the two former students ... the lives of the aborted babies , the life of the student 's mom ) , the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people , the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God .

" I 'm going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with Maltin on this one . This is a second rate , excessively vicious Western that creaks and groans trying to put across its central theme of the Wild West being tamed and kicked aside by the steady march of time . It would like to be in the tradition of " " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " , " but lacks that film 's poignancy and charm . Andrew McLaglen 's direction is limp , and the final 30 minutes or so are a real botch , with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum . ( Someone give me a holler if you can explain to me why they set that hillside on fire . ) There was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene , and the woman 's reaction afterwards certainly did not ring true . Coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge , but all of his fellow escapees are underdeveloped ( they 're like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward ) . Michael Parks gives one of his typically shifty , lethargic , mumbling performances , but in this case it was appropriate as his modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring about . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
" No one expects the Star Trek movies to be high art , but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes . Unfortunately , this movie had a muddled , implausible plot that just left me cringing - this is by far the worst of the nine ( so far ) movies . Even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can 't save this movie - including the goofy scenes with Kirk , Spock and McCoy at Yosemite.I would say this movie is not worth a rental , and hardly worth watching , however for the True Fan who needs to see all the movies , renting this movie is about the only way you 'll see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie . , " negative , , , , , , , , , , , ,
